Their findings, which are presented in the scientific journal EMBO Molecular Medicine, are based on human studies and laboratory experiments. Various university hospitals across Germany were also involved in the investigations. The biomarker described by the team led by Prof. Andr  Fischer is based on measuring levels of so-called microRNAs. The technique is not yet suitable for practical use; the scientists therefore aim to develop a simple blood test that can be applied in routine medical care to assess dementia risk. According to the study data, microRNAs could potentially also be targets for dementia therapy. When symptoms of dementia manifest, the brain has already been massively damaged. Presently, diagnosis happens far too late to even have a chance for effective treatment. If dementia is detected early, the odds of positively influencing the course of the disease increase,  says Andr  Fischer, research group leader and spokesperson at the DZNE site in G ttingen and professor at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at UMG.  We need tests that ideally respond before the onset of dementia and reliably estimate the risk of later disease. In other words, tests that give an early warning. We are confident that our current study results pave the way for such tests. Molecular SignatureThe biomarker that Fischer and his colleagues have found is based on measuring so-called microRNAs in the blood. MicroRNAs are molecules with regulatory properties: they influence the production of proteins and thus a key process in the metabolism of every living being.  There are many different microRNAs and each of them can regulate entire networks of interdependent proteins and thus influence complex processes in the organism. So, microRNAs have a broad impact. We wanted to find out whether there are specific microRNAs whose presence in the blood correlates with mental fitness,  Fischer says.Through extensive studies in humans, mice and cell cultures, the researchers ultimately identified three microRNAs whose levels were associated with mental performance. For this, they analyzed data from both young, cognitively normal individuals and from elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For the data from healthy individuals, the G ttingen scientists cooperated with Munich University Hospital. The data from MCI patients came from a DZNE study that has been running for years and involves university clinics throughout Germany.Omens of DementiaIn the end, the various findings came together like pieces of a puzzle: In healthy individuals, levels of microRNAs correlated with mental fitness. The lower the blood level, the better the subjects performed in cognition tests. In mice, in turn, this score increased even before the rodents started to show mental decline   regardless of whether this was due to age or because they developed symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer s dementia. Further evidence came from patients with MCI: Of those in whom the blood marker was highly elevated, about 90 percent developed Alzheimer s disease within two years.  We therefore see an increased blood level of these three microRNAs as a harbinger of dementia,  Fischer says.  We estimate that in humans this biomarker indicates a development that is about two to five years in the future. Potential Targets for TherapyIn their studies on mice and cell cultures, the researchers also found that the three identified microRNAs influence inflammatory processes in the brain and  neuroplasticity  which includes the ability of neurons to establish connections with each other. This suggests that the three microRNAs are more than warning signals.  In our view, they are not only markers, but also have an active impact on pathological processes. This makes them potential targets for therapy,  Fischer says.  Indeed, we see in mice that learning ability improves when these microRNAs are blocked with drugs. We ve observed this in mice with age-related mental deficits, as well as in mice with brain damage similar to that occurring in Alzheimer s disease. Application in Routine CareThe novel marker still requires further testing; moreover, the current measurement procedure is too complex for practical use:  In further studies, we aim to validate this biomarker clinically. In addition, we intend to develop a simple test procedure for point-of-care screening,  says Fischer.  Our goal is to have a low-cost test, similar to the rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 with the difference that for our purposes, you would need a drop of blood. Such a test could be used during routine checkups in doctors  practices to detect an elevates risk of dementia early on. Individuals with suspicious results could then undergo more elaborate diagnostics. Reference: Islam MR, Kaurani L, Berulava T, et al.

This process leads to the death of brain cells and leaves the patient with a sudden loss of certain body functions.Tissue plasminogen activator, also known as tPA, is the lone pharmacological treatment for stroke, and while it is considered to be highly effective, it comes with one important, and often hard-to-meet caveat: it must be administered to the patient within 3-5 hours of stroke onset. Though many other significant efforts have been undertaken to discover and develop new drugs, there have been no new therapeutics approved to treat stroke since tPA was approved in 1996.However, some recent advances in understanding signaling pathways that are relevant to the brain s self-protective mechanisms have allowed investigators to identify novel targets for further study. One of those investigators, Vardan Karamyan, Ph.D., from the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) Jerry H. Hodge School of Pharmacy, has researched and collaborated with others to develop an effective treatment for stroke that focuses on the use of a peptidase known as neurolysin (Nln). Peptidases are enzymes that have the ability to cleave, or split peptides, which often leads to their inactivation.Karamyan s most recent collaborative study is a continuation of his previous work and evaluates the potential of Nln as a therapeutic target for stroke by seeking to identify small molecules capable of enhancing the activity and catalytic efficiency of Nln.In previous research, Karamyan s lab first identified Nln as a key internal peptidase that helps protect the brain during acute neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke. His research showed that when Nln was inhibited after a stroke, there was more damage to the brain. However, when the amounts of Nln in the brain were increased prior to stroke, the damage was significantly reduced.When this also proved true in animal models, Karamyan and his team began to wonder if there were ways in which the activity of Nln already present in the brain could be enhanced, which based on previous experiments, should result in smaller stroke injury. While it looked good on paper, Karamyan knew from experience that enhancing the activity of enzymes is difficult to achieve. We have been very good   and when I say we, the research community   to inhibit enzymes, which means to block their function, block their activity,  Karamyan explained.  But it is extremely rare to have compounds which can enhance the activity of enzymes, to help them function with more efficiency. Over the last many decades, we learned pretty well how to inhibit enzymes, but when it comes to enhancing their activity, or activating them, our understanding is in its infancy. Further research completed and published this summer by the Karamyan research team and University of Florida collaborator David Ostrov, Ph.D., discovered two histidine dipeptides that can selectively enhance the activity of neurolysin ( Identification and Characterization of Two Structurally Related Dipeptides that Enhance Catalytic Efficiency of Neurolysin,  published Aug. 13 in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics).  We screened tens of thousands of compounds in the computer and we ranked them based on the probability that they could interact with neurolysin,  Karamyan summarized.  Then from those, we actually received the top 100 compounds from the NIH, and then in my lab we tested them one by one to see if we could then find compounds that do interact with neurolysin, but more importantly, enhance its activity. And we did that. Knowing this, Karamyan said the next logical step was determining how to work with these neurolysin histidine dipeptide activators to potentially improve stroke outcomes. While it is a very big deal to have such activator molecules, when it comes to using them therapeutically, unfortunately they are at a very big disadvantage because peptides usually are not good drugs; they are degraded when we take them into our body,  Karamyan said.Because the target organ is the brain, Karamyan said investigating whether or not any of the peptide activators could get past the blood brain barrier, which serves as a shield between the brain and the rest of the body. Its role is to prevent toxins and other substances from reaching the brain. Unfortunately, it also makes it difficult for some drugs to reach the brain.To address these issues, the Karamyan lab collaborated with the Abbruscato lab, which specializes in the blood brain barrier, and the Trippier lab, whose specialty is medicinal chemistry. Whenever Karamyan s lab identified a molecule with the potential to react with Nln, they passed it along to the Trippier lab. They are able to modify chemical molecules to make them better in regards to drug-like properties, because not every substance can be a drug,  Karamyan said.  We want them to be non-toxic, we want them to reach the target and we want them to do the job that we want for the duration that we want and then disappear without leaving any bad consequences. And that is what Paul's team can do. Each time Trippier modified a molecule, Karamyan s lab would make sure the molecule still was able to activate the neurolysin, or enhance its activity, while remaining stable. Whenever a potential molecule was confirmed, it was then sent to the Abbruscato lab for testing and evaluation as to whether or not the modified molecule had the ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier.  We took those dipeptides, and with all three groups collaborating together, we tried to devise and to develop better molecules that are high in potency, meaning you need less of this compound to enhance the activity of neurolysin,  Karamyan said.  They are more stable, and they have a better chance of getting to the brain. And that's what we reported in the JMC article.  While the study identified three molecules that exhibited significant improvements when compared to those original dipeptides, Karamyan said it would take more time to produce a molecule, and therefore a drug that is so effective and stable that it can be administered orally, intravenously or intramuscularly and can then reach the brain and activate neurolysin.Karamyan said what he and his collaborators have accomplished to this point represents a tremendous advancement in regards to what was known about neurolysin as an enzyme and in identifying molecules that could one day be used to treat stroke and other neurological disorders. However, they still have not reached the point where they can say they have a drug candidate that has worked in animals and is ready to be tested in humans. And it is not really surprising because hundreds of laboratories for probably four or five decades have tried to cure stroke, meaning if it was easy, it would have been done already,  Karamyan added.  That's our dream; that's our goal, but we're not there yet. Reference: Rahman MdS, Kumari S, Esfahani SH, et al.

The COVID-19 Delta variant s rapid spread in Singapore and globally underlines the need for rapid identification of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. While wastewater testing is a reliable indicator of the presence of virus in sewage discharge, the retrospective nature of this approach means pre-emptive action is not possible. The findings, described in a study published in Indoor Air on 14 Sept, indicate the potential for an airborne surveillance system that monitors for the presence of the virus and provides early warning of infection risks, which would be especially valuable in hospitals and nursing homes, and in enclosed places where large numbers of people congregate, said the research team. Professor Paul Tambyah, deputy director of NUS Medicine s Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme and President of Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said  The results of this air sampling study are encouraging, with the potential for the simple monitoring for the presence of COVID-19 in possible hotspots. This will allow for timely intervention where necessary to prevent the emergence of clusters. Hopefully this will prove useful as the country gradually transitions into recognising that the disease has become endemic and everyone learns to live as normally as possible with the virus.  Dr Irvan Luhung, SCELSE senior research fellow and study co-lead author, said  This study demonstrated the versatility and sensitivity of air sampling for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings, something that was previously not thought possible due to the high ventilation rate of hospital wards. Such an air surveillance capability could make a valuable contribution towards keeping frontline medical staff safe in this pandemic. In hospitals with a high daily number of COVID-19 patients, employing a routine air surveillance programme with high sensitivity could be beneficial in detecting the virus early and help to keep frontline medical staff safe.  Associate Professor David Allen from NUS Medicine s Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme and an infectious diseases clinician at the National University Health System (NUHS), said  The paper s findings expand our knowledge of the extent to which the virus may potentially be transmitted in different types of wards   this impacts safety and needed precautions for health care workers. The findings also advance the potential use of different methods of detecting virus in the environment to provide additional tools for mass screening (other methods are screening each person, sampling sewage, etc)   in our case a device which samples the air for the presence of virus.  Professor Stephan Schuster, deputy centre director at SCELSE, and genomics professor at the School of Biological Sciences, NTU, and Associate Professor David Allen, led the joint study.In ventilated indoor settings with a large air change rate   an industry standard measurement that indicates how often the air in a room is replaced by outdoor air   it can be difficult to detect a viral agent in the air. For instance, the air change rate in an hospital isolation ward can be up to 14 times per hour. To overcome this challenge, the scientists deployed air sampling devices in combination with an ultra-low biomass analysis approach developed by the team from SCELSE at NTU. The analysis approach consists of a series of steps tailored for successful RNA extraction from air samples. The extracted RNA is subjected to real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-qPCR), which has the same sensitivity as the standard nasopharyngeal swab test to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the sample. Two types of hospital wards were tested between February and May 2020: a naturally ventilated, open-cohort ward and a mechanically ventilated isolation ward. Air sample collectors with varying flow rates were deployed for eight-hour periods in different areas in the ward, such as the PPE donning area in the open-cohort ward, the windowsill in the isolation ward, and the toilets of both wards. A total of 27 air samples were collected. Alongside the air samples, 73 surface swab samples from the patient care, staff, and toilet areas of the two ward types were collected and analysed for comparison. The chosen swab sites were not cleaned for at least eight hours prior to swabbing. The scientists found that their devices operating at the higher air sampling flowrate of 150L/ min (compared to the lower flowrate of 50L/min) improved the chances of successful airborne SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Among the samples collected by the high flowrate sample collectors, 72 per cent were found to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is in comparison to the surface swab samples, which showed a positive detection rate of 9.6 per cent. These results highlight the potential of air sampling as a tool to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, said the scientists. Future air surveillance studies will need to be tested in locations outside of hospital environments where mass gatherings occur for rapid and sensitive high throughput communal testing at the population level, said the research team.

The research appears Oct. 6 in a special issue of Nature highlighting studies that contribute to a cell census, or  parts list,  of the brain.The UC San Francisco papers shed light on how the developing cerebral cortex   the outermost layer of the brain, associated with high-level processing   develops its characteristic map, which is common across human beings and critical to our functioning. The work also validates a new approach for predicting what kinds of cells early human neurons may become and provides an expansive dataset for researchers working to clarify the links between brain development and psychiatric and neurological illnesses. Understanding how the human brain develops   how cells mature and connect across regions   remains a huge problem,  says Arnold Kriegstein, MD, PhD, a professor of Neurology and member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and former director for the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research.  Today there is a global effort to use new technology to understand the developing brain at a molecular and cellular level in a way that s never been possible before. Today there is a global effort to use new technology to understand the developing brain at a molecular and cellular level in a way that s never been possible before. ARNOLD KRIEGSTEIN, MD, PHD, UCSF PROFESSOR OF NEUROLOGY  Our new findings say it s a little bit of both,  Kriegstein said.Applying cutting-edge methodology, Kriegstein and his team analyzed the genetic expression profiles of hundreds of thousands of developing brain cells. They found that cells in the prefrontal cortex, an area in the front of the brain associated with cognition, and V1, a back-of-the-brain region important for vision, expressed genes linked to their respective regions at a very early stage. Developing cells between the two brain poles, however, took much longer to begin showing gene expression patterns that destined them to specific locations. What we see is that early on there are just two basic areas of the cerebral cortex that differ clearly   the front and the back,  says Kriegstein.  But later on, the areas in between start to become subdivided, possibly as ongoing interactions influence cellular identities in those areas. In other words, the unfolding organization of the cerebral cortex seems to kick off with a pre-determined protomap that establishes the brain s poles, but quickly switch to a protocortex model as cells in the middle help direct each other s identities.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have identified some metabolic processes that SARS-CoV-2 uses to attack lung tissue. The results could one day be used to treat COVID-19, and potentially for other viruses like the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and HIV-1.The corona pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has given rise to a serious and ongoing global health crisis. Most people who fall ill with the disease develop mild to moderate symptoms; however, patients with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity are at higher risk of serious illness.All viruses spread by  piggy-backing  on substances and processes that are vital to the cellular energy supply, the metabolic pathways, in an attacked body or other organisms.The observation studies that have been done on COVID-19 patients during the pandemic indicate a correlation between disease severity and metabolic disorder with high levels of lipids (fats) in the blood. At the same time, metabolism is a highly individual process and is affected over time by multiple factors, including age, sex, diet, and lifestyle.Metabolic pathwaysResearchers at Karolinska Institutet have now examined which parts of the cell s energy supply are especially important to SARS-CoV-2 and how they affect the severity of the disease.The covid virus is already known to use the metabolic pathway AKT/mTOR/HIF-1. The new study complements this understanding.The researchers have discovered that glycolysis and glutaminolysis are the metabolic pathways that the virus  prefers  when attacking the lungs.

The results, just published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology , suggest people who vape are using a product whose risks have yet to be fully determined and could be exposing themselves to chemicals with adverse health effects. ""Existing research that compared e-cigarettes with normal cigarettes found that cigarette contaminants are much lower in e-cigarettes. The problem is that e-cigarette aerosols contain other completely uncharacterized chemicals that might have health risks that we don't yet know about,"" said senior author Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor of environmental health and engineering at the Whiting School of Engineering and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""More and more young people are using these e-cigarettes and they need to know what they're being exposed to."" Previous studies of e-cigarettes have looked specifically for evidence of the hazardous chemicals found in traditional cigarettes. But here the researchers performed a nontargeted analysis to explore the full range of chemicals both in the vaping liquid and the aerosols. Prasse and his team were the first researchers to test vape samples with chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry, a chemical fingerprinting technique more commonly used to identify organic compounds in wastewater, food, and blood. Although it's possible to buy vaping products in hundreds of flavors, for consistency they tested only tobacco-flavored liquids sold by four popular brands Mi-Salt, Vuse, Juul, and Blu. They found thousands of unknown chemicals in the liquid, and the number of compounds increased significantly in the aerosol. Furthermore, they detected condensed hydrocarbon-like compounds, typically associated with combustion, which manufacturers say is not happening during vaping. In traditional cigarettes, the condensed hydrocarbons generated during combustion are toxic. ""One of the main ways electronic cigarettes have been marketed is that they operate at temperatures below combustion, which would make them safer than traditional smoking,"" said lead author Mina Tehrani, a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Public Health. ""Our study shows that this novel fingerprinting approach can be applied to assess whether combustion-like processes are going on."" The team found nearly 2,000 chemicals, the vast majority of which are unidentified. Of those the team could identify, six substances were potentially harmful, including three chemicals never previously found in e-cigarettes. Tehrani was particularly surprised to find the stimulant caffeine in two of the four products. Caffeine has previously been detected in e-cigarettes but only in the caffeine-oriented flavors like coffee and chocolate. ""That might be giving smokers an extra kick that is not disclosed,"" she said. ""We wonder if they are adding it intentionally."" Besides caffeine, the team found three industrial chemicals, a pesticide, and two flavorings linked with possible toxic effects and respiratory irritation. Prasse said he became interested in studying vaping products after his cousin, a former smoker, started vaping, insisting it was healthy. He plans to send that cousin this paper. ""People just need to know that they're inhaling a very complex mixture of chemicals when they vape. And for a lot of these compounds we have no idea what they actually are,"" Prasse said. ""I have a problem with how vaping is being marketed as more healthy than smoking cigarettes. In my opinion we are just not at the point when we can really say that."" Co-author Ana M. Rule, an expert in metals exposures from vaping with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says many young people who vape never smoked so they aren't making a healthier choice, only starting out with a risky one. ""There are millions of middle school and high school students vaping that would not otherwise think of smoking,"" she says.

The new method could provide an in-depth understanding of visual sensory processing in both health and disease in the near future.The visual sensory thalamus is a key region that connects the eyes with the cerebral cortex. It contains two major compartments. Symptoms of many diseases are associated with alterations in this region. So far, it has been very difficult to assess these two compartments in living humans, because they are tiny and located very deep inside the brain.This difficulty of investigating the visual sensory thalamus in detail has hampered the understanding of the function of visual sensory processing tremendously in the past. By coincidence, Christa M ller-Axt, Ph.D. student in the lab of neuroscientist Prof. Katharina von Kriegstein at TU Dresden, discovered structures that she thought might resemble the two visual sensory thalamus compartments in neuroimaging data. The neuroimaging data was unique because it had an unprecedented high spatial resolution obtained on a specialised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine at the MPI-CBS in Leipzig, where the group was researching developmental dyslexia. She followed up this discovery in a series of novel experiments involving analysis of high spatial resolution in-vivo and post-mortem MRI data as well as post-mortem histology and was soon sure to have discovered the two major compartments of the visual sensory thalamus.The results showed that the two major compartments of the visual sensory thalamus are characterised by different amounts of brain white matter (myelin). This information can be detected in novel MRI data and thus, can be used to investigate the two compartments of the visual sensory thalamus in living humans. The finding that we can display visual sensory thalamus compartments in living humans is fantastic, as it will be a great tool for understanding visual sensory processing both in health and disease in the near future , claims first author Christa M ller-Axt and explains,  Post-mortem studies in developmental dyslexia have shown that there are alterations specifically in one of the two compartments of the visual sensory thalamus. However, there are very few of these post-mortem studies, so it is difficult to say whether all dyslexics are characterised by these kind of visual sensory thalamus alterations. Also, post-mortem data cannot reveal anything about the functional impact of these alterations and their specific contribution to developmental dyslexia symptoms. Therefore, we expect that our novel in-vivo approach will be a great asset in facilitating research on the role of the visual sensory thalamus in developmental dyslexia.

Stem cell researchers at Lund University in Sweden have now found a previously overlooked part of our DNA, so-called non-coded DNA, that appears to contribute to a difference which, despite all our similarities, may explain why our brains work differently. The study is published in the journal Cell Stem Cell.The chimpanzee is our closest living relative in evolutionary terms and research suggests our kinship derives from a common ancestor. About five to six million years ago, our evolutionary paths separated, leading to the chimpanzee of today, and Homo Sapiens, humankind in the 21st century. In a new study, stem cell researchers at Lund examined what it is in our DNA that makes human and chimpanzee brains different   and they have found answers. Instead of studying living humans and chimpanzees, we used stem cells grown in a lab. The stem cells were reprogrammed from skin cells by our partners in Germany, the USA and Japan. Then we examined the stem cells that we had developed into brain cells , explains Johan Jakobsson, professor of neuroscience at Lund University, who led the study.Using the stem cells, the researchers specifically grew brain cells from humans and chimpanzees and compared the two cell types. The researchers then found that humans and chimpanzees use a part of their DNA in different ways, which appears to play a considerable role in the development of our brains. The part of our DNA identified as different was unexpected. It was a so-called structural variant of DNA that were previously called ""junk DNA"", a long repetitive DNA string which has long been deemed to have no function. Previously, researchers have looked for answers in the part of the DNA where the protein-producing genes are   which only makes up about two per cent of our entire DNA   and examined the proteins themselves to find examples of differences. The new findings thus indicate that the differences appear to lie outside the protein-coding genes in what has been labelled as ""junk DNA"", which was thought to have no function and which constitutes the majority of our DNA.  This suggests that the basis for the human brain s evolution are genetic mechanisms that are probably a lot more complex than previously thought, as it was supposed that the answer was in those two per cent of the genetic DNA. Our results indicate that what has been significant for the brain s development is instead perhaps hidden in the overlooked 98 per cent, which appears to be important. This is a surprising finding. The stem cell technique used by the researchers in Lund is revolutionary and has enabled this type of research. The technique was recognised by the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It was the Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka who discovered that specialised cells can be reprogrammed and developed into all types of body tissue. And in the Lund researchers  case, into brain cells. Without this technique, it would not have been possible to study the differences between humans and chimpanzees using ethically defensible methods.Why did the researchers want to investigate the difference between humans and chimpanzees? I believe that the brain is the key to understanding what it is that makes humans human. How did it come about that humans can use their brain in such a way that they can build societies, educate their children and develop advanced technology? It is fascinating! Johan Jakobsson believes that in the future the new findings may also contribute to genetically-based answers to questions about psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, a disorder that appears to be unique to humans. But there is a long way to go before we reach that point, as instead of carrying out further research on the two per cent of coded DNA, we may now be forced to delve deeper into all 100 per cent   a considerably more complicated task for research , he concludes.

Storing captured carbon dioxide underground and generating electricity from geothermal energy are two important technologies for reducing greenhouse gases,  says Takeshi Tsuji, lead author of the study published in Scientific Reports.  However, for further adoption of these technologies, we urgently need better monitoring tools to mitigate and respond to related risks such as leakage and induced earthquake activity.  Because of cost constraints, conventional seismic monitoring is typically performed at long time intervals. This gap between data means that rapid, unexpected changes in carbon dioxide or geothermal reservoirs can easily be missed. The new method developed by the research team uses a small seismic source that rotates a 17-kg off-centered weight to create vibrations for probing the ground. Based on a technique called distributed acoustic sensing, the vibrations are then detected at hundreds of points along a buried fiber-optic cable which can be tens of kilometers long by measuring changes in light passing through the fibers. Analyzing the signals, the researchers could identify changes in pore pressure the pressure of fluids within voids in the ground. In systems deployed in the field, such changes could indicate hazards such as leakage of carbon dioxide or changes in a geothermal reservoir.  With our newly developed source system, we can very accurately control the timing of the generation of continuous waveforms over a wide range of frequencies,  Tsuji explains.  Since we know exactly when they originated, we can stack multiple signals over time to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This allows us to use a small, comparatively weak source to continuously monitor a large area within a radius of 80 kilometers from the source at a relatively low cost.  To test the effectiveness of this new system, the researchers conducted field experiments at two sites: a geothermal field on the island of Kyushu, southwestern Japan, and a marine formation off Kamaishi in northeastern Japan. The results of these field experiments showed that the new system could identify changes in the signals of the monitored subsurface formations with greater than 99.99% accuracy. The detected signal changes represented changes in pore pressure associated with geothermal operations and rainfall.  Our study shows that, by combining our small seismic source with distributed acoustic sensing technology, multiple reservoirs can be monitored over an extensive area at the fraction of the cost of conventional systems,  says Tsuji.  By giving us the means to detect and respond more quickly to leaks and other hazards, the continuous monitoring our system enables will also help in gaining the public acceptance that is vital for advancing carbon capture and storage and geothermal energy development projects.

They initially performed an open-label study involving 83 cases, with subsequent results showing significant differences after surgical removal in stage 0 IA. Preoperative urine samples had a significantly higher chemotaxis index compared to postoperative samples in patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy volunteers.Dr. Hideshi Ishii from The Osaka University said, ""Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest diseases, with a five-year survival rate of 9%.""Similar to sniffer dogs, the use of Caenorhabditis elegans has been introduced as a new strategy for detecting cancer-associated scents during cancer screening.

New research led by scientists at Penn State and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) demonstrates how a protein isolated from bacteria can provide a more environmentally friendly way to extract these metals and to separate them from other metals and from each other. The method could eventually be scaled up to help develop a domestic supply of rare earth metals from industrial waste and electronics due to be recycled.  In order to meet the increasing demand for rare earth elements for use in emerging clean energy technologies, we need to address several challenges in the supply chain,  said Joseph Cotruvo Jr., assistant professor and Louis Martarano Career Development Professor of Chemistry at Penn State, a member of Penn State s Center for Critical Minerals, and co-corresponding authors of the study.  This includes improving the efficiency and alleviating the environmental burden of the extraction and separation processes for these metals. In this study, we demonstrate a promising new method using a natural protein that could be scaled up to extract and separate rare earth elements from low-grade sources, including industrial wastes.  Because the U.S. currently imports most of the rare earth elements it needs, a new focus has been placed on establishing a domestic supply from unconventional sources, including industrial waste from burning coal and mining other metals as well as electronic waste from cell phones and many other materials. These sources are vast but considered  low grade,  because the rare earths are mixed with many other metals and the amount of rare earths present is too low for traditional processes to work well. Furthermore, current methods for extraction and separation rely on harsh chemicals, are labor intensive, sometimes involve hundreds of steps, produce a high volume of waste, and are high cost. The new method takes advantage of a bacterial protein called lanmodulin, previously discovered by the research team, that is almost a billion times better at binding to rare earth elements than to other metals. A paper describing the process appears online October 8 in the journal ACS Central Science. The protein is first immobilized onto tiny beads within a column a vertical tube commonly used in industrial processes to which the liquid source material is added. The protein then binds to the rare earth elements in the sample, which allows only the rare earths to be retained in the column and the remaining liquid drained off. Then, by changing the conditions, for example by changing the acidity or adding additional ingredients, the metals unbind from the protein and can be drained and collected. By carefully changing the conditions in sequence, individual rare earth elements could be separated.  We first demonstrated that the method is exceptionally good at separating the rare earth elements from other metals, which is essential when dealing with low grade sources that are a hodgepodge of metals to start with,  said Cotruvo.  Even in a very complex solution where less than 0.1% of the metals are rare earths an exceedingly low amount we successfully extracted and then separated a grouping of the lighter rare earths from a grouping of the heavier rare earths in one step. This separation is an essential simplifying step because the rare earths have to be separated into individual elements to be incorporated into technologies.  The research team separated yttrium (Y) from neodymium (Nd) both abundant in primary rare earth deposits and coal byproducts with greater than 99% purity. They also separated neodymium from dysprosium (Dy) a crucial pairing that is common in electronic waste with greater than 99.9% purity in just one or two cycles, depending on the initial metal composition.  The high-purity of the recovered neodymium and dysprosium is comparable to other separation methods and was accomplished in as many or fewer steps without using harsh organic solvents,  said Ziye Dong, a postdoctoral researcher at LLNL and first author of the study.  Because the protein is able to be used for many cycles, it offers an attractive eco-friendly alternative to the methods currently used.  The researchers do not think their method will necessarily supplant the current liquid-liquid extraction process that is commonly used for high-volume production of lighter rare earth elements from high-grade sources. Instead, it will allow for efficient use of low-grade sources and especially for extraction and separation of the rarer and generally far more valuable heavy rare earths.  Other recent methods are capable of extracting rare earth elements from low-grade sources, but they typically stop at a  total  product that has all the rare earths lumped together, which has relatively little value and then needs to be funneled into more conventional schemes for further purification of individual rare earth elements,  said Dan Park, staff scientist at LLNL and co-corresponding author of the study.  The value is really in the production of individual rare earths and especially the heavier elements.   Our process is particularly convenient because these high-value metals can be purified off the column first,  added Cotruvo. The researchers plan to optimize the method so fewer cycles are required to obtain the highest-purity products and so it can be scaled up for industrial use.  If we can engineer derivatives of the lanmodulin protein with greater selectivity for specific elements, we could recover and separate all 17 rare earth elements in a relatively small number of steps, even from the most complex mixtures, and without any organic solvents or toxic chemicals, which would be a very big deal,  said Cotruvo.  Our work shows that this goal should be achievable. ReferenceDong Z, Mattocks JA, Deblonde GJ-P, et al.

That causes the pathway to be blocked, and as a result the brain cells gradually starts to die.Scientists and private companies are developing drugs that target another protein, but their efforts may prove inadequate for most patients, a new study at the University of Copenhagen suggests. Our research suggests that targeting the frontrunner for Parkinson s Disease drug development, the alpha-synuclein protein, may not be sufficient to cure the patients or alleviate their symptoms. Major considerations should instead be made towards resolving brain inflammation caused by dysfunctional interferon-beta receptor signaling,  explains Professor Shohreh Issazadeh-Navikas, principle investigator and corresponding author of the study.The alpha-synuclein protein have long been thought to be the toxic protein to get rid of in Parkinson s Disease. But the study conducted in mice now suggests it may only help the cases of the familiar form of Parkinson s Disease, encompassing few percent of all Parkinson s Disease cases, whereas the so-called sporadic form covers the rest of the cases. In the familiar form of Parkinson s Disease, the alpha-synuclein protein is produced two or three times more than needed, and the neurons cannot get rid of it, which builds up toxicity and thus causing the disease,  says Professor Issazadeh-Navikas. In our study, we investigated whether the absence of the alpha-synuclein protein in the mice would impact disease development for the other 95 percent of patients. We found that when we took away this protein, it made no impact on the clinical and pathological manifestation of disease mimicking sporadic form of Parkinson s Disease and its pathology,  she explains.Much of the preclinical research for Parkinson s Disease is conducted in animal models that either add the alpha-synuclein protein or express human mutations of the protein in order to replicate the pathology. According to the researchers, that have led to a general assumption that the alpha-synuclein causes the disease, which is likely not the case for most patients.Instead, they now hope to bring to attention the important role of the interferon-beta pathway signaling in sporadic Parkinson s Disease. Our study suggests that we should also consider brain inflammation and particularly activate fine-tuning of interferon-beta signaling as a potential target for drug development, since it seems as a lack of it or a dysfunction of it is enough to cause the disease in the first place. At the very least, we want to bring more attention to this, and suggest it as a future therapeutic target,  says first author and Ph.D.-student Erika Bianca Torres Villanueva from Issazadeh-Navikas Group.Reference: Villanueva EB, Tresse E, Liu Y, et al.

""People who inhale these spores can get sick with anthrax, which is often fatal."" From a biodefense standpoint, it is important to understand the diversity of environmental Bacilli that could become novel biothreats such as anthrax, added Kovac, who has extensive experience with the genomics of Bacilli. ""There are known examples among Bacillus cereus group bacteria where 'benign' environmental strains have acquired anthrax-causing capabilities,"" she said. ""We are interested in detecting and characterizing similar strains of Bacilli that have both the characteristics of known biothreats and harmless environmental microorganisms."" If emerging pathogens or biothreats are detected early on, they are more likely to be contained effectively to prevent a public health emergency, Kovac noted.

Juan Ianowski (PhD) and Julian Tam (MD) found that sodium transport is abnormal in lungs with CF. The researchers, affiliated with the Respiratory Research Centre, studied the swine model of CF and used a specialized microelectrode technique that allowed them to perform experiments with very high resolution. They discovered there is excessive sodium absorption in the small airways, a previously unstudied site in the body. A precise understanding of the cellular basis of CF lung disease is a prerequisite for the development of treatments such as gene therapy that have the potential to cure CF,  said Tam.  CFTR modulators, such as Trikafta, can improve life for about 90 per cent of patients. Our work is especially relevant to that 10 per cent of people with CF who cannot benefit from these medications. According to Cystic Fibrosis Canada, CF is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting Canadian children and young adults. There is presently no cure for the disorder that varies in symptoms from patient to patient, but mainly affects the lungs and digestive system. About one in every 3,600 children born in Canada has CF, which occurs when a person receives two copies of a defective gene   one from each parent.Ianowski has been working with Tam for about six years, and has been able to meet people with CF in his clinic. He said this adds a sense of purpose and desire to create applicable outcomes through the research he performs in the lab. In this context I get to know the patients by name and see their struggles,  Ianowski said.  Working with Julian has created a meaningful partnership and we can inform and strengthen each other s work.

Salk Research Professor Pamela Maher and Bill Raschke of Virogenics, Inc. will receive $4.5 million over two years from the National Institute of Aging to support the trial, and they expect the first doses to be administered to healthy volunteers in early 2022. In mice, CMS121 reverses signs of aging in the brain and prevents the memory loss associated with Alzheimer s disease. CMS121 is acting through a completely different pathway than most people have been looking at for Alzheimer s disease,  says Maher, head of Salk s Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory.  This drug could actually make a difference for someone with Alzheimer s disease. In 2006, Maher and colleagues first discovered that fisetin a natural chemical found in strawberries and other fruits and vegetables helped prevent cultured neurons from dying and boosted the memory of healthy mice. The team chemically altered the structure of fisetin and screened the new, related compounds for their ability to reverse the signs of aging in isolated brain cells. One of the synthesized fisetin derivatives CMS121 was even more effective than fisetin at slowing the degeneration of brain cells that occurs during aging.Since then, Maher s group has tested the ability of CMS121 to treat Alzheimer s in a variety of mouse models of the disease. While many experimental Alzheimer s drugs aim to directly target the amyloid-  protein that accumulates in the brains of people with the disease, CMS121 works by altering pathways related to inflammation and lipid synthesis.To move CMS121 toward commercial use, Maher partnered with San Diego-based biotech startup Virogenics, founded by Raschke, to carry out the extensive preclinical and Investigational New Drug (IND) studies required before compounds can be tested in humans. While many studies at this phase are funded by large pharmaceutical companies or rely on venture capital backing, Maher and Virogenics won a Small Business Technology Transfer Grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 2013 to support their studies on CMS121. Now the phase I trial of CMS121 is being funded by the National Institute on Aging. It s pretty amazing that we ve been able to see this drug from the lab all the way through to a phase I trial. It s also fairly unusual to do all of this entirely with support from the National Institutes of Health,  says Maher.  We re very proud that we ve taken such a distinct approach. In the upcoming phase I trial, 56 healthy volunteers will take varying doses of CMS121 or a placebo in a randomized, double-blind study. Maher expects the data collection from the trial to be complete by fall 2022.  We hope that everything looks safe at that point and we can move on to a phase 2 trial,  she says.The phase I clinical trial is being supported by the National Institute on Aging under Award Number R01AG074447.

However, not much was known about in vivo plasticity of them until now. Researchers have identified a subpopulation of MSCs that promote the healing of bone fractures and show an enhanced ability to differentiate into various cell types.MSCs are found in bone marrow, and are  multipotent , meaning that they can both renew themselves and develop into a variety of specialized cell types, such as bone, fat, and cartilage cells. The researchers had previously developed a mouse line that uses green fluorescent protein to highlight cells expressing a particular molecule known as CD73. Studies of the bone marrow in this mouse revealed that a subpopulation of MSCs expressed CD73, as well as the sinusoidal endothelial cells (sECs) that are part of the vascular system of the bone marrow.       The CD73-positive MSCs could be seen to proliferate more than the CD73- negative MSCs, and to have a higher potential to differentiate into different cell types, indicating that this group of MSCs may be particularly effective for bone repair. The researchers therefore went on to study the functions of these CD73-positive MSCs in fracture healing.As a fracture heals, it progresses through various stages. These include clotted blood forming at the fracture, which becomes replaced by a callus of fibrous tissues and cartilage, followed by formation of a hard bony callus. The bone is then remodeled, as regular bone replaces the hard callus and the bone returns to its usual shape. The generation of the callus is critically dependent on the recruitment of MSCs from the surrounding tissue and the bone marrow,  explains lead author Assistant Professor Kenichi Kimura.  Therefore, fracture healing models are helpful for exploring the cellular dynamics of MSC migration and differentiation during tissue regeneration. The team was able to observe the CD73-positive MSCs moving towards the site of the fracture and forming new cartilage and bone cells to heal the fracture. The CD73-positive sECs were also involved in the healing of the fracture, as they contributed to the process of  neovascularization , the formation of new blood vessels to support the healed bone.Finally, they went on to graft CD73-positive MSCs into the area of a fracture, which markedly enhanced the healing process compared with when they grafted into CD73-negative MSCs.Says Assistant Professor Kimura,  The identification of this subpopulation of MSCs could be of great benefit for regenerative medicine and the treatment of fractures.

Silicon-based solar cells remain the dominant first-generation product, making up 90 per cent of the market, but demand is high for cells that can be manufactured without their high prices and complexity,  Professor Shapter said. Among the next-generation technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention because of their high efficiency and ease of fabrication. The technology has undergone unprecedented rapid development in recent years. But the new generation of solar cells still have some drawbacks such as poor long-term stability, lead toxicity and high material costs. Professor Shapter said his team studied a nanomaterial that showed great promise in overcoming some of the new cell s drawbacks and used doping, a common method of modifying the new cell s nanomaterial, to enhance its electrical properties.The researchers found that the efficiency and thermal stability of the doped cells significantly outperformed those that were not doped. The PSCs that had doped cells showed a remarkable solar conversion efficiency that exceeded 21 per cent,  Professor Shapter said.Solar cell efficiency is the rate at which a solar panel transfers the sunlight into electricity, with the average silicon cell efficiency presently between 15 and 22 per cent. This gives us hope that solar energy can continue to develop and improve as one of the most effective renewable and sustainable energy technologies,  Professor Shapter said.The research involved collaboration with Professor Mohammad Nazeeruddin from  cole polytechnique f d rale de Lausanne in Switzerland.Associate Professor Yun Wang from Griffith University contributed modelling to understand the interaction between doped cell layers and materials used in light absorption. Our results explain how doped cells can greatly improve the energy conversion efficiency and lifetime of solar cells observed from the AIBN experiments,  Dr Wang said.Professor Shapter said the research was part of a global push towards advanced and sustainable solar cell technology.   Our research contributes to intensive efforts to develop various types of solar cells with the aim of realising efficient, stable and low-cost replacements for present silicon-based technology.

He said: Paint particles have often been an overlooked component of marine microplastics but this study shows that they are relatively abundant in the ocean. The presence of toxic metals like lead and copper pose additional risks to wildlife. The study is based around data gathered by the MBA s Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), which is fitted with silk meshes and towed in surface waters similar to the spaces occupied by marine mammals.Over the course of 2018, it was used to sample sea water right across the North Atlantic region, from the Arctic Ocean to Spain, and from the eastern United States to Sweden.More than 3,600 samples were collected during that time and flakes were reported in about 2.8% (102) of all silks analysed. That compares with fibres or strands being observed in 48.8% (1763) of silks over the same period.Paint flakes also appeared to be more densely distributed around the shelf seas of northwest Europe than in the open, or more remote, ocean environments.An analysis of the paint particles was carried out in labs at the University using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, with their chemical composition consistent with that found on the hulls and other painted components of ships mobilised in the Atlantic region.Dr Clare Ostle, the co-ordinator of the Pacific Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey at the MBA and co-author on the study, added: We now know that plastics are everywhere, and that most organisms are likely ingesting them, however there is less known about how harmful this ingestion might be. This study has highlighted that paint flakes are an abundant form of microplastic that should not be overlooked, particularly as some may have toxic properties.

Athletes involved in sports with a high-level of movement   like soccer, football, or baseball   often score higher on dynamic visual acuity tests than non-athletes,  said Dr. Kristine Dalton of Waterloo s School of Optometry & Vision Science.  Our research team wanted to investigate if action video gamers   who, like e-sport athletes, are regularly immersed in a dynamic, fast-paced 2-D video environment for large periods of time   would also show superior levels of dynamic visual acuity on par with athletes competing in physical sport. While visual acuity (clarity or sharpness of vision) is most often measured under static conditions during annual check-ups with an optometrist, research shows that testing dynamic visual acuity is a more effective measure of a person s ability to see moving objects clearly   a baseline skill necessary for success in physical and e-sports alike. Using a dynamic visual acuity skills-test designed and validated at the University of Waterloo, researchers discovered that while physical athletes score highly on dynamic visual acuity tests as expected, action video game players tested closer to non-athletes.  Ultimately, athletes showed a stronger ability to identify smaller moving targets, which suggests visual processing differences exist between them and our video game players,  said Alan Yee, a PhD candidate in vision science. All participants were matched based on their level of static visual acuity and refractive error, distinguishing dynamic visual acuity as the varying factor on their test performance.These findings are also important for sports vision training centres that have been exploring the idea of developing video game-based training programs to help athletes elevate their performance. Our findings show there is still a benefit to training in a 3-D environment,  said Dalton.  For athletes looking to develop stronger visual skills, the broader visual field and depth perception that come with physical training may be crucial to improving their dynamic visual acuity   and ultimately, their sport performance.

However, those with particularly extreme scores will be resistant to conventional treatment.Professor McNaughton says the biomarker is based on a theory that has been evolving for more than 50 years.It is an important break-through as current psychiatric diagnoses use symptoms (e.g. cough) not causes (e.g. SARS-CoV-2), so there are no clear targets for therapy, and current treatments, both drugs and psychological, have low response rates.The new biomarker can help develop new diagnostic tests and treatments for anxiety disorders, meaning patients will achieve remission faster and with a less hit-and-miss choice of treatments, he says. Our biomarker provides an immediate foundation for the development of new drugs and for diagnostic tests that could guide treatment choice and so improve response rates. In the longer term, the underlying theory of the research should also allow similar advances across the range of threat and stress-related disorders. This could represent a revolution in the application of theoretical neuroscience to psychiatry, and to the current trend to link psychopathology with personality theory. Better treatment for anxiety disorders will help reduce the burden on patients, their families, workplaces, and governments through reduced health costs, Professor McNaughton says.Reference: Shadli SM, Ando LC, McIntosh J, et al.

This condition not only puts a strain on the well-being of those affected, but it is also linked to a number of physiological diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and psychological disorders such as depression, one of the world's leading causes of disease burden (Global Burden of Disease Study, 2017).Therefore, effective methods are being sought to reduce everyday stress in the long term. One promising option is mindfulness training, in which participants train their cognitive and social skills, including attention, gratitude and compassion, through various meditation and behavioural exercises. Various studies have already shown that even healthy people feel less stressed after a typical eight-week training programme. Until now, however, it has been unclear how much the training actually contributes to reducing the constant burden of everyday stress. The problem with many previous studies on chronic stress is that the study participants were usually asked to self-assess their stress levels after the training. However, this self-reporting by means of questionnaires could have distorted the effects and made the results appear more positive than they actually were.The reason for such a bias: The participants knew they were training their mindfulness, and a reduction in stress levels was a desired effect of this training. This awareness alone has an impact on subsequent information. ""If you are asked whether you are stressed after a training session that is declared as stress-reducing, even addressing this question can distort the statements,"" explains Lara Puhlmann, doctoral student at MPI CBS and first author of the underlying publication, which has now appeared in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. Factors such as social desirability and placebo effects played a role here. Unlike pharmacological studies, for example, in which the study participants do not know whether they have actually received the active substance or not, so-called blinded studies are not possible in mental training. ""The participants know that they are ingesting the 'antidote',"" says Puhlmann. ""In mindfulness research, we are therefore increasingly using more objective, i.e. physiological, methods to measure the stress-reducing effect more precisely.""The concentration of cortisol in hair is considered a suitable measure of exposure to prolonged stress. Cortisol is a hormone that is released when we are confronted with an overwhelming challenge, for example. In that particular situation, it helps put our body on alert and mobilise energy to overcome the challenge. The longer the stress lasts, the longer an increased concentration of cortisol circulates around our body - and the more it accumulates in our hair. On average, hair grows one centimetre per month. To measure the study participants  stress levels during the 9-month training, the researchers, in cooperation with the working group of Clemens Kirschbaum at the University of Dresden, analysed the amount of cortisol every three months in the first three centimetres of hair, starting at the scalp.The mental training itself was developed as part of a large-scale longitudinal study on the effects of mental training, the ReSource project, led by Prof. Dr. Tania Singer, scientific director of the Social Neuroscience Research Group. This 9-month mental training programme consisted of three 3-month sessions, each designed to train a specific skill area using Western and Far Eastern mental exercises. The focus was either on the factors of attention and mindfulness, on socio-affective skills such as compassion and gratitude, or on so-called socio-cognitive skills, in particular the ability to take perspective on one's own and others' thoughts. Three groups of about 80 participants each completed the training modules in different order. The training lasted up to nine months, 30 minutes a day, six days a week.","Published: October 8, 2021"

Jackson finds that the perception of being heard by a listener plays a key role in whether a person stutters.The  talk-alone-effect the phenomenon in which people who stutter don t stutter when they are alone has been noted in anecdotal reports but until now, has not been supported by evidence.A new study in the Journal of Fluency Disorders, led by NYU Steinhardt Professor Eric S. Jackson explores the talk-alone-effect among people who stutter, and how social pressure and the perception of a listener may influence speech. In the article,  Adults who stutter do not stutter during private speech,"" the authors conclude that the talk-alone-effect is real and that the perception of being heard by a listener plays a key role in whether a person stutters. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that people who stutter don't stutter when talking alone, but this phenomenon has not been confirmed in the lab, mainly because it's difficult to create conditions in which people believe that they are truly alone,  says Jackson.The researchers evaluated 24 adults under five different conditions: conversational speech, reading aloud, private speech (in which participants were made to think no one was listening), repeating the private speech for two listeners, and spontaneous speech. With the exception of private speech, all conditions involved participants talking or reading to others.In the private speech condition, participants were left alone to complete a challenging computer programming task, which has been shown to elicit private speech in previous studies. Participants were also deceived into thinking that nobody was listening to them, and were told that people who talk out loud to themselves are more likely to perform better on the task.The private speech condition was the only condition in which instances of stuttering were non-existent.The study, including the methods of deception, was approved by the Institutional Review Board at NYU. All participants were informed of the deception component after its conclusion and consented to continuing the experiment. We developed a novel method to convince participants that they are alone that their speech wouldn't be heard by a listener and found that adult stutterers do not stutter under these conditions. I think this provides evidence that stuttering isn't just a ""speech"" problem, but that at its core there must be a strong social component,  Jackson says.According to Jackson, the presence or possibility of a listener introduces the possibility that the speaker will be evaluated socially. When a speaker is speaking privately, there is no social component, and therefore, the speaker is not concerned with perception or judgement.The authors outline future directions for research on stuttering and suggest that examining private speech in young children would offer significant insight into the stages at which social considerations begin to influence stuttering.Reference: Jackson ES, Miller LR, Warner HJ, Yaruss JS.

The results, published in Science Advances, allow researchers to better understand the evolutionary history and current control mechanisms of color vision. In 1989 when I began studying the evolution of vision, the textbooks said that light sensitivity and color differentiation all came from the same protein. Since then, our group identified color-sensitive proteins, mapped their evolution between species, and now understand their regulation,  said Emeritus Professor Yoshitaka Fukada from the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Science.As new color-sensitive cone cells grow in the eye, controlled patterns of gene activity mean that each cell differentiates and produces one type of protein specialized to detect a specific range of light wavelengths. The ancestor of all animals with a backbone could differentiate four different color wavelengths of light: near-ultraviolet, blue, green and red.Over millennia, some ancestor species lost the genes responsible for one or two of those color-detecting proteins. Sometimes, a descendant species eventually recreated a color-specific protein by duplicating, then mutating a remaining gene.Genome sequencing allows researchers to study the evolution of color vision genes while gene editing tools can reveal how those genes are regulated. Studying mice has allowed experts to understand how violet- and red-wavelength sensitivity are regulated, but mice evolved without the ability to differentiate the blue and green wavelengths. Lack of convenient gene editing tools meant regulation of blue and green color sensitivity remained unknown.In 2019, Fukada s research team, now led by Lecturer Daisuke Kojima, combined the relatively new gene editing tools and color vision studies in zebrafish, a species with all four color-sensitive proteins. Microscope images of normal zebrafish retinas, the light-sensitive membranes lining their eyeballs and connected to their brains by their optic nerves, show a vibrant arrangement of fluorescently labeled cone cells in a distinct pattern of violet-, green-, red-, blue-, red-, green- and violet-detecting cells.Researchers first identified three genes   six6b, six7, and foxq2   common only in species with all four color vision proteins. Then, they genetically modified zebrafish to reduce the activity of those genes.Previously (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812884116), the UTokyo researchers observed that reducing expression of six6b and six7   either in combination or individually   eliminated both blue and green vision in zebrafish. Zebrafish without blue and green vision had difficulty finding food, indicating the importance of full-color vision for their survival.It was their most recently published results that allowed researchers to understand how blue and green sensitivities are distinguished by different foxq2 activity. In cone cells that will detect blue light, six6b and six7 activate foxq2. Then foxq2 activates gene expression of the blue-sensitive protein and blocks expression of green-sensitive proteins. Retinas of zebrafish lacking normal foxq2 gene expression do not have cone cells sensitive to blue light, instead packing together a shorter pattern of violet-, green-, then two red-, green- and violet-detecting cone cells.The combination of molecular genetic studies in single species with comparative genomic studies of multiple species gives researchers additional confidence in their map of color vision regulation. In the long term, foundational biological studies like this on how color vision is possible may eventually be helpful in future attempts to cure colorblindness,  explained last author of the research publication, University of Tokyo Lecturer Daisuke Kojima.Reference: Ogawa Y, Shiraki T, Fukada Y, Kojima D.

Smaller than the width of a human hair, these tiny particles pose a big problem. Once inhaled, they pass directly from the nose up and into the brain, beyond the blood-brain barrier that normally protects the brain from dust or other invaders.  In a research letter published today in Alzheimer s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer s Association, the USC researchers described how their labs each independently reported indications of recent decreases in neurotoxicity (damage to the brain or nervous system caused by exposure to toxic substances) of PM2.5 air pollution in humans and mice.University Professor Caleb Finch and associate professor of gerontology and sociology Jennifer Ailshire, both with the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, focused on PM2.5 pollution. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to premature death, particularly in people with chronic heart or lung diseases.Ailshire s research, published earlier this year in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease, showed a strong association between cognitive deficits and air pollution among people with lower levels of education in 2004.Based on data from the nationwide Health and Retirement Study, her work showed that, when exposed to PM2.5, adults 65 and older who had fewer than eight years of education faced a greater risk of cognitive impairment. But one decade later, Ailshire found no such association for study participants.A likely factor was the reduction in PM2.5 over the prior decade, said Ailshire. Air quality data showed the average annual PM2.5 levels in the study participants  neighborhoods were 25% below 2004 levels.Notably in 2014, very few of the study participants lived in places with annual average PM2.5 that exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards. This further suggested that the improvements with cognitive decline were linked to a drop in exposure to high pollution among older adults. Improving air quality around the country has been a tremendous public health and environment policy success story. But there are signs of a reversal in these trends,  Ailshire said.  Pollution levels are creeping up again and there are increasingly more large fires, which generate a significant amount of air pollution in certain parts of the country. This gives me cause for concern about future trends in improving air quality. Finch s research on mice, published earlier this year in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease, also found evidence of lower neurotoxicity of air pollution over time.Finch and his research team have studied pollution levels at the same Los Angeles site and their effect on mouse brains since 2009. After 2017, the mice exposed to a tiny, nanoscale version of PM2.5 appeared healthier. Markedly, they showed sharp declines in several factors of neurotoxicity, including oxidative damage to cells and tissues.During the years that Finch s and Ailshire s studies were taking place, the composition of air pollution in the United States was also changing.From 2000 to 2020, PM2.5 levels declined nationwide by 41%, according to the EPA. In contrast, urban PM2.5 in Los Angeles declined only slightly from 2009 to 2019. While nationwide ozone levels decreased, Los Angeles County ozone reversed the prior trends by increasing after 2015.Finch and Ailshire emphasize that their findings cannot evaluate potential benefits of air pollution improvements to the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Although PM2.5 levels declined nationally from 2009 to 2016, the year-over-year increases that have been observed since 2017 show that improvements in air quality can be reversed, as they were in Los Angeles. Our findings underscore the importance of efforts to improve air quality as well as the continued importance of demographic and experimental evaluation of air pollution neurotoxicity,  Finch said.Finch and Jiu-Chiuan  J.C.  Chen, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, previously published a study using both human and animal data that showed brain aging processes worsened by air pollution may increase dementia risk. Their research indicated that older women who lived in locations with high levels of PM2.5 suffered memory loss and Alzheimer s-like brain shrinkage not seen in women living with cleaner air.Reference: Ailshire JA, Finch CE.

Our finding   from a sample of individuals from across mainland Britain who were all born in the same week in 1946   that carrying an APOE4 gene was associated with better visual memory may provide clues to why this gene variant is so common. Understanding why APOE4 might result in better memory, may also help us to understand why it also leads to increased risk for Alzheimer s disease. Our DNA code is the blueprint for our biology. It holds the information needed to make specific proteins, which allow our bodies to function. Sometimes the DNA code can contain changes that increase our likelihood of getting a disease. To date, scientists have found versions of at least 30 different genes that are associated with an altered risk of developing Alzheimer s disease, the most common cause of dementia.The most studied gene with the largest effect on our Alzheimer s risk is called APOE. Everyone has two copies of the APOE gene each of which can take three forms (E2, E3, E4). People who inherit one copy of the APOE E4 version (roughly one in four people) are around three times more likely to develop Alzheimer s disease, compared to people without this version of the gene. Those with two copies may be more than eight times more likely to develop Alzheimer s.Some evidence suggests that APOE4 might confer some advantages, explaining the survival of this gene in the population.The UCL team led by Dr Kirsty Lu and Professors Seb Crutch and Jonathan Schott worked with a unique group of nearly 400 volunteers, recruited from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) 1946 British Birth Cohort. They were all born in the same week in 1946 and did not have dementia.The team assessed the effects of the APOE4 risk gene, and b-amyloid   one of the hallmark Alzheimer s proteins   as measured by a PET brain scan, on visual working memory.Scientists used a computerised  What was where?  task designed by colleagues at Oxford University to measure volunteers  visual working memory. This task involved participants being shown one to three objects displayed on a screen in random locations, presented on a black background. Scientists asked participants to look at the objects and to try to remember their identities and locations.In 398 study participants who do not have memory and thinking problems, having the APOE4 gene and the presence of b-amyloid in the brain had opposing effects on object identification, with APOE4 predicting better recall and amyloid build-up predicting poorer recall. APOE4 carriers were also able to recall locations more precisely.The results, suggesting better visual working memory in those with APOE4, suggests that there are some benefits of this gene in the older age, and even when proteins associated with Alzheimer s disease are building up.Dr Kirsty Lu (Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology), first author on the study, said:  Previous evidence has suggested that the APOE4 gene is one of various genetic variants that cause harm late in life, but may confer benefits earlier in life, during or before reproductive years. Here we have found that APOE4 s benefits may in fact persist into old age, at the same time that the harms of Alzheimer s disease are beginning to develop. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, Director of Research at Alzheimer s Research UK, the study s funders, said:  Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of dementia and a combination of risk factors including our age, lifestyle, and genetics play a role in determining our individual risk. We know the APOE4 gene can increase our overall risk of developing Alzheimer s but having a copy doesn t mean people will definitely go on to develop the disease. This new research highlights that there is still a lot to be understood about these genes, their role in the development of Alzheimer s, and intriguingly what effects they may have beyond the disease. While this research may be of little comfort for those living with Alzheimer s, better understanding the most impactful Alzheimer s risk gene is crucial for building a more complete picture of the development of the disease. While we cannot change our age or genes, some research has found that even if you carry a risk gene, there are still things you can do to reduce your risk.

This protein can be targeted by drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating other cancers, and therefore could be a good target in MDS. The researchers are creating a clinical trial to test these drugs, known as MEK inhibitors and named for the proteins they inhibit to stop cancer.MDS is a rare blood cancer that has no effective treatments and a poor prognosis. The mutations investigated in this study, however, are also found in other cancers, which extends the possible applications of these findings. This is the first study to discover that the altered protein created by GNAS is increased in cells with these mutations in MDS, and this results in the activation of processes that would render the cancer cells vulnerable to the MEK inhibitors,  said co-senior author Eirini Papapetrou, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Oncological Sciences at The Tisch Cancer Institute.  The discovery that we can try to use MEK inhibitors in this cancer is also a first, and our findings also support future drug development to target GNAS, identified in this study. Papapetrou led the study with Gene Yeo, PhD, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine. The researchers generated models of the mutations using stem cells, in order to study them in a physiological genetic context. They then turned the engineered cells into hematopoietic progenitor cells which are the relevant cell type in blood cancers and performed splicing and RNA binding analyses. This work integrates isogenic models of disease with cutting-edge RNA-omics to converge onto a new target for MDS,  Yeo said.These analyses allowed the team to identify high-confidence targets and to identify the driver of the disease. The team showed that MDS cells from the model as well as cells from MDS patients with these mutations were sensitive to treatment with MEK inhibitors.Reference: Wheeler EC, Vora S, Mayer D, et al.

The cyclical interactions of clock proteins keep the biological rhythms of life in tune with the daily cycle of night and day, and this happens not only in humans and other complex animals but even in simple, single-celled organisms such as cyanobacteria.A team of scientists has now reconstituted the circadian clock of cyanobacteria in a test tube, enabling them to study rhythmic interactions of the clock proteins in real time and understand how these interactions enable the clock to exert control over gene expression. Researchers in three labs at UC Santa Cruz, UC Merced, and UC San Diego collaborated on the study, published October 8 in Science. Reconstituting a complicated biological process like the circadian clock from the ground up has really helped us learn how the clock proteins work together and will enable a much deeper understanding of circadian rhythms,  said Carrie Partch, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of the study.Partch noted that the molecular details of circadian clocks are remarkably similar from cyanobacteria to humans. Having a functioning clock that can be studied in the test tube ( in vitro ) instead of in living cells ( in vivo ) provides a powerful platform for exploring the clock s mechanisms and how it responds to changes. The team conducted experiments in living cells to confirm that their in vitro results are consistent with the way the clock operates in live cyanobacteria. These results were so surprising because it is common to have results in vitro that are somewhat inconsistent with what is observed in vivo. The interior of live cells is highly complex, in stark contrast to the much simpler conditions in vitro,  said Andy LiWang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Merced and a corresponding author of the paper.The new study builds on previous work by Japanese researchers, who in 2005 reconstituted the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, the basic 24-hour timekeeping loop of the clock. The oscillator consists of three related proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. In living cells, signals from the oscillator are transmitted through other proteins to control the expression of genes in a circadian cycle.The new in vitro clock includes, in addition to the oscillator proteins, two kinase proteins (SasA and CikA), whose activities are modified by interacting with the oscillator, as well as a DNA-binding protein (RpaA) and its DNA target. SasA and CikA respectively activate and deactivate RpaA such that it rhythmically binds and unbinds DNA,  LiWang explained.  In cyanobacteria, this rhythmic binding and unbinding at over 100 different sites in their genome activates and deactivates the expression of numerous genes important to health and survival. Using fluorescent labeling techniques, the researchers were able to track the interactions between all of these clock components as the whole system oscillates with a circadian rhythm for many days and even weeks. This system enabled the team to determine how SasA and CikA enhance the robustness of the oscillator, keeping it ticking under conditions in which the KaiABC proteins by themselves would stop oscillating.The researchers also used the in vitro system to explore the genetic origins of clock disruption in an arrhythmic strain of cyanobacteria. They identified a single mutation in the gene for RpaA that reduces the protein s DNA-binding efficiency. A single amino acid change in the transcription factor makes the cell lose the rhythm of gene expression, even though its clock is intact,  said coauthor Susan Golden, director of the Center for Circadian Biology at UC San Diego, of which Partch and LiWang are also members. The real beauty of this project is how the team drawn from three UC campuses came together to pool approaches toward answering how a cell can tell time,  she added.  The active collaboration extended well beyond the principal investigators, with the students and postdocs who were trained in different disciplines conferring among themselves to share genetics, structural biology, and biophysical data, explaining to one another the significance of their findings. The cross-discipline communication was as important to the success of the project as the impressive skills of the researchers. Reference: Chavan AG, Swan JA, Heisler J, et al.

This occurred in male mice and in female mice whose sex hormones were reduced by removing their ovaries, thus mimicking menopause. Postmenopausal women are well known to be at increased risk for obesity around their waist as well as at risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease.Inhibiting PDE9 did not cause these changes in female mice that had their ovaries, so female sex hormone status was important in the study. Currently, there isn t a pill that has been proven effective for treating severe obesity, yet such obesity is a global health problem that increases the risk of many other diseases,  says senior investigator David Kass, M.D., Abraham and Virginia Weiss Professor of Cardiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  What makes our findings exciting is that we found an oral medication that activates fat-burning in mice to reduce obesity and fat buildup in organs like the liver and heart that contribute to disease; this is new. This study follows work reported by the same laboratory in 2015 that first showed the PDE9 enzyme is present in the heart and contributes to heart disease triggered by high blood pressure. Blocking PDE9 increases the amount of a small molecule known as cyclic GMP, which in turn controls many aspects of cell function throughout the body. PDE9 is the enzyme cousin of another protein called PDE5, which also controls cyclic GMP and is blocked by drugs such as Viagra. Inhibitors of PDE9 are experimental, so there is no drug name yet. Based on these results, the investigators suspected PDE9 inhibition might improve cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), a constellation of common conditions including high blood pressure; high blood sugar, cholesterol and triglycerides; and excess body fat, particularly around the waist. CMS is considered a pandemic by medical experts and a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancers and COVID-19.  While PDE9 inhibitors remain experimental, they have been developed by several pharmaceutical companies and tested in humans for diseases such as Alzheimer s and sickle cell. The current mouse study used a PDE9 inhibitor made by Pfizer Inc. (PF-04447943) that was first tested for Alzheimer s disease, though eventually abandoned for this use. Between the two reported clinical trials, over 100 subjects received this drug, and it was found to be well tolerated with no serious adverse side effects. A different PDE9 inhibitor is now being tested for human heart failure.To test the effects of a PDE9 inhibitor on obesity and cardiometabolic syndrome, the researchers put mice on a high-fat diet that led to doubling their body weight, high blood lipids and diabetes after four months. A group of female mice had their ovaries surgically removed, and most of the mice also had a pressure stress applied to the heart to better mimic cardiometabolic syndrome. The mice were then assigned to receive either the PDE9 inhibitor or a placebo by mouth over the next six to eight weeks.In female mice without their ovaries (a model of postmenopause), the difference in median percent weight change between the drug and placebo groups was -27.5%, and in males it was -19.5%. Lean body mass was not altered in either group, nor was daily food consumption or physical activity. The PDE9 inhibitor lowered blood cholesterol and triglycerides, and reduced fat in the liver to levels found in mice fed a normal diet. The heart also improved with PDE9 inhibition, with ejection fraction (which measures the percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts) relatively higher by 7% 15% and heart mass (hypertrophy) rising 70% less compared with the placebo. An increase in heart mass is evidence of abnormal heart stress. However, having this lowered by the inhibitor indicates stress on the heart was reduced.The investigators found PDE9 inhibition produces these effects by activating a master regulator of fat metabolism known as PPARa. By stimulating PPARa, levels of genes for proteins that control fat uptake into cells and their use as fuel are broadly increased. When PPARa was blocked in cells or the whole animal, the effects from PDE9 inhibition on obesity and fat-burning were also lost. They found estrogen normally plays this role of PPARa on fat regulation in females, but when its levels fall like they do after menopause, PPARa becomes more important to regulate fat and so PDE9 inhibition has a greater effect. The finding that the experimental drug did not benefit female mice that had their ovaries shows that these sex hormones, particularly estrogen, had already achieved what inhibiting PDE9 does to stimulate fat-burning,  notes Sumita Mishra, the research associate who performed much of the work.  Menopause reduces sex hormone levels, and their control over fat metabolism then shifts to the protein regulated by PDE9, so the drug treatment is now effective. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 40% of people living in the U.S. are obese; and 43% of American women over the age of 60   long past menopause   are considered obese.Kass notes that if his lab s findings in mice apply to people, someone weighing 250 pounds could lose about 50 pounds with an oral PDE9 inhibitor without changing eating or exercise habits. I m not suggesting to be a couch potato and take a pill, but I suspect that combined with diet and exercise, the effects from PDE9 inhibition may be even greater,  says Kass. The next step would be testing in humans to see if PDE9 inhibitors produce similar effects in men and postmenopausal women. PDE9 inhibitors are already being studied in humans, so a clinical obesity study should not be that far away,  Kass says.Reference: Mishra S, Sadagopan N, Dunkerly-Eyring B, et al.

It follows that the most effective way to control it would be a drug that targets metastasis itself preventing cancer cells from breaking off the primary tumor, or reining in rogue cells before they spread throughout the body and seed secondary tumors.  Now, a new study identifies a small molecule that could, in the future, be administered alongside standard chemotherapies to stave off colorectal cancer metastasis. The research, published in Science Advances, demonstrated how the compound, named RGX-202, foils a key pathway that cancer cells rely upon to hoard energy, thereby killing them and shrinking tumors in mice.  The findings have already led to a clinical trial in humans and may eventually give rise to a novel therapy that increases survival rates for multiple gastrointestinal cancers.   Colorectal cancer is one of the top causes of cancer-related mortality,  says Rockefeller s Sohail Tavazoie, head of the Elizabeth and Vincent Meyer Laboratory of Systems Cancer Biology.

It is shaped like a wishbone, comprising two extremities that connect via a hinge. The hinge makes the first contact with DNA and is able to bind to it with assistance from a protein called Nipped-B-like protein, or NIPBL. Next, the arms of the cohesin protein fold, and the hinge is able to swing in a fashion that hands the DNA over to the protein's extremities, meaning that another binding site can attach to the DNA.The NIPBL protein maintains the contact between the arm's binding site and the DNA. In this way, the DNA is kept in place until cohesin's hinge can regain its original position, where it is available to grab another section of the DNA. Over repetitive cycles, this folds DNA into looped structures.The researchers liken this process to the folding of a climbing rope, whereby you extend one of your arms to grab a part of the rope that is further away and bring the rope to your second hand. This second hand keeps the rope gripped while you once again reach for a more distant part of the rope. In cells, the energy required for cohesin's folding task comes from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).Due to the small size of the cohesin protein and DNA, some of the team's model is based on indirect observations. Peters explains, ""More work will therefore be required to test our model. In this sense, our work has some resemblance to work in astrophysics, where conclusions about the universe are also based on indirect evidence."" ","Published: October 7, 2021"

The researchers found that while both a sense of purpose and cognitive function made memories easier to recall, only a sense of purpose bestowed the benefits of vividness and coherence.The study, which focused on memories related to the COVID-19 pandemic, was published in the journal Memory. Personal memories serve really important functions in everyday life,  said Angelina Sutin, a professor in the College of Medicine and the paper s lead author.  They help us to set goals, control emotions and build intimacy with others. We also know people with a greater sense of purpose perform better on objective memory tests, like remembering a list of words. We were interested in whether purpose was also associated with the quality of memories of important personal experiences because such qualities may be one reason why purpose is associated with better mental and physical health. Nearly 800 study participants reported on their sense of purpose and completed tasks that measured their cognitive processing speed in January and February 2020, before the ongoing coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. Researchers then measured participants  ability to retrieve and describe personal memories about the pandemic in July 2020, several months into the public health crisis.Participants with a stronger sense of purpose in life reported that their memories were more accessible, coherent and vivid than participants with less purpose. Those with a higher sense of purpose also reported many sensory details, spoke about their memories more from a first-person perspective and reported more positive feeling and less negative feeling when asked to retrieve a memory.The researchers also found that depressive symptoms had little effect on the ability to recall vivid details in memories, suggesting that the connection between life purpose and memory recall is not due to the fewer depressive symptoms among individuals higher in purpose.Purpose in life has been consistently associated with better episodic memory, such as the number of words retrieved correctly on a memory task. This latest research expands on those connections to memory by showing a correlation between purpose and the richness of personal memory. We chose to measure the ability to recall memories associated with the COVID-19 pandemic because the pandemic is an event that touched everyone, but there has been a wide range of experiences and reactions to it that should be apparent in memories,  said co-author Martina Luchetti, an assistant professor in the College of Medicine.Along with the association with better memory, previous research has found other numerous benefits connected with having a sense of purpose, from a lower risk of death to better physical and mental health. Memories help people to sustain their well-being, social connections and cognitive health,  said co-author Antonio Terracciano, a professor in the College of Medicine.  This research gives us more insight into the connections between a sense of purpose and the richness of personal memories. The vividness of those memories and how they fit into a coherent narrative may be one pathway through which purpose leads to these better outcomes.

But other than making people feel good, do these  mechanotherapies  actually improve healing after severe injury? According to a new study from researchers at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), the answer is  yes. Using a custom-designed robotic system to deliver consistent and tunable compressive forces to mice s leg muscles, the team found that this mechanical loading (ML) rapidly clears immune cells called neutrophils out of severely injured muscle tissue. This process also removed inflammatory cytokines released by neutrophils from the muscles, enhancing the process of muscle fiber regeneration. The research is published in Science Translational Medicine. Lots of people have been trying to study the beneficial effects of massage and other mechanotherapies on the body, but up to this point it hadn t been done in a systematic, reproducible way. Our work shows a very clear connection between mechanical stimulation and immune function. This has promise for regenerating a wide variety of tissues including bone, tendon, hair, and skin, and can also be used in patients with diseases that prevent the use of drug-based interventions,  said first author Bo Ri Seo, Ph.D., who is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of Core Faculty member Dave Mooney, Ph.D. at the Wyss Institute and SEAS.A more meticulous massage gunSeo and her coauthors started exploring the effects of mechanotherapy on injured tissues in mice several years ago, and found that it doubled the rate of muscle regeneration and reduced tissue scarring over the course of two weeks. Excited by the idea that mechanical stimulation alone can foster regeneration and enhance muscle function, the team decided to probe more deeply into exactly how that process worked in the body, and to figure out what parameters would maximize healing.They teamed up with soft robotics experts in the Harvard Biodesign Lab, led by Wyss Associate Faculty member Conor Walsh, Ph.D., to create a small device that used sensors and actuators to monitor and control the force applied to the limb of a mouse.   The device we created allows us to precisely control parameters like the amount and frequency of force applied, enabling a much more systematic approach to understanding tissue healing than would be possible with a manual approach,  said co-second author Christopher Payne, Ph.D., a former Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and the Harvard Biodesign Lab who is now a Robotics Engineer at Viam, Inc. Once the device was ready, the team experimented with applying force to mice s leg muscles via a soft silicone tip and used ultrasound to get a look at what happened to the tissue in response. They observed that the muscles experienced a strain of between 10-40%, confirming that the tissues were experiencing mechanical force. They also used those ultrasound imaging data to develop and validate a computational model that could predict the amount of tissue strain under different loading forces.They then applied consistent, repeated force to injured muscles for 14 days. While both treated and untreated muscles displayed a reduction in the amount of damaged muscle fibers, the reduction was more pronounced and the cross-sectional area of the fibers was larger in the treated muscle, indicating that treatment had led to greater repair and strength recovery. The greater the force applied during treatment, the stronger the injured muscles became, confirming that mechanotherapy improves muscle recovery after injury. But how?Evicting neutrophils to enhance regenerationTo answer that question, the scientists performed a detailed biological assessment, analyzing a wide range of inflammation-related factors called cytokines and chemokines in untreated vs. treated muscles. A subset of cytokines was dramatically lower in treated muscles after three days of mechanotherapy, and these cytokines are associated with the movement of immune cells called neutrophils, which play many roles in the inflammation process. Treated muscles also had fewer neutrophils in their tissue than untreated muscles, suggesting that the reduction in cytokines that attract them had caused the decrease in neutrophil infiltration.The team had a hunch that the force applied to the muscle by the mechanotherapy effectively squeezed the neutrophils and cytokines out of the injured tissue. They confirmed this theory by injecting fluorescent molecules into the muscles and observing that the movement of the molecules was more significant with force application, supporting the idea that it helped to flush out the muscle tissue.To pick apart what effect the neutrophils and their associated cytokines have on regenerating muscle fibers, the scientists performed in vitro studies in which they grew muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) in a medium in which neutrophils had previously been grown. They found that the number of MPCs increased, but the rate at which they differentiated (developed into other cell types) decreased, suggesting that neutrophil-secreted factors stimulate the growth of muscle cells, but the prolonged presence of those factors impairs the production of new muscle fibers. Neutrophils are known to kill and clear out pathogens and damaged tissue, but in this study we identified their direct impacts on muscle progenitor cell behaviors,  said co-second author Stephanie McNamara, a former Post-Graduate Fellow at the Wyss Institute who is now an M.D.-Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School (HMS).  While the inflammatory response is important for regeneration in the initial stages of healing, it is equally important that inflammation is quickly resolved to enable the regenerative processes to run its full course. Seo and her colleagues then turned back to their in vivo model and analyzed the types of muscle fibers in the treated vs. untreated mice 14 days after injury. They found that type IIX fibers were prevalent in healthy muscle and treated muscle, but untreated injured muscle contained smaller numbers of type IIX fibers and increased numbers of type IIA fibers. This difference explained the enlarged fiber size and greater force production of treated muscles, as IIX fibers produce more force than IIA fibers.Finally, the team homed in on the optimal amount of time for neutrophil presence in injured muscle by depleting neutrophils in the mice on the third day after injury. The treated mice s muscles showed larger fiber size and greater strength recovery than those in untreated mice, confirming that while neutrophils are necessary in the earliest stages of injury recovery, getting them out of the injury site early leads to improved muscle regeneration. These findings are remarkable because they indicate that we can influence the function of the body s immune system in a drug-free, non-invasive way,  said Walsh, who is also the Paul A. Maeder Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at SEAS and whose group is experienced in developing wearable technology for diagnosing and treating disease.  This provides great motivation for the development of external, mechanical interventions to help accelerate and improve muscle and tissue healing that have the potential to be rapidly translated to the clinic. The team is continuing to investigate this line of research with multiple projects in the lab. They plan to validate this mechanotherpeutic approach in larger animals, with the goal of being able to test its efficacy on humans. They also hope to test it on different types of injuries, age-related muscle loss, and muscle performance enhancement. The fields of mechanotherapy and immunotherapy rarely interact with each other, but this work is a testament to how crucial it is to consider both physical and biological elements when studying and working to improve human health,  said Mooney, who is the corresponding author of the paper and the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS. The idea that mechanics influence cell and tissue function was ridiculed until the last few decades, and while scientists have made great strides in establishing acceptance of this fact, we still know very little about how that process actually works at the organ level. This research has revealed a previously unknown type of interplay between mechanobiology and immunology that is critical for muscle tissue healing, in addition to describing a new form of mechanotherapy that potentially could be as potent as chemical or gene therapies, but much simpler and less invasive,  said Wyss Founding Director Don Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at (HMS) and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.Reference: Seo BR, Payne CJ, McNamara SL, et al.

A wiring diagram of the brain would be a powerful tool to understand diseases of connectivity,  said Yuchin Albert Pan, the Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund Eminent Research Scholar in Developmental Neuroscience at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC.  Autism spectrum disorder, for example, is characterized by a loss of long-distance connections and increase in local connections. Most neuropsychiatric disorders have connectivity aspects.  Although human brains are more complex, zebrafish brains share a common architecture as do all vertebrates. Determining the structure and function of cells called neurons and how they connect within the brain and between the brain and other structures such as the eye could provide clues to more precisely treat neurological diseases and eye injuries.In a study in today s Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, the scientists reported an improved, viral-based technique to trace brain connections between neurons in zebrafish using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which labels cells as it spreads across the synaptic connections between neurons that are functionally  wired  together.Until now, the use of viral vectors in zebrafish has been limited because the viruses, such as rabies or adeno-associated virus, often used by scientists to transfer molecules to cells in mammals, are not effective in fish. To overcome this limitation, Virginia Tech scientists tried and validated the use of VSV to trace connection patterns in neurons in zebrafish. The virus was engineered to label excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are connected via a nanoscopic structure called the synapse.Before this study, the researchers had been successful with the approach, but the improved, second-generation version of the technique used a mutant version of VSV that was less toxic and longer-lived in the cells, making visualization of the connected neurons and the analysis of that connectivity possible up to five days after infection. This is really exciting, because now we can not only record activity, but we also know something about the cell types involved, and how they connect,  said co-lead author Manxiu  Michelle  Ma, a neurophysiologist and formerly a postdoctoral research associate in the Pan lab.  The unique viral tracer benefits from reduced cytotoxicity, which enables the virus-infected neurons to maintain their cellular integrity and express a fluorescent indicator to reveal neuronal activity during visual stimulation. Furthermore, this technique can also define the neuron type, for example, if the neuron during a visual stimulus is an excitatory neuron or an inhibitory neuron.  Stanislav Kler, a virologist and co-lead author of the study who was also a postdoctoral research associate in the lab, said,  The connectivity patterns between most neuronal types are mostly unknown. This gap in knowledge underscores the critical need for effective neural circuit mapping tools. This will get us a step closer to understanding how the brain stores and processes information and how we can manipulate these circuits for better health.  The research is especially significant for vision research. To restore vision after diseases or injury that affect the eye itself including the cells in the eye that project to structures deep within the brain for subsequent processing of the visual world, the eye needs to connect to the right places in the brain,  said Pan, who is a member of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute s Center for Neurobiology Research.  The small size and translucency of larval zebrafish are a unique experimental system to investigate whole brain neural circuits. Scientists working on vision regeneration can now look at whether there is functional connectivity. Reference: Kler S, Ma M, Narayan S, Ahrens MB, Pan YA.

Cell biologists have known the basic functions of most of these structures, called organelles, for decades. The bean-shaped mitochondria make energy, for example, and lanky microtubules help cargo zip around the cell. But for all that scientists have learned about these miniature ecosystems, much remains unknown about how their parts all work together. Now, high-powered microscopy   plus a heavy dose of machine learning   is helping to change that. New computer algorithms can automatically identify some 30 different kinds of organelles and other structures in super high-resolution images of entire cells, a team of scientists at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Janelia Research Campus reports October 6, 2021 in the journal Nature. The detail in these images would be nearly impossible to parse by hand throughout the entire cell, says Aubrey Weigel, who led the Janelia Project Team, called COSEM (for Cell Organelle Segmentation in Electron Microscopy). The data for just one cell is made up of tens of thousands of images; tracing all a cell s organelles through that collection of pictures would take one person more than 60 years. But the new algorithms make it possible to map an entire cell in hours, rather than years.  By using machine learning to process the data, we felt we could revisit the canonical view of a cell,  Weigel says. In addition to two companion articles in Nature, Janelia scientists also released a data portal, OpenOrganelle, where anyone can access the datasets and tools they ve created.These resources are invaluable for scientists studying how organelles keep cells running, says Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, a senior group leader and interim head of Janelia s new 4D Cellular Physiology research area who is already using the data in her own research.  What we haven t really known is how different organelles and structures are arranged relative to each other   how they re touching and contacting each other, how much space they occupy,  she says. For the first time, those hidden relationships are visible.","Published: October 7, 2021"

This study provides the first empirical evidence that intelligent animals can struggle in captivity,  said Dr Mason, a professor in the Department of Integrative Biology. ""Our findings could help pet owners identify which species may be more challenging to cater for as pets, because of their welfare requirements  added one of the lead authors, Dr Emma Mellor from the University of Bristol.The study, also conducted by other researchers at University of Bristol and Utrecht University in the Netherlands, revealed for the first time that this issue can in particular hinder large-brained parrots  in confinement.Published recently in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the study highlights cognitive stimulation and foods that require more complicated physical handling as ways to improve care of birds. The researchers examined two main data sources. One was an early 1990s survey on captive breeding success involving more than 30,000 birds in the United States. The team also ran an online survey involving almost 1,400 pet parrots in 50 species for stereotypic behaviour: repetitive abnormal activity such as biting at cage bars, chewing or even pulling out feathers, and swaying, bouncing or route pacing in cages.  They looked at housing conditions, brain size-body weight ratios - a marker for intelligence - diets and other factors, and used a form of analysis that allows evolutionary biologists to tease out inherited traits that predispose species to risk.  They found that species whose natural diet involves nuts, seeds and tough-coated insects were more likely to pluck, chew or even eat their feathers.  Parrot species with relatively large brains were more at risk for all other forms of stereotypic behaviour.That finding suggests that owners need to ensure naturalistic diets rather than providing processed foods to pet birds. Wild parrots normally spend 40 to 75 per cent of their active time foraging.   Parrots may have evolved needs to crunch and manipulate with their beaks   even when their food is ready processed and presented in a bowl. Or they might need particular nutrients present in natural diets. We don t know which is the most important to feather-plucking birds. So ideally owners should provide naturalistic food items, intact so that parrots really have to break their way in and do extractive foraging for as they do in the wild, said Dr Mason. Cockatiels, Jandaya parakeets, and yellow-naped Amazons, for instance, typically thrive in domestic settings. But relatively large-brained parrots such as Nanday parakeets, monk parakeets and some cockatoos suffer more psychological welfare problems. These intelligent species are more invasive too  added Dr Mason,  which is another reason to treat them with extra care. Most parrots are highly social but are often housed alone, and sometimes in monotonous and predictable conditions.   Some species seem to adapt well to captivity, but maybe some should not be kept unless you have lots of time and creativity, explained Dr Mason. She urged owners to provide more stimulation to birds, including more naturalistic aviaries along with puzzles and other enrichment items.  She said:  Good parrot carers are doing this already. But if you re new to parrots, pick a species likely to thrive. Don t pick parrots that are not a good fit for your place and lifestyle.  About half of the world s estimated 100 million parrots live in captivity, most as pets in private homes. In the wild, more than 40 per cent of species are threatened or near threatened.  It s really important from a conservation point of view to have good parrot welfare. Reference: Mellor EL, McDonald Kinkaid HK, Mendl MT, Cuthill IC, van Zeeland YRA, Mason GJ.

Now, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev and Soroka University Medical Center researchers simulated in mice a sharp decline in physical activity by removing a voluntary running wheel, and assessed how diet composition affects the response. They found that while less energy was spent by the mice, the mice still ate similar amounts of food as when the running wheel was present, which resulted in weight gain. Moreover, diet composition determined changes in the oxidation rates of fat or carbohydrates (sugars)   the two major energy sources of our body - in response to the decline in physical activity.Their findings were just published in the peer-reviewed Physiological Reports, a journal of the American Physiological Society.The mice were divided into two groups: one was fed a low-fat (=high carbohydrate) diet and the other a high-fat diet for six days. Mice were placed in metabolic cages, which measure their activity, food consumption, the amount of oxygen they consume and carbon dioxide (CO2) they release (from which carbohydrate and fat oxidation can be assessed). During the first 3 days, mice had access to a voluntary running wheel. The mice in both groups used it extensively during their active (nighttime) cycle. After three days, the running wheel was removed. Over those next three days, exercise dropped by 50%.Prof. Assaf Rudich, Dr. Uri Yoel and their group members, Dr. Yulia Haim, Dr. Nikhil S. Bhandarkar and Ms. Rotem Lahav, discovered that the diet determined how much fat or carbohydrates were burned: With the running wheel in the cage, high fat diet mice burned mainly fat throughout the day, and carbohydrate burning decreased even more when their physical activity dropped. The reverse was true for the low-fat (high carbohydrate) mice, who consumed during their wake hours more carbohydrates, and decreased burning fat even further when the running wheel was taken out of the cage.""Our findings show that there are immediate effects of exercise stoppage. While the comparison to human beings forced to become more sedentary during lockdowns requires confirmation in human clinical trials, our study provides a possible explanation as to how lockdowns may have induced weight gain: While the decline in spending energy is rapid, matching the lower energetic needs with lower food consumption takes time, resulting in a positive energy balance"", says Prof. Rudich.Dr. Uri Yoel, a clinical endocrinologist, adds:  Dietary composition determined the adaptation to less physical activity   the  rarer  energy source in the diet was the one that the mice chose to burn less of once the energy demand decreased. If also true in humans   this may have consequences on metabolism that need to be taken into consideration, particularly in persons with impaired metabolic regulation, such as diabetes.

The strategy could help researchers to improve stem cell transplantations and to find new treatments for metastasizing cancers.Many cells in the human body travel through blood vessels from one organ to another to carry out specific functions. For example, immune cells migrate to inflamed tissue and cancer cells spread to new organs. Stem cells also travel to new locations to develop into different tissues.  This stem cell 'homing,' where cells migrate to their new place of residence, is also essential for successful bone marrow transplantation for treating various diseases,  explains Satoshi Habuchi, who led the study.Homing is a multistep process in which cells slowly roll over the inner lining of blood vessels, then adhere to the lining once they reach the site they are destined for, and finally transmigrate across the vessel wall into the tissue.Scientists already knew that homing cells produce tethers containing ligands that can sense and bind to adhesion molecules on the blood vessel lining. Until now, however, scientists had not been able to directly visualize this rolling to understand exactly what happens at the molecular level.Satoshi, Merzaban and their teams were able to mimic cell rolling by using a microfluidic system.  The tethering and rolling step of homing had previously been described as a simple binding between selectins on the endothelium and their ligands on stem cells,  says Ph.D. student Bader Al Alwan.  Our findings demonstrated that the initial step of homing is far more dynamic and complicated. The team found that individual microvilli on the surface of the homing cells elongate to form individual tethers. Ligands in the microvilli rapidly extend throughout the tethers so they can  sniff out  selectin in the blood-vessel lining. Once located, the ligands bind to the selectins, attaching the tether to the vessel lining. This helps the cell resist the full strength of the blood flow. As the blood flow exerts pressure on the top of the cell, it rolls forward, stretching the tether until it reaches a critical point when it breaks and flips forward to come in front of the cell. Now called a sling, it is used to slow down the cell so that it can look for the molecules that signal where its new home is. When we started, we did not expect that cell morphology played such a critical role in stabilizing cell rolling,  says Al Alwan.  We were also surprised by the extent to which the morphology changes, with some tethers merging into multiple ones and others stretching to more than ten times the length of the cell. Our research is focused on understanding how various cells move in the body using adhesion systems. For example, one goal is to improve stem cell movement in the body so they can get where they are needed following transplantation or in other disease settings. We are also focused on understanding how and why cancer cells outperform normal cells in their ability to migrate so that we can develop methods to inhibit their metastasis. Using the sophisticated assays developed by Satoshi and his team, we also want to create a more precise map of the proteins that are present at each step of the homing and migration process to identify when and where they are important during migration,  says bioscientist Jasmeen Merzaban, the co-principal investigator of the study.Reference: Al Alwan B, AbuZineh K, Nozue S, et al.

An international team, including a researcher from the University of Washington, used modern tools to explain repeating patterns of stones that form in cold landscapes.The new study, published Oct. 5 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses experimental tools to show how needles of ice growing randomly on frozen ground can gradually move rocks into regular, repeating patterns. The team, based mainly in China and Japan, uses a combination of novel experiments and computer modeling to describe these striking features with new theoretical insights. The presence of these amazing patterns that develop without any intervention from humans is pretty striking in nature,  said co-author Bernard Hallet, a UW professor emeritus of Earth and space sciences and member of the Quaternary Research Center.  It s like a Japanese garden, but where is the gardener? Hallet specializes in studying the patterns that form in polar regions, high-mountain and other cold environments. One of the reasons for the patterns is needle ice. As the temperature drops, the moisture contained in the soil grows into spikes of ice crystals that protrude from the ground. When you go out in the backyard after a freezing night and you feel a little crunch under the foot, you re probably walking on needle ice,  Hallet said.As needle ice forms it tends to push up soil particles and, if there are any, small stones. More needle ice can form on patches of bare soil compared to rock-covered areas, Hallet said. The ice needles will slightly displace any remaining stones in the barer region. Over years, the stones begin to cluster in groups, leaving the bare patches essentially stone-free. That kind of selective growth involves interesting feedbacks between the size of the stones, the moisture in the soil and the growth of the ice needles,  Hallet said.Hallet had previously reviewed another scientific paper by first author Anyuan Li, formerly at Shaoxing University and now at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. The two began a collaboration that mixes Hallet s longtime expertise investigating patterns in nature with Li and his collaborators  background in experimental science and computer modeling.Senior author Quan-Xing Liu at East China Normal University uses fieldwork and lab experiments to understand self-organized patterns in nature. For this study, the experimental setup was a flat square of wet soil a little over 1 foot on each side (0.4 meters) that began with stones spaced uniformly on the surface. The researchers ran the experiment through 30 freeze-thaw cycles. By the end of that time, regular patterns had started to appear. The videos are pretty striking, and they show that the ice just comes up and in a single cycle it pushes up stones and moves them slightly to the side,  Hallet said.  Because of those experiments and the abilities of the individuals involved to analyze those results, we have much more tangible, quantitative descriptions of these features. Further experiments looked at how the pattern changed depending on the concentration of stones, the slope of the ground, and the height of the ice needles, which is also affected by the stone concentration. Based on those results, the authors wrote a computer model that predicts what patterns will appear depending on the concentration of stones on the frost-prone surface.Reference: Li A, Matsuoka N, Niu F, et al.

We have designed a special chemical catalyst, it can convert the greenhouse gas CO2 into the desired chemical fuels. The conversion efficiency can be controlled using a feasible approach,  Professor Kou said. It means we for the first time developed the abilities to speed up or slow down, even switch of the chemical reaction. Carbon dioxide is the main reason of global warming due to the greenhouse effect, to convert it into the chemical fuels is not only important for our environments, but also helpful to solve the energy crisis. Dr Ju, first author on the study, said the research work provided a guidance for the design of novel catalysts which could  produce significant impacts for the chemical industry.Professor Kou said the long-term goal in this area of research was to find ways to turning carbon dioxide into clean energy sources.Professor Kou said the results of this study could eventually lead to a way of adding a coating to engines or industrial systems that would convert carbon dioxide instead of releasing more of the gas into the atmosphere.Reference: Ju L, Tan X, Mao X, et al.

Dr. Josh Andersen, who heads the university's Fritz B. Burns Cancer Research Laboratory, discovered the mechanism by which a gene, called TNK1, becomes an oncogenic driver in cancer. TNK1 is present in all cells, but when mutated, it becomes dangerous and able to convert normal cells into cancer cells. This puts TNK1 in a select category of cancer driver genes.""You can think of cancer drivers as the engine that makes cancer grow and progress,"" said Andersen. Andersen and colleagues also figured out how mutations in the TNK1 gene cause cancer. It's a significant discovery considering only a handful of other drivers like TNK1 are known to scientists.""One of the greatest modern challenges of cancer research is identifying new cancer drivers because each one holds the key to a potentially much more effective cancer treatment,"" said Andersen.For years, Andersen has studied a cancer-promoting protein called 14-3-3 that exists at unusually high levels within cancer cells. Six years ago, he identified TNK1 as an interacting partner of 14-3-3. His research, along with the research of Dr. Jeff Tyner at Oregon Health Sciences University, has led to a greater understanding of TNK1 and how it acts as a cancer driver. Both Andersen, Tyner, and other scientists, including Drs. Ken Christensen and James Moody at BYU, jointly shared research and data in a recently published article in the scientific journal Nature Communications.After identifying TNK1 six years ago, Andersen and several Ph.D. students began working to understand its properties with the goal of designing and developing a new drug to treat tumors caused by TNK1.""Targeted therapy is the goal here,"" said Andersen. ""Being able to offer a cancer therapy that only targets the cancer driver the engine making cancer grow is going to help people live longer, healthier lives free from cancer. Targeted therapy holds the promise of being far more effective with fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy and is revolutionizing cancer treatment.""But developing drugs that target cancer tumors isn't easy to do; in fact, it might be the toughest task scientists face, especially in an academic setting. That didn't discourage Andersen or his students. Andersen contacted Dr. Steve Warner, Senior Vice President and Head of US Research at SDP Oncology   an international company that discovers and develops cancer remedies with a branch in Lehi, Utah   and asked him to help develop a drug to target TNK1.Warner, a BYU undergraduate classmate of Andersen's, was excited by the prospect of working together again.""Back when we were students at BYU, we became friends and connected through a common interest of both wanting to pursue additional schooling and careers in biomedical research,"" recalled Warner. ""We parted ways after BYU and did post-graduate work in different places, but ultimately we both found our way back to Utah. Working on this project to develop a drug for TNK1 was our first time working collaboratively together.""While it's never an easy process to develop a drug, the years of research and data Andersen shared with SDP Oncology gave their researchers a great place to start. SDP Oncology scientists started designing compounds that would target TNK1 in cancer cells. Through computer modeling and structure-based rational design, they continued to test and then optimize how this compound would react.""We didn't just design one drug and say, 'Here it is!',"" said Warner. ""Through trial and error, we would design and synthesize 20 or 30 potential candidate drugs and then evaluate those with different experiments in the lab. The results from those studies helped us understand how to improve the drug's interaction with TNK1 and how to balance the need to retain other properties required for a viable drug. We went through these iterative rounds of optimization until we identified a drug that we could move forward with.""The pre-clinical results for the drug, called TP-5801, are extremely promising and have both Andersen and Warner optimistic about future development.""We were very surprised how quickly we were able to find and optimize a development candidate for TNK1, which was enabled by the research Dr. Andersen had already done,"" said Warner. ""The pre-clinical data show that the drug is very promising with profound activity in models of cancer driven by TNK1.""The compound has passed FDA-required steps and is now ready for what's called a first-in-human study or phase 1 clinical trial.Current BYU Ph.D. student Chrissy Egbert and Ph.D. graduate, Dr. Tsz-Yin Chan, as well as a team of undergraduate researchers, worked on TNK1 alongside Andersen for the past six years and are thrilled to see their hard work published.""I started working on this project six years ago,"" said Chan. ""We almost gave up on this project after the first two years because we kept hitting dead ends. I'm so glad we tried some creative experiments and made a breakthrough.""Egbert says the opportunity to be involved with meaningful research during her graduate work was an experience she hadn't had before.""Prior to attending BYU, I had very little exposure to doing real and relevant research,"" said Egbert. ""It has been a really exciting experience to be a part of the TNK1 project, being able to uncover unknown information and connecting pieces to begin to understand TNK1 and its role in cancer has stretched my knowledge and abilities. I'm grateful for all of the opportunities that BYU has provided me during my Ph.D.""Reference: Chan T-Y, Egbert CM, Maxson JE, et al.

The researchers created the treatment by removing a common bacteria s ability to cause disease and repurposing it to attack harmful microbes instead.The experimental treatment was tested on infected catheters in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, successfully treating infections across all three testing methods. According to the authors, injecting the therapy under the skin of mice treated infections in 82% of the treated animals.The findings are an important first step for the development of new treatments for infections affecting medical implants such as catheters, pacemakers and prosthetic joints. These are highly resistant to antibiotics and account for 80% of all infections acquired in hospital settings.The study is published today in the journal Molecular Systems Biology. This work has been supported by the  la Caixa  Foundation through the CaixaResearch Health call, the European Research Council (ERC), the MycoSynVac project under the EU s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III.The new treatment specifically targets biofilms, colonies of bacterial cells that stick together on a surface. The surfaces of medical implants are ideal growing conditions for biofilms, where they form impenetrable structures that prevent antibiotics or the human immune system from destroying the bacteria embedded within. Biofilm-associated bacteria can be a thousand times more resistant to antibiotics than free-floating bacteria.Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common species of biofilm-associated bacteria. S. aureus infections do not respond to conventional antibiotics, requiring patients to surgically remove any infected medical implants. Alternative therapies include the use of antibodies or enzymes, but these are broad-spectrum treatments that are highly toxic for normal tissues and cells, causing undesired side effects.The authors of the study hypothesised that introducing living organisms that directly produce enzymes in the local vicinity of biofilms is a safer and cheaper way of treating infections. Bacteria are an ideal vector, as they have small genomes that can be modified using simple genetic manipulation.The researchers chose to engineer Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common species of bacteria that lacks a cell wall, making it easier to release the therapeutic molecules that fight infection while also assisting it in evading detection from the human immune system. Other advantages of using M. pneumoniae as a vector include its low risk of mutating new abilities, and its inability to transfer any of its modified genes to other microbes living nearby.M. pneumoniae was first modified so that it would not cause illness. Further tweaks made it produce two different enzymes that dissolve biofilms and attacks the cell walls of the bacteria embedded within. The researchers also modified the bacteria so that it secretes antimicrobial enzymes more efficiently.Reference: Garrido V, Pi ero-Lambea C, Rodriguez-Arce I, et al.

The modifications involve DNA methylation   binding of compounds known as methyl groups to DNA   which can alter a gene s activity. Some of the methylation changes associated with maternal depression occurred near genes involved in brain development, suggesting that maternal depression in pregnancy could have long-term implications for the mental development of the child.The study was conducted by Fasil Tekola-Ayele, Ph.D., of NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and colleagues. It appears in Epigenomics.The researchers undertook a genetic analysis, called an epigenome-wide association study, on samples of placentas delivered from 301 pregnant women who participated in a previous study. Study participants responded to questionnaires on their levels of stress and depression throughout their pregnancies. The researchers found that a history of stress was associated with methylation changes in two placental DNA sites and a history of depression was associated with changes in 16 placental DNA sites. Of the changes associated with depression, two were near genes linked to brain development.Previous studies have found associations between maternal depression in pregnancy and a higher risk for depression in children. The researchers called for long-term studies to determine whether epigenetic changes in the placenta associated with stress and depression can be used to predict children s mental health outcomes.Reference: Tesfaye M, Chatterjee S, Zeng X, Joseph P, Tekola-Ayele F.

Without a robust pain response, physical trauma could go unnoticed and untreated. Some people, however, experience chronic pain that lasts long after an injury has healed or has no easily identifiable cause.Unfortunately, treating chronic pain with over-the-counter and prescription medication has its own health risks, including adverse side effects and addiction. In the latest issue of Psychological Science in the Public Interest (PSPI), a team of researchers explores how psychological interventions can be part of a comprehensive plan to manage chronic pain while reducing the need for surgeries and potentially dangerous medications. There are several effective nonmedical treatments for chronic pain, and psychological treatments emerge among the strongest of these,  said Mary Driscoll, a researcher at Yale University and first author on the issue s main article.  People who engage in psychological treatments can expect to experience meaningful reductions in pain itself as well as improvements in physical functioning and emotional well-being. The PSPI report also addresses topics such as integrated pain care, or the blending of medical, psychological, and social aspects of health care; the future of pain treatment; and improving the availability and integration of pain-management strategies.Reference: Driscoll MA, Edwards RR, Becker WC, Kaptchuk TJ, Kerns RD.

The neuroscientists found that when activity in this brain region was suppressed, animals were more likely to seek safety and escape from perceived danger, whereas activation of vLGN neurons completely abolished escape responses to imminent threats.While it is normal to experience fear or anxiety in certain situations, we can adjust our fear responses depending on our knowledge or circumstances. For example, being woken up by loud blasts and bright lights nearby might evoke a fear reaction. But if you have experienced fireworks before, your knowledge will likely prevent such reactions and allow you to watch without fear. On the other hand, if you happen to be in a war zone, your fear reaction might be strongly increased.While many brain regions have previously been shown to be involved in processing perceived danger and mediating fear reactions, the mechanisms of how these reactions are controlled are still unclear. Such control is crucial since its impairment can lead to anxiety disorders such as phobias or post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), in which the circuits in the brain associated with fear and anxiety are thought to become overactive, leading to pathologically increased fear responses.The new study from the research group of Professor Sonja Hofer at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at University College London, took advantage of an established experimental paradigm in which mice escape to a shelter in response to an overhead expanding dark shadow. This looming stimulus simulates a predator moving towards the animal from above.The researchers found that the vLGN could control escape behaviour depending on the animal s knowledge gained through previous experience, and on its assessment of risk in its current environment. When mice were not expecting a threat and felt safe, the activity of a subset of inhibitory neurons in the vLGN was high, which in turn could inhibit threat reactions. In contrast, when mice expected danger, activity in these neurons was low, which made the animals more likely to escape and seek safety. We think the vLGN may be acting as an inhibitory gate that sets a threshold for the sensitivity to a potentially threatening stimulus depending on the animal s knowledge,  said Alex Fratzl, PhD student in the Hofer lab and first author of the paper.The next piece of the puzzle the researchers are focusing on is determining which other brain regions the vLGN interacts with to achieve this inhibitory control of defensive reactions. They have already identified one such brain region, the superior colliculus in the midbrain. We found that the vLGN specifically inhibits neurons in the superior colliculus that respond to visual threats and thereby specifically blocks the pathway in the brain that mediates reactions to such threats   something the animal sees that could pose a danger like an approaching predator,  said Sonja Hofer, Professor at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre and corresponding author on the paper.While humans do not have to worry much about predators, they also have instinctive fear reactions in certain situations. The hope is therefore, that clinical scientists may one day be able to ascertain if the corresponding brain circuits in humans have a similar function, with clinical implications for the treatment of PTSD and other anxiety-related disorders in the future.Reference: Fratzl A, Koltchev AM, Vissers N, et al.

The researchers found that the Norrie Disease Protein (NDP), which is lacking in patients with the rare disease, is essential for the maintenance and survival of hair cells in the cochlea, the cells responsible for hearing.They also found that a pathway believed to be vital for hair cell regeneration, known as the Wnt pathway, could mimic the effects of NDP by restoring hearing in deaf mice with Norrie Syndrome. This method and another technique that overexpressed NDP in nearby cells were both able to prevent and rescue hearing loss.The new discoveries, published in the September 28 issue of PNAS, may lead to promising treatment targets for the incurable disease and other forms of profound hearing loss.Norrie disease is an inherited disorder caused by more than 100 different mutations in the NDP gene that can lead to blindness, deafness and intellectual disability in males. While infants with Norrie disease are born blind, their hearing is typically normal at birth and progressively deteriorates to profound loss by an average age of 12 years. The hearing loss can be particularly devastating for the families with an affected child.Previously, researchers had thought that vascular issues caused by Norrie disease are what led to vision and hearing loss. However, the new findings suggest a lack of NDP is what causes hair cells to deteriorate and ultimately leads to deafness.By learning more about the role of this protein in hair cell loss, the researchers were able to target two pathways that effectively prevented and reversed hearing loss in mouse models with Norrie disease. Before, little had been understood about what causes children with Norrie disease to lose their hearing,  said Dr. Edge, a principal investigator in the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, and professor of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Through our research, we ve identified potential pathways for future treatments to prevent the hearing loss. These findings may also have implications for more common forms of permanent hearing loss.

The researchers concluded that this phenomenon is not unique to humans, with many male species of endotherms (birds and mammals) preferring a cooler temperature than the females.The researchers:  We propose that males and females feel temperature differently. This is a built-in evolutionary difference between the heat-sensing systems of the two sexes, which is related, among other things, to the reproduction process and caring for offspring. The study was led by Dr. Eran Levin and Dr. Tali Magory Cohen from the School of Zoology and the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History at Tel Aviv University, Yosef Kiat from the University of Haifa, and Dr. Haggai Sharon, a pain specialist from Tel Aviv University s Sackler Faculty of Medicine and the Tel Aviv Sourasky Tel Aviv Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital). The article was published in the Journal Global Ecology and Biogeography.The new study included an in-depth statistical and spatial analysis of the distribution of dozens of bird and bat species living in Israel, along with a comprehensive review of the international research literature on the subject. Dr. Levin, who among other things studies the physiology and behavior of bats, noted in his previous studies that during the breeding season males and females tend to segregate, with the males inhabiting cooler areas. For example, entire colonies in caves on the slopes of Mount Hermon are composed of only males during the breeding season, while in the warmer area of the Sea of Galilee there are mainly females, who give birth and raise their pups there. It was this phenomenon that aroused his curiosity.Moreover, a study of the research literature reveals several examples of a similar phenomenon being observed in many species of birds and mammals. In migratory bird species, males spend the winter in colder areas than females (it should be noted that in birds, the segregation between the sexes takes place outside of the breeding season, since the males participate in the raising of the chicks). Amongst many mammals, even in species that live in pairs or in mixed groups all their lives, the males prefer shade whereas the females prefer sunlight, or the males ascend to the peaks of mountains while the females remain in the valleys.Following the literature review, the researchers conducted their own research. They sampled information collected in Israel over the course of nearly 40 years (1981-2018) on thousands of birds from 13 migratory bird species from 76 sites (data from Birdlife Israel and the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History) and 18 species of bats from 53 sites (data from the researchers and the Society for the Protection of Nature.) In total, the study included more than 11,000 individual birds and bats, from Mount Hermon in the north to Eilat in the south.The reasoning behind the choice of birds and bats for the study is the fact that they fly and are therefore highly mobile, and the researchers hypothesized that the spatial separation between the sexes   sometimes extending to different climatic zones   would be particularly clear in these groups. Moreover, Israel's significant climate diversity allowed them to study individual animals of the same species that live in very different climatic conditions.The findings of the study clearly demonstrated that males prefer a lower temperature than females, and that this preference leads to a separation between the sexes at certain periods during the breeding cycles, when the males and females do not need, and may even interfere, with each other.Dr. Levin:  Our study has shown that the phenomenon is not unique to humans; among many species of birds and mammals, females prefer a warmer environment than males, and at certain times these preferences cause segregation between the two species. In light of the findings, and the fact that this is a widespread phenomenon, we have hypothesized that what we are dealing with is a difference between the females and males  heat-sensing mechanisms, which developed over the course of evolution. This difference is similar in its essence to the known differences between the pain sensations experienced by the two sexes, and is impacted by differences in the neural mechanisms responsible for the sensation and also by hormonal differences between males and females. Dr. Magory Cohen notes that this difference has a number of evolutionary explanations. First, the separation between males and females reduces competition over resources in the environment, and keeps away males who may be aggressive and endanger the babies. Furthermore, many female mammals must protect their offspring at a stage when they are not yet able to regulate their body temperature on their own, so they developed a preference for a relatively warm climate.Dr. Levin and Dr. Magory Cohen conclude,  The bottom line is, going back to the human realm, we can say that this difference in thermal sensation did not come about so that we could argue with our partners over the air conditioning, but rather the opposite: it is meant to make the couple take some distance from each other so that each individual can enjoy some peace and quiet. The phenomenon can also be linked to sociological phenomena observed in many animals and even in humans, in a mixed environment of females and males: females tend to have much more physical contact between themselves, whereas males maintain more distance and shy away from contact with each other.

The study changes the way we think about how the molecular machinery functions in basic cellular mechanisms during the development of organisms,  said Christine Rushlow, NYU professor of biology and the study s senior author.The nucleus is the portion of the cell containing the vast majority of genetic information including the complex jumble of long cables of DNA that make up the genome in order to determine the behavior of that organism. Genes stored in the sequence of DNA encode not just the protein sequence required to express the trait associated with that gene, but also the information for when that protein sequence should be manufactured. The nucleus is an elaborate switchboard the connection point for the vast array of information about the state of the cell s environment, which will be processed and responded to by a defined set of expressed protein products. Within this framework, our study asked if there exists cooperation between these hundreds of logic gates making individual decisions about when to manufacture their respective proteins,  said Peter Whitney, a PhD student in NYU s Department of Biology and one of the study s authors.Within the environment of the nucleus, it would make sense that genes regulated by the same type of information would be concentrated in close proximity so that they might share resources, potentially lowering the energetic cost of regulation. Several previous experiments have shown a level of organization in the nucleus where genes occupy discrete domains. However, many of these studies use biochemical methods to define domains, rather than actually observing the physical position of the active genes within the nucleus.In the Current Biology study, the researchers demonstrated that they could accurately identify the physical position of the active genes using a microscopy imaging procedure and fruit flies, a model organism commonly used in genetic and molecular research. The researchers examined how a fertilized fruit fly egg develops into a fully formed organism, a process that requires the activity of sets of genes, which become progressively activated during embryonic development.Focusing on the earliest set of genes appearing in 90-minute-old fruit fly embryos, the researchers observed how a protein called Zelda regulates the genes  transcription by recruiting the enzyme RNA Polymerase II (Pol-II). Using high resolution microscopy and antibody staining, they visualized Pol-II at sites of nascent transcription on chromosomes.By observing the positions of many genes using this method, they asked the question: Are genes found in clusters? The answer was no. We hypothesized that genes might share pools of Pol-II in regulatory hubs when they come into close proximity,  said Rushlow.  However, our data indicate that this is not the case, and genes in close proximity each have their own Pol-II pool. This was surprising, as it goes against conventional wisdom and appears to directly contradict results from other methods. The researchers performed a series of follow-up experiments to test the notion of functional clustering, such as looking for gene expression changes when genes were found in close proximity, or signs of resources being shared among the genes visualized. Once again, they did not find evidence of clustering.In contrast to the idea that genes are spatially clustered and share transcriptional resources what one might call a  collectivist  model the authors conclude that the data support an  individualist  model of gene control at early genome activation in fruit flies.Reference: Huang S-K, Whitney PH, Dutta S, Shvartsman SY, Rushlow CA.

Using the method, CO2 is transformed into structures called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), suggesting a new and simpler route to dispose of the greenhouse gas to help tackle global warming.The research was carried out by scientists at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), Kyoto University, and colleagues, and the results are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Taking the CO2 released from fossil fuel combustion and converting the gas into valuable chemicals and materials is a promising approach to protect the environment. But because CO2 is a very inert and stable molecule, it is difficult to get it to react using conventional conversion processes,  says Satoshi Horike, a chemist at iCeMS who led the study.  Our work demonstrates an easier approach that can be run at a much lower temperature and pressure. This should make reactions that use CO2 easier to produce and more popular. The Japanese team targeted MOFs because they have a wide range of uses, including as biosensors and catalysts. Further, because MOFs are porous and can hold large amounts of gas, they show promise as storage devices for sustainable hydrogen fuel.To run the reaction, the researchers bubbled CO2 at a temperature of 25 C and a pressure of 0.1 MPa through a solution with an organic molecule called piperazine, in what chemists call a  one pot  procedure. The MOF emerged quickly as a white microcrystalline powder that could be collected and dried. Analysis of its structure using X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the conversion had taken place as planned.The MOFs had a high surface area even though they were made from more than 30% CO2 by weight   properties that make them suitable as functional materials for many applications.The researchers now plan to see how they could use the reaction to convert CO2 directly from industrial fumes, such as those released by coal and gas-fired power stations. Direct utilization of CO2 is challenging, but it will potentially save a lot of energy that is required for the capture and separation of the gas,  Horike said.  The emission of CO2 by fossil fuel combustion must be reduced and regulated to protect the environment. Our method here is a potential clue to help solve some important environmental problems.

The abundance of SCFAs is often reduced in older patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease, the most common form of dementia. However, how this decline in SCFAs contributes to Alzheimer s disease progression remains largely unknown.Gut-derived SCFAs that travel through the blood to the brain can bind to and activate free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), a cell signaling molecule expressed on brain cells called neurons. Our study is the first to discover that stimulation of the FFAR2 sensing mechanism by these microbial metabolites (SCFAs) can be beneficial in protecting brain cells against toxic accumulation of the amyloid-beta (A ) protein associated with Alzheimer s disease,  said principal investigator Hariom Yadav, PhD, professor of neurosurgery and brain repair at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, where he directs the USF Center for Microbiome Research.One of the two hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer s disease is hardened deposits of A  that clump together between nerve cells to form amyloid protein plaques in the brain. The other is neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein inside brain cells. These pathologies contribute to the neuron loss and death that ultimately cause the onset of Alzheimer s, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of memory, thinking skills and other cognitive abilities.Dr. Yadav and his collaborators delve into molecular mechanisms to explain how interactions between the gut microbiome and the brain might influence brain health and age-related cognitive decline. In this study, Dr. Yadav said, the research team set out to uncover the  previously unknown  function of FFAR2 in the brain.The researchers first showed that inhibiting the FFAR2 receptor (thus blocking its ability to  sense  SCFAs in the environment outside the neuronal cell and transmit signaling inside the cell) contributes to the abnormal buildup of the A  protein causing neurotoxicity linked to Alzheimer s disease.Then, they performed large-scale virtual screening of more than 144,000 natural compounds to find potential candidates that could mimic the same beneficial effect of microbiota produced SCFAs in activating FFAR2 signaling. Identifying a natural compound alternative to SCFAs to optimally target the FFAR2 receptor on neurons is important, because cells in the gut and other organs consume most of these microbial metabolites before they reach the brain through blood circulation, Dr. Yadav noted.Dr. Yadav s team narrowed 15 leading compound candidates to the most potent one. Fenchol, a plant-derived compound that gives basil its aromatic scent, was best at binding to the FFAR s active site to stimulate its signaling.Further experiments in human neuronal cell cultures, as well as Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans (worm) and mouse models of Alzheimer s disease demonstrated that fenchol significantly reduced excess A  accumulation and death of neurons by stimulating FFAR2 signaling, the microbiome sensing mechanism. When the researchers more closely examined how fenchol modulates A -induced neurotoxicity, they found that the compound decreased senescent neuronal cells, also known as  zombie  cells, commonly found in brains with Alzheimer s disease.Zombie cells stop replicating and die a slow death. Meanwhile, Dr. Yadav said, they build up in diseased and aging organs, create a damaging inflammatory environment, and send stress or death signals to neighboring healthy cells, which eventually also change into harmful zombie cells or die. Fenchol actually affects the two related mechanisms of senescence and proteolysis,  Dr. Yadav said of the intriguing preclinical study finding.  It reduces the formation of half-dead zombie neuronal cells and also increases the degradation of (nonfunctioning) A , so that amyloid protein is cleared from the brain much faster. Before you start throwing lots of extra basil in your spaghetti sauce or anything else you eat to help stave off dementia, more research is needed   including in humans.In exploring fenchol as a possible approach for treating or preventing Alzheimer s pathology, the USF Health team will seek answers to several questions. A key one is whether fenchol consumed in basil itself would be more or less bioactive (effective) than isolating and administering the compound in a pill, Dr. Yadav said.  We also want to know whether a potent dose of either basil or fenchol would be a quicker way to get the compound into the brain. Reference: Razazan A, Karunakar P, Mishra SP, et al.

How such structures develop during embryonic development is a central question in biology. Physicists led by Erwin Frey (Professor of Statistical and Biological Physics at LMU Munich) and Andreas Bausch (Professor of Cellular Biophysics at the Technical University of Munich) investigated this fundamental problem using mini-organs termed organoids as their experimental system. The team focused on the spherical  alveoli  in which the ducts of the lactating mammary gland terminate. The study demonstrated in detail that these alveoli form according to the same principles as droplets in a jet of water emerging from a hose.The experimental work was carried out in Bausch s laboratory and used mammary-gland organoids grown in culture from excised human tissue. Organoids are three-dimensional model systems that exhibit many of the physiologically relevant properties of the organ from which they originated. Thus, mammary-gland organoids form ducts that branch into clusters of smaller tube-like structures, each of which ends in a spherical sac or alveolus. This architecture is typical of the lactating human mammary gland, but it is also found in many other organs including the lung. Bausch and his group succeeded for the first time in following the growth dynamics of the mini-organs over several days via time-lapse microscopy. In addition, they investigated the micromechanical response of the developing tissue to the localized, laser-induced ablation of cells.Using this strategy, the researchers were able to link the formation of the spherical alveoli to a change in the direction of movement of the cells in the developing tissue. The cells in each tubule are constantly in motion, pulling on their immediate neighbors. At first, they collectively migrate back and forth along the walls of the tubules.  But at some point, the cells at the tips of the tubules begin to follow a rotational course. This change in behavior, associated with the interactions between neighboring cells, then propagates posteriorly until all the cells near the tip of a branch begin to rotate as a collective,  says Andriy Goychuk, a member of Erwin Frey s research group and joint first author of the publication. His colleagues Pablo Fernandez and Benedikt Buchmann in Andreas Bausch s group, who performed the ablation experiments, explain what happens as follows.  The cells no longer exert the same force in all directions, which results in an alteration in their trajectories. While the cells that alternate between forward and backward movement exert more force in the direction of the axis of the tube than around its circumference, that is no longer the case for the cells that follow a rotational course. Thanks to the greater tensile stress along the circumference, the tip of each tube develops into a spherical protrusion. According to the authors, the mode of formation of the spherical protrusions is analogous to the mechanism that is responsible for the formation of drops in a water jet. Like the cells in the developing organoid, the surface of the water jet is under tension. All objects that are subjected to a tensile force try to minimize their surface. Since the surface area of a sphere is less than that of a cylinder, the water jet breaks up into discrete droplets   and in the mammary-gland tissue, the rotation of the leading cells alters the balance of forces in the tubular branches in such a way that they become unstable, as in the case of the water jet, and form spherical protrusions.  This theoretical model provides an important framework for the analysis of more complicated geometrical transformations in biological tissues   such as those that occur during the development of the salivary glands, the pancreas, the kidney and the lung,  says Frey.Reference: Fern ndez PA, Buchmann B, Goychuk A, et al.

By manipulating this gene in mice, researchers were able to activate an ancestral form of limb development seen in early tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates).In the limbs of all tetrapods, the bones on the hands and feet on the outside edge form first, known as postaxial development. The study focuses on salamanders, which are the only exception to this rule: their limb bones develop preaxially, or from the inside edge; the thumb before pinky. For more than 100 years, scientists have wondered if preaxial development evolved uniquely in salamanders,  said study co-author Randal Voss, Ph.D., University Research Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Director of the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center.  Now we understand that it s ancestral to the postaxial mode seen in all other tetrapods. Salamanders are not unusual, they simply retained the ancestral mechanism of vertebrate limb development. Voss, who studies salamanders  unique ability to regenerate body parts including limbs, teamed up with principal investigator Susan Mackem, M.D., Ph.D., with the National Cancer Institute s Center for Cancer Research, whose research focuses on the signaling networks involved in limb development.In both mice and axolotl salamanders, researchers manipulated the function of Gli3, a gene that is known to be important in regulating the pattern of limb development. Mice with excess GLi3 repressor activity reverted to preaxial limb development   just like salamanders. Conversely, when Gli3 was  knocked out  in salamanders, they developed limbs postaxially, like the mice and all other tetrapods. In evolutionary terms, what we d basically done in mice is bring back the ancestral form of limb development by gene manipulation, proving that Gli3 was key for the shift from preaxial development seen in early tetrapods,  said Voss.The results are significant to developmental and evolutionary biologists, including paleontologists that have recently identified fossils that support the idea that preaxial limb development is the ancestral mode of limb development in vertebrates. They also give insight on evolutionary questions about the transition from fins as vertebrates acquired limbs and moved onto land.In the future, findings from this work will also help answer questions about limb regeneration, Voss says. Salamanders are one of the few four-legged animals that can fully regenerate a limb after losing it and scientists have proposed the capability is linked to their retained preaxial development.Voss now plans to study limb regeneration in salamanders that his lab genetically manipulated for postaxial development.Reference: Trofka A, Huang B-L, Zhu J, et al.

The new research indicates that the molecule, called miR-766-5p, can significantly reduce levels of the oncogene MYC a specific gene that is expressed at high levels in tumor cells and helps fuel cancer growth and progression.At its most basic level, cancer is driven by abnormal and uncontrolled gene expression. Numerous different molecular mechanisms contribute to the activation and overexpression of oncogenes in cancer. MiRNAs work as negative regulators of gene expression. This means that they can directly bind and interact with certain gene messages and block them from being translated into a protein. Therefore, any molecular pathway controlled by that specific protein is also affected by this miRNA-mediated regulation. In a previous study, the TMDU group used cell culture experiments to demonstrate that treating cancer cells with miR-766-5p resulted in lower MYC expression and inhibited cancer cell growth rates. Following these intriguing findings, the group aimed to determine the specific mechanism behind these results.  MYC is a critical oncogene in many tumor types,  says lead author of the study Yasuyuki Gen.  It can promote cancer cell proliferation, can suppress the body s immune response to fighting the cancer, and can generally be the main driver of tumor progression in many patients. The researchers found that miR-766-5p could directly target and reduce expression of two proteins called CBP and BRD4. CBP can induce a molecular change called acetylation that causes DNA to become more  open , which allows genes present in that area to be more easily expressed. BRD4 can then be recruited to these sites and help promote transcription of these gene messages.   Areas of DNA with high activity of proteins like CBP and BRD4 are known as super-enhancers,  explains Johji Inazawa, senior author.  Many cancer cells develop super-enhancers near oncogenes, like MYC, that drive increased oncogene expression and therefore promote cancer. The team then experimentally treated cells with a synthetic version of miR-766-5p, finding that the resulting suppression of CBP and BRD4 caused decreased MYC levels in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Additionally, tumors that were engrafted in lab mice showed significantly suppressed growth when treated with miR-766-5p compared with a control miRNA. Our findings suggest that miR-766-5p-mediated control of CBP and BRD4 blocks formation of the super-enhancers that contribute to MYC overexpression in cancer cells,  explains Gen.In recent years, efforts have been made to develop specific miRNAs into targeted therapies for various cancers. This study provides considerable evidence that miR-766-5p could be used to fight MYC-driven cancers by targeting super-enhancers.Reference: Gen Y, Muramatsu T, Inoue J, Inazawa J. miR-766-5p targets super-enhancers by downregulating CBP and BRD4.

Rice University scientists had that in mind when they set out to improve their technique to make a common building block for drugs. Rice chemist Julian West and graduate student Yen-Chu Lu found that an Earth-abundant salt of manganese further simplifies the process of synthesizing fluoroketones, precursor molecules for drug design and manufacture.The complex method required catalysts of expensive silver until the West lab figured out how to replace it with a cerium-based compound. That in turn led the researchers to eye manganese as a next-level catalyst. The lab reported its results in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Catalysis. Attaching negatively charged fluorine atoms to ketones, biological compounds with a variety of structures, helps direct the functional groups toward desired reactions when used in anticancer and other compounds, West said. He noted in the previous study that replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorines  is like armor plating at that position  and helps drugs last longer in the body.Manganese has several advantages over cerium, West said, and not just for its easy availability and low cost.  The amount of product we got with cerium was good, but for it to work, we had to use as much cerium as starting material, said West, an assistant professor of chemistry.  With manganese, we required less than a 10th as much catalyst -- and more importantly, it just works better. We would rather use a trace amount of catalyst to save on material costs and to simplify purification. And while cerium was able to promote reactions with relative efficiency, it was essentially one-and-done. Cerium can be recycled for reuse as a catalyst but it requires a difficult reoxidization. That turned out to be much easier with manganese salts.  Yen-Chu found the reagent we use, Selectfluor, reoxidizes the manganese enough to react again and again,  he said.Manganese is also cheap enough that recycling the material may not be cost effective for manufacturers, West said. The only downside, he said, is that manganese-enabled reactions can take several hours to produce a batch of molecules as opposed to the half-hour or so needed by cerium. But even that limitation should prove no obstacle because of the relative cost, he said.  In our view, that s a fair tradeoff, because you re reducing the amount of reagents you need to add and getting more of the compound that you want,  West said. He said head-to-head comparisons with silver catalysts proved manganese delivered more product molecules with half the amount of catalyst.  So I think we re getting to state-of-the-art catalysis with this reaction. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (RR190025) and the Robert A. Welch Foundation (C-2085) supported the research.Reference: Lu Y-C, West JG. C C Bond fluorination via manganese catalysis.

We are really very excited, because these findings suggest we can repurpose approved anti-cancer drugs for use as treatments for Alzheimer s disease,  said Professor Wilf Jefferies, the study s senior author and principal investigator at the Centre for Blood Research, Vancouver Prostate Centre and Michael Smith Laboratories.  It could shorten the clinical development by years. Alzheimer s disease is estimated to affect 50 million people worldwide. The condition is characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss and dysfunctional changes in the brain.Potential Alzheimer s treatments have shown promise in animal models before, but failed in clinical trials. Typically, these strategies target a protein called tau or a protein fragment known as beta-amyloid, but the UBC researchers chose a different approach. They left the traditional targets alone and instead focused on curbing angiogenesis: the growth of new blood vessels. The vast majority of clinical trials have either directly or indirectly targeted beta-amyloid or tau,  said Prof. Jefferies.  Other than some controversial recent results, there's been a paucity of success in these clinical trials. So, a great deal of effort appears to have been directed toward the wrong targets for reversing Alzheimer's disease. Setting the stage for the present study, Prof. Jefferies  earlier pioneering work had shown that the proliferation of blood vessels compromises the blood-brain barrier in patients with Alzheimer s disease. This barrier, made largely of blood vessels, is believed to protect the brain from infection because foreign molecules cannot easily cross it.Since cancerous tumours also rely on new blood vessel growth to survive and thrive, the researchers reasoned that a proven anti-cancer drug might halt the process in Alzheimer s. Axitinib, the anti-cancer drug we used, blocks a receptor in the brain called a tyrosine kinase receptor, which is partly responsible for spurring blood vessel formation,  explained Dr. Chaahat Singh, the paper's first author and a postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. Jefferies.  It stops abnormal blood vessels from growing, which then prevents many downstream effects. By using Axitinib for just one month, the researchers dramatically reduced blood vessel growth, restored the blood-brain barrier, and most significantly, helped mice perform better on cognitive tests.In a typical test, a mouse is trained how to reach a reward through a maze. A healthy mouse can find its way back to the reward, while an animal with Alzheimer s disease symptoms cannot.The treatment has only been applied to mice thus far. Clinical trials will be needed to assess the effectiveness of this treatment in patients with Alzheimer s disease, as well as consideration for the long-term use of anti-cancer drugs in people living with Alzheimer s, who are mostly elders.Still, the researchers are optimistic. If Axitinib does work well in humans, repurposing an already-approved drug could more rapidly advance its use for Alzheimer s. Researchers including myself have been disappointed in observing numerous clinical trials for Alzheimer s disease fail to reach their clinical endpoints,  said Prof. Jefferies.  The therapeutic approach we discovered has an opportunity to revise the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's patients, which I think is absolutely needed at this point for the field to advance.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-insights-into-blood-vessel-formation-revealed-354400,New Insights Into Blood Vessel Formation Revealed A study of the genetic basis of blood vessel growth finds a surprise player helping cells ace this complex feat  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Growing blood vessels are experts at multitasking. Not only do cells in their walls divide, they must also sprout in new directions while learning to specialize, ultimately becoming part of vein, artery or lymphatic vessels. Prof. Karina Yaniv and her team at the Weizmann Institute of Science set out to learn how the cells juggle these multiple challenges, and they came up with surprising answers that may shed new light on cancer treatment, heart regeneration and other conditions involving blood vessel growth.Dr. Ayelet Jerafi-Vider, a former research student in Yaniv s lab in the Biological Regulation Department, together with Dr. Ivan Bassi, Noga Moshe and Yaara Tevet, decided to track cell division in the walls of growing blood vessels in transparent zebrafish embryos. To this end the scientists created transgenic fish in which the nuclei of endothelial cells   the cells that line the inner walls of blood and lymphatic vessels   lit up in changing colors: green when the cell was dividing, red when it was not. They were surprised to discover that whenever a cell started sprouting from the mother vessel, its nucleus was invariably red. This meant that cell division was temporarily suspended, apparently so as not to  distract  the cell while it was migrating. Only when the cell settled in the right spot did its nucleus turn green   that is, the cell then started dividing.Yet another surprising finding awaited the scientists when they checked which genes controlled blood vessel growth. As expected, they saw that a growth factor called VEGFC was prominently expressed when the cells began to sprout and migrate. But this growth factor triggered the expression of genes that temporarily blocked cell division, including the well-known tumor suppressor p53. The cell resumed its division when it entered areas in which VEGFC levels were lower, and consequently, so were the levels of p53. The p53 gene, sometimes referred to as  the guardian of the genome,  has been extensively investigated in cancer, but the current study exposed an entirely new role: an enabler of cell sprouting during blood vessel growth. We ve discovered a beautiful mechanism   the same growth factor that induces the sprouting also temporarily blocks the cell cycle, so the cell can sprout and migrate without busying itself with division, which is a complex and demanding process,  Yaniv explains.Next, the scientists forcibly stopped cell division in growing blood vessels with a drug that is commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. This resulted in the enhanced growth of blood vessels, which sprouted in a disordered fashion and did not specialize into distinct vessel types. Their messy tangles resembled the disordered blood vessel growth that often wraps around and penetrates cancerous tumors. Our findings suggest that certain chemotherapy drugs may be solving one problem   blocking the division of cancerous cells, but creating another   stimulating the growth of blood vessels that can support the tumor survival,  Yaniv says.  If this is indeed found to be the case in further studies, it might point toward possible new ways of making chemotherapy more effective. If this concern is validated by further research, it will need to be taken into consideration when designing cancer treatments, so as to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the wake of chemotherapy. On the other hand, understanding how exactly the growth of blood vessels is orchestrated and controlled may one day help enhance this growth when tissue needs to be regenerated or revived, for example, following a heart attack or stroke.Reference: Jerafi-Vider A, Bassi I, Moshe N, et al.

The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancers.Liquid biopsy provides an alternative to traditional biopsyThe prognosis of breast cancer has continued to improve in Western countries. In Finland, for example, almost 90% of breast cancer patients are alive after five years of their breast cancer diagnosis. However, there are significant differences in the prognosis of different subtypes of breast cancer, and breast cancer eventually recurs in approximately 20 30% of patients. Identifying patients with a poor prognosis from a large mass of patients earlier and more accurately than before is key to reducing breast cancer mortality.Liquid biopsy has been proposed as a possible tool for screening breast cancer patients with a poor prognosis. At its best, liquid biopsy utilising circulating markers released by cancer cells can give a more comprehensive picture of the cancer tumour. It can also help to identify characteristics of breast cancer that has a poor prognosis, which would be ignored by traditional analysis methods.High integrity of circulating DNA is associated with a poor prognosisThe study investigated the integrity of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in breast cancer patients, and the association of this integrity with breast cancer prognosis. High integrity was found to associate with a poor prognosis, and to be a prognostic factor independent of traditional prognostic factors,  says Maria Lamminaho, Lic. Med., the first author of the study. It has been known that the integrity of cfDNA is higher in breast cancer patients than in healthy controls or in patients with benign breast tumours,  says Hanna Peltonen, PhD, one of the authors. However, the association of cfDNA integrity with breast cancer prognosis has been studied considerably less, and our study provides much-needed additional evidence of the existence of this association,  Peltonen says.The study used extensive patient data from the Kuopio Breast Cancer Project (KBCP) launched in the 1990s, which enabled a more comprehensive analysis of patients' survival than previous studies. Patients in the KBCP have been monitored for almost three decades, which is an exceptionally long follow-up period even by international comparison. It also provides an excellent foundation for assessing patients' long-term survival prognosis,  Peltonen says.Towards a more accurate prognosis at an earlier stageThe findings are particularly interesting because the study focused on breast cancer patients whose prognosis was good when measured on traditional prognostic factors. For example, when analysing the cfDNA integrity of a group of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients   whose prognosis is generally considered to be good   the researchers were able to distinguish a group of patients whose prognosis was significantly worse than the rest of the group s. Our results show that together with traditional prognostic factors, measuring the integrity of cfDNA can in the future help us to identify breast cancer patients with a poor prognosis earlier and more accurately than before. This would allow patients requiring more intensive care to be placed under intensified care and monitoring earlier,  Professor Arto Mannermaa says.Reference: Lamminaho M, Kujala J, Peltonen H, Tengstr m M, Kosma V-M, Mannermaa A.

Being able to automate such detection skills could be useful in a range of settings, from airports to public buildings.Now, University of California San Diego chemists have developed a technology for monitoring the health of algae crops, one of world s most promising sources for sustainable products being developed to counter global issues stemming from fossil fuel pollutants and product waste.As described October 1 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a diverse group of researchers from undergraduates to senior faculty has collaborated in a Departmnt of Energy project to develop a real-time measurement technique that could save hundreds of millions of dollars in algae biomass losses. From new biologically based fuels that power vehicles to renewable plastics based on biodegradable polymers that eliminate waste in the oceans and overloaded landfills, algae are considered a key to a future of sustainable products. In order to have enough algae to supply all of these renewable materials biofuels, bioplastics and nutraceuticals we need to find ways to increase algae production and yield,  said Robert Pomeroy, the PNAS paper s senior author, of UC San Diego s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Pomeroy led the development of the technology with paper coauthor Ryan Simkovsky.  Keeping algae healthy is one way to do this. We can t afford to lose acres of these crops. The most economically competitive method of cultivating algae is to grow the tiny aquatic organisms in large-scale  raceway  ponds. Such open biomass production, however, leaves their growth vulnerable to contamination by a range of microscopic pond invaders. Infectious organisms that graze on algae include viruses, bacteria and fungi that can decimate algae crops in a matter of hours.The UC San Diego team developed a new method of assessing volatile gases, which are organic compounds often emitted by microbial processes. Using an instrument developed in UC San Diego Professor Kimberly Prather s lab, the researchers devised an automated way to perform real-time measurements of volatile gases using a technique known as chemical ionization mass spectrometry, or CIMS, a method previously used in medicine, defense and drug enforcement.The technology continuously monitors the normal health of algae by tracking their volatile gas emissions through their growth and bloom cycle. When invading organisms or predators attack and induce stress, this results in a change to volatile gas signatures. Using CIMS, the scientists showed they can instantly detect the disruption and alert algae cultivators to take action to save the harvest. If you knew there was an attack on the crop, from insects or bacteria, then you could either mitigate the damage or pull the plug and harvest before there s any damage done,  said Pomeroy, who works with chemist Mike Burkart and biologist Steve Mayfield iin the Food and Fuel for the 21st Century program. .  Bacteria are built to attack and eat the algae and their growth is exponential. You could be fine one day with nice green algae and the next day it s a brown muddy mess. So this is not like losing 10 percent of your wheat crop overnight you could lose the entire algae crop. The CIMS system, the researchers noted in their experiments, detected grazing contaminations by infectious organisms 37 to 76 hours earlier than traditional monitoring methods that have been used for years, including microscopy and fluorescence. More research will be conducted to further develop CIMS for algae field applications.Professor Prather is the founding director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for Aerosol Impacts on Chemistry of the Environment (CAICE), an NSF Center for Chemical Innovation. In CAICE, one of our main goals is to develop unique online analytical approaches to detect complex mixtures in biological and environmental systems,  said Prather.  This is an excellent example of how mass spectrometry that was developed for a different application, measuring gas phase ocean emissions, is now being used to address a problem of societal relevance. There are endless applications in the environmental and health fields for how these online mass spectrometry measurements can be used to tackle challenging problems. CIMS, the researchers indicate, could be adapted to monitor the health of other valued sources, including cheese, beer, monoclonal antibodies and certain laboratory-grown meats, all of which are susceptible to attacks from infectious organisms.Reference: Sauer JS, Simkovsky R, Moore AN, et al.

Certain aspects of perception, memory, and attention seem to be the most significantly affected, which can set the stage for dreadful accidents among the elderly. Luckily, various experimental protocols are being tested as potential ways to mitigate or even reverse age-related cognitive decline.One such protocol is called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This non-invasive procedure involves using electrodes to circulate small electrical currents through specific parts of the brain, modulating neuronal activity. While many studies have reported that tDCS can improve the cognitive capabilities of the elderly, it has proven difficult to rigorously quantify and compare these improvements between studies because of the different methodologies and experimental paradigms used.To help fill this knowledge gap, a team of scientists from Incheon National University, Korea, conducted a meta-analysis of previously published studies on tDCS as a technique to improve cognitive performance. Unlike existing meta-analyses, the researchers assessed the improvement produced by tDCS by comparing the changes in reaction time during various cognitive tasks. This essentially circumvented the problem posed by the large heterogeneity in the methodologies used for tDCS research. This paper was made available online on June 2nd, 2021, and was published in Volume 70 of Ageing Research Reviews in September 2021.After searching for and filtering relevant tDCS studies, the team ended up with 31 qualifying papers involving 934 healthy adults. They categorized the studies based on the cognitive domains targeted by the tasks given to the subjects, such as perceptual motor function, learning and memory, executive function, and language. Additionally, the researchers analyzed if the timing of the tDCS was relevant; that is, if applying tDCS before or during the tasks had different effects in reaction time.The results of the statistical analyses conducted by the team indicate that applying tDCS during the tasks produced a small yet significant improvement in reaction times, specifically in learning and memory tasks and executive function/complex attention tasks. This improvement was more pronounced in older people, suggesting the positive effects derived from tDCS increase with age.  Our meta-analysis extends prior findings that suggested tDCS protocols could improve cognitive functions and effectively increase cognition-related neural processing speed,  remarks Associate Professor Nyeonju Kang, who led the study.Overall, this study highlights tDCS as an effective therapeutic option for improving the lives of the elderly.  If we prove tDCS protocols effectively enhance cognitive functions, home-based tDCS programs could be developed to prevent the progression of age-related cognitive deficits, thereby increasing life satisfaction among the elderly population,  concludes Dr. Kang.Let us hope further research helps us understand the true potential of tDCS even better!Reference: Lee JH, Lee TL, Kang N.

The researchers found that one important population of BNST neurons is more excitable in female mice than in males, helping to account for female mice s greater susceptibility to binge drinking.The researchers also found that a distant cluster of neurons called the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), which is wired into the BNST, acts as a brake on its activity and has a stronger influence on the female BNST compared with the male BNST. Thus, the PVT is able to curb excessive alcohol consumption through this circuit brake in female mice but not males. While females may be offered more protection through this mechanism, they may also be more vulnerable to disease when this brake is disrupted. This study highlights that there are sex differences in the brain biology that controls alcohol drinking behaviors, and we really need to understand those differences if we re going to develop optimal treatments for alcohol use disorder,  said senior author Dr. Kristen Pleil, assistant professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine.Women tend to consume less alcohol than men do, but researchers believe that is due mostly to cultural factors, and in recent decades that gender gap has narrowed significantly, especially among younger women. Women may in fact have an inherently greater vulnerability to alcohol use disorders, for reasons that lie deep within mammalian biology. Females across mammalian species, compared to males, display greater binge drinking and progress from first alcohol use to disease states more quickly,  Dr. Pleil said.  But there has been hardly any research on the neural details that underlie this sex difference. For the study, she and her team showed that BNST neurons, whose activity enhances binge-drinking behavior in mice, are more excitable and likely to fire spontaneously in female mice compared to males, apparently due to greater stimulation from other brain regions wired into the BNST. This higher excitability in females means that more inhibition of the female BNST is needed to prevent or reduce binge-drinking behavior.The researchers found that the brain region with the densest projection to the BNST is the PVT which works as a natural inhibitor of BNST activity, more so in female mice. They found that reducing the strength of this PVT projection promotes binge alcohol drinking behavior in female mice, but not in male mice, whose BNST activity is lower to begin with.The results, Dr. Pleil said, indicate that although this BNST-driven stress response circuit is tuned to be more excitable in females, it is also more heavily regulated in females, perhaps as an adaptation for more female-specific behaviors.What behaviors? That is still unclear, although the researchers found that altering BNST activity via the PVT had no effect on the mice s intake of sweet-tasting sucrose suggesting that the PVT-BNST circuit, with its greater sensitivity and tighter regulation in females, evolved for something more specific than guiding general reward-seeking behaviors. Female mammals have a different set of goals compared to males, and may need to be more sensitive to different types of reward,  Dr. Pleil said.She added that sex differences in the PVT-BNST circuit may be relevant to sex differences not only in alcohol-use disorders but also in anxiety disorders which are much more common in women and frequently co-occur with binge drinking. The researchers found that enhancing PVT inhibition of the BNST led to reduced avoidance behaviors a proxy for reduced anxiety in humans in both male and female mice.Dr. Pleil and her laboratory now are investigating the upstream circuits that stimulate BNST activity, the role of estrogen, and the molecular characteristics of PVT and BNST neurons that might allow them to be targeted by future drug treatments for alcohol-use disorders.Reference: Levine OB, Skelly MJ, Miller JD, et al.

In spite of its high prevalence, there is no cure and we don t entirely know what brings it on. This is true of nearly all autoimmune diseases, which makes treating or preventing them so difficult,  said Dr. Ritu Chakravarti, an assistant professor in the UToledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences and the paper s lead author.  If we can successfully get this vaccine into the clinic, it would be revolutionary. Chakravarti has for years studied a protein called 14-3-3 zeta and its role in immune pathologies, including aortic aneurysms and interleukin-17  a cytokine associated with autoimmune diseases. Based on their prior work, the research group was focused on the protein as a potential trigger for rheumatoid arthritis.Instead, they found the opposite.Rather than preventing rheumatoid arthritis, researchers discovered that removing the protein through gene-editing technology caused severe early onset arthritis in animal models.Working under a new theory that the 14-3-3 zeta protein protects against rheumatoid arthritis, the team developed a protein-based vaccine using purified 14-3-3 zeta protein grown in a bacterial cell.They found the vaccine promoted a strong and immediate   but long-lasting   response from the body s innate immune system, providing protection against the disease. Much to our happy surprise, the rheumatoid arthritis totally disappeared in animals that received a vaccine,  Chakravarti said.  Sometimes there is no better way than serendipity. We happened to hit a wrong result, but it turned out to be the best result. Those kinds of scientific discoveries are very important in this field. In addition to suppressing the development of arthritis, the vaccine also significantly improved bone quality   a finding that suggests there should be long-term benefits following immunization.Currently, rheumatoid arthritis is treated primarily with corticosteroids, broad scale immunosuppressive drugs or newer, more targeted biologics that target a specific inflammatory process.While those therapeutics can alleviate pain and slow the progression of the disease, they also can make patients more vulnerable to infection and, in the case of biologics, can be costly. We have not made any really big discoveries toward treating or preventing rheumatoid arthritis in many years,  Chakravarti said.  Our approach is completely different. This is a vaccine-based strategy based on a novel target that we hope can treat or prevent rheumatoid arthritis. The potential here is huge. Researchers have filed for a patent on their discovery and are seeking pharmaceutical industry partners to support safety and toxicity studies in hopes of establishing a preclinical trial.Reference: Kim J, Chun K, McGowan J, et al. 14-3-3 : A suppressor of inflammatory arthritis.

In this joint study, health care workers at Ziv Medical Center, one of the main hospitals in northern Israel, regularly provided blood samples to measure their antibody levels following vaccination. A number of differences emerged following sample analysis of individuals infected pre- and post-vaccination, and those who were never infected.Previously infected individuals who received one dose of the vaccine had much higher IgG antibody levels than fully vaccinated workers who were never infected. However, infection after the first dose (and before the second) did not increase IgG levels, and individuals infected after the first dose who never received the second had similar antibody levels to those who received one dose and were never infected.  Individuals in the cohort infected post-vaccination had IgG antibody levels at 21 and 50 days similar to those never infected who received the same number of doses and much lower than those infected pre-vaccination.""Our study suggests that two doses of vaccine are needed in those who were infected shortly after the first dose,"" says epidemiologist Prof. Michael Edelstein, of Bar-Ilan University's Azrieli Faculty of Medicine. ""Although it was conducted on a small cohort, our data suggest that a second dose provides optimal protection to those patients infected between doses,"" he adds. Edelstein collaborated with Dr. Kamal Abu-Jabal, of Ziv Medical Center and the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, and a team of colleagues from the hospital and the medical school.The researchers stress that larger studies should confirm or refute the need for a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in these individuals, in particular in the context of emerging variants against which vaccines are less effective.The current findings build upon research published in February 2021 in the journal Eurosurveillance. In that study, on the same cohort of health care workers, the researchers reported evidence that those previously infected with the virus responded very strongly to one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, regardless of when they were infected and whether or not they had detectable antibodies against COVID-19 prior to receiving the vaccine.Prof. Edelstein and colleagues are continuing to follow the cohort's antibody response and immune system response, as well as the response to the third dose for those who receive it.Reference: Jabal KA, Ben-Amram H, Beiruti K, et al.

Researchers at Utrecht University found that the substances actively balance connections in the brain that allow cells to either activate or inhibit each other. The discovery reveals how brain cells influence each other, and how psychiatric disorders can arise when this process goes wrong.Although wisdom comes with age, our brain does not store every single experience or lesson learned. In addition to learning and remembering, our brains are also equipped to forget irrelevant things or drop unused skills. In order to find a balance in this, brain cells constantly communicate with each other through connections that activate or inhibit the cells. Researchers from Utrecht University discovered that brain cells can form new, inhibitory connections via so-called endocannabinoids. They announce their discovery in Journal of Neuroscience.CounterbalanceEndocannabinoids derive their name from the cannabis plant, which contains similar substances. The researchers discovered the role of endocannabinoids when they induced brain cells of mice to strengthen activating connections. In response, the brain cells also started making new inhibitory connections. The researchers found that endocannabinoids kickstarted the new connections.Surprisingly active roleThe researchers were surprised to find that these substances play such an active role. ""Nobody expected this from endocannabinoids,"" says research leader Corette Wierenga, neurobiologist at Utrecht University.It was already known that endocannabinoids can influence the functioning of our brains. But until now researchers assumed that the substances were merely involved in adjusting existing connections. ""Now it appears that the system of endocannabinoids can actively push the production of new inhibitory connections, with which brain cells actively regulate the balance.""Psychiatric disorders caused by imbalanceThe discovery could help scientists to better understand how psychiatric disorders and other abnormalities in the brain develop. In many of these disorders, the balance between inhibitory and activating connections is disturbed. During an epileptic seizure, for example, this balance is seriously disturbed. Although in many other disorders the disturbance is more subtle, for example in schizophrenia, the impact can still be equally profound.Unbalance caused by cannabisThe balance between activating and inhibiting connections in our brain is constantly being adjusted in response to our experiences. Whenever we experience something, the connections change, and the brain must restore the balance. Cannabis use can disrupt that balance.""Occasional cannabis use will not seriously disturb the balance,"" says Wierenga. ""But if the balance is disturbed for a longer period, it can cause problems. For example, children of mothers who smoked marijuana during pregnancy can experience problems with neurological development.""Early stages of lifeThe balance is especially important in early stages of life, Wierenga says. ""During our development, brain connections are constantly changing. Especially during that period, it is important that inhibitory and activating connections remain coordinated. If the coordination is malfunctioning or disturbed, you can imagine that the system becomes disrupted. And unfortunately, disruptions that occur so early cannot be easily repaired later in life.""Cell BiologyAccording to Wierenga, such disruptions can lead not only to loss of memory, but also initiate more serious consequences. For example, the brain might grow out to less adaptive to stressful situations. ""When this happens, things get out of hand more easily in the brain, because inhibition and activation are out of balance. That could lead to learning and behavioural problems.""Predicting and preventing disordersCreating a deeper understanding of the role endocannabinoids play in the brain, could lead to psychiatric disorders being more predictable or even prevented in the future. The publication in Journal of Neuroscience now sets out a new direction in which more knowledge can be built up. Wierenga: ""Ultimately, as a researcher, we want to understand how brain cells coordinate the balance and what happens when that balance is disturbed.""Reference: Liang J, Kruijssen DL, Verschuuren AC, et al.

Strong protection following natural infection is short-lived.  Reinfection can reasonably happen in three months or less,  said Jeffrey Townsend, the Elihu Professor of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health and a lead author of the study.  Therefore, those who have been naturally infected should get vaccinated. Previous infection alone can offer very little long-term protection against subsequent infections. The study, published in the journal The Lancet Microbe, is the first to determine the likelihood of reinfection following natural infection and without vaccination. Townsend and his team analyzed known reinfection and immunological data from the close viral relatives of SARS-CoV-2 that cause  common colds    along with immunological data from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Leveraging evolutionary principles, the team was able to model the risk of COVID-19 reinfection over time.Reinfections can and have happened, even shortly after recovery. And they will become increasingly common as immunity wanes and new SARS-CoV-2 variants arise. We tend to think about immunity as being immune or not immune. Our study cautions that we instead should be more focused on the risk of reinfection through time,  said Alex Dornburg, assistant professor of bioinformatics and genomics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who co-led the study with Townsend.  As new variants arise, previous immune responses become less effective at combating the virus. Those who were naturally infected early in the pandemic are increasingly likely to become reinfected in the near future. The team s data-driven model reveals striking similarities to the reinfection risks over time between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses.  Just like common colds, from one year to the next you may get reinfected with the same virus. The difference is that, during its emergence in this pandemic, COVID-19 has proven to be much more deadly.  said Townsend.  Due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and reinfect, it, too, is likely to transition from pandemic to an endemic disease,  added Dornburg. A hallmark of the modern world is going to be the evolution of new threats to human health,  said Townsend.  Evolutionary biology   which provided the theoretical foundations for these analyses   is traditionally considered a historical discipline. However, our findings underscore its important role in informing decision-making, and provide a crucial stepping stone toward robust knowledge of our prospects of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

The findings pave the way for treatments to combat a health problem that affects more than 40% of American adults. We know of hundreds of gene variants that are more likely to show up in individuals suffering obesity and other diseases. But  more likely to show up  does not mean causing the disease. This uncertainty is a major barrier to exploit the power of population genomics to identify targets to treat or cure obesity. To overcome this barrier, we developed an automated pipeline to simultaneously test hundreds of genes for a causal role in obesity. Our first round of experiments uncovered more than a dozen genes that cause and three genes that prevent obesity,  said Eyleen O Rourke of UVA s College of Arts & Sciences, the School of Medicine s Department of Cell Biology and the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center.  We anticipate that our approach and the new genes we uncovered will accelerate the development of treatments to reduce the burden of obesity. Obesity and our genesO Rourke s new research helps shed light on the complex intersections of obesity, diet and our DNA. Obesity has become an epidemic, driven in large part by high-calorie diets laden with sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. Increasingly sedentary lifestyles play a big part as well. But our genes play an important role too, regulating fat storage and affecting how well our bodies burn food as fuel. So if we can identify the genes that convert excessive food into fat, we could seek to inactivate them with drugs and uncouple excessive eating from obesity.Genomicists have identified hundreds of genes associated with obesity   meaning the genes are more or less prevalent in people who are obese than in people with healthy weight. The challenge is determining which genes play causal roles by directly promoting or helping prevent weight gain. To sort wheat from chaff, O Rourke and her team turned to humble worms known as C. elegans. These tiny worms like to live in rotting vegetation and enjoy feasting on microbes. However, they share more than 70% of our genes, and, like people, they become obese if they are fed excessive amounts of sugar.The worms have produced great benefits for science. They ve been used to decipher how common drugs, including the antidepressant Prozac and the glucose-stabilizing metformin, work. Even more impressively, in the last 20 years three Nobel prizes were awarded for the discovery of cellular processes first observed in worms but then found to be critical to diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. They ve also been fundamental to the development of therapeutics based on RNA technology.In new work just published in the scientific journal PLOS Genetics, O Rourke and her collaborators used the worms to screen 293 genes associated with obesity in people, with the goal of defining which of the genes were actually causing or preventing obesity. They did this by developing a worm model of obesity, feeding some a regular diet and some a high-fructose diet.This obesity model, coupled to automation and supervised machine learning-assisted testing, allowed them to identify 14 genes that cause obesity and three that help prevent it. Enticingly, they found that blocking the action of the three genes that prevented the worms from becoming obese also led to them living longer and having better neuro-locomotory function. Those are exactly the type of benefits drug developers would hope to obtain from anti-obesity medicines.More work needs to be done, of course. But the researchers say the indicators are encouraging. For example, blocking the effect of one of the genes in lab mice prevented weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity and lowered blood sugar levels. These results (plus the fact that the genes under study were chosen because they were associated with obesity in humans) bode well that the results will hold true in people as well, the researchers say. Anti-obesity therapies are urgently needed to reduce the burden of obesity in patients and the healthcare system,  O Rourke said.  Our combination of human genomics with causality tests in model animals promises yielding anti-obesity targets more likely to succeed in clinical trials because of their anticipated increased efficacy and reduced side effects.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/creating-moving-models-to-study-how-medicines-travel-in-the-body-354362,Creating Moving Models To Study How Medicines Travel in the Body University of Delaware chemical engineer Catherine Fromen is investigating how organ protection mechanisms work to improve the delivery of therapeutic medicines to the body  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The human body has built-in protections to keep pathogens out.That sneezing fit or stuffy nose when you have a cold? That s your body leveraging mucosal linings in your respiratory system to expel the offending virus.But these natural defenses also sometimes work to keep out medicines, a challenging problem that has hindered treatment solutions for diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and even COVID-19.University of Delaware chemical engineer Catherine Fromen wants to better understand how these organ-protection mechanisms work to improve the delivery of therapeutic medicines to the body.Fromen has been awarded a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Maximizing Investigator s Research Award program, which provides promising early-stage investigators with sustained funding to pursue novel ideas.The five-year MIRA grant will support core areas of Fromen s work focused on designing medicines that go to mucosal interfaces, such as inhalable vaccines for respiratory problems. She is particularly interested in knowing where these medicines need to go to overcome mucosal barriers, say in the lungs or the gastrointestinal tract, to better interact with immune cells. By better understanding how mucus and cells behave at these mucosal barriers, we can better design methods and medications to treat different problems at these protective barriers,  said Fromen, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.UDaily caught up with Fromen to learn about her plans for advancing this work.Q: What are mucosal interfaces, and why are they so important to human health?Fromen: Mucosal interfaces are found in the human body s respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive and urinary systems. These are the sites where we are most vulnerable and where pathogens infect first. Unique immune cells there can act independently from the body s overall immune system to produce region-specific responses to any foreign invaders. If we can deliver medicines directly to these cells at the front line, then we can think about improving the barrier protection and fighting off pathogens. With the lung, this could be solutions for diseases like lung cancer or infectious disease like COVID-19 or influenza. In the gut, this could be celiac disease, which is an improper immune (autoimmune) response to the gluten found in certain foods. Q: How do mucosal barriers work, and how do we want them to work better?Fromen: The body s immune system is often thought of like an army, where each of the different cell types have different military functions. You can think of the mucosal interface like the walls of a castle, with foot soldier cells patrolling the castle and lookout cells searching for trouble on the horizon. Either of these cells can go inside the castle and say,  Mount up; it's time  and direct the body s response to different problems.These immune cells spend a lot of time at this protective layer waiting for the right signal to do something. If we can flip a switch here, it can create a whole cascade of events to do something totally different that benefits the whole organ or patient. Q: Can you share an example?Fromen: Sometimes these cells have been trained incorrectly to be overprotective in a way that has unintended side effects. Maybe cells at this mucosal interface are supporting a tumor cell and they shouldn t be   can we give instructions to alert the immune cells that the tumor cell is bad, so that they wake up and do all the things they are normally good at doing?Currently, we are only able to deliver single-word instructions so those cells can marshal the troops to perform complicated actions. We need to be able to get better, more frequent messages to these cells.Q: Where will you begin?Fromen: We will initially focus on the lung since that s an area of expertise for my lab. However, the work is more broadly applicable to mucosal interfaces in other places like the human gut because both organs are in constant motion and have a huge surface area.In previous work, my lab created a 3D-printed lung model that incorporates the tissue s unique branched architecture. We plan to add motion to our model and run fluids and medicines through it to figure out how the system works at a fundamental level. Researchers have studied on a small-scale how mucous flows left to right or how things diffuse through it, but no one has looked at the bigger transport mechanisms   the thickness of the mucus, how long things can stay in one place, how things change. We want to see the lung moving as it creates air and the mucus on top of it, to study how medicines move through this macroscopic framework, even before they hit the mucus.Q: What will this tell you?Fromen: One of the biggest challenges we face from a pharmaceutical standpoint is not knowing where the medicine goes once inside the body. We can build simulation models to explore things like how medicines diffuse to the tissue when we put it at specific branches of the lung, but we don t know how to predict, effectively, where it goes inside the entire organ or how long it will stay there. The same is true in the gut. We can estimate, but each body is different. Additionally, most studies and simulations of how medicines move within the body assume a healthy person of a particular body weight. This can be problematic, since we know that a person s lungs can appear incredibly different depending on smoking status, age or weight. Currently, however, there is no way to incorporate this information into predicting how medicines will work. That s where our model comes in.Q: Why is it important to be able to study this movement?Fromen: Even something as simple as making the epiglottis   that little flap in your throat that covers the esophagus when you swallow   open or close is challenging. But this is a real pinch-point for inhaling medicines, so even a model with just a little motion could provide important information on how medicines move or disperse under various conditions, for example, short, shallow breaths versus longer, deeper breaths.Q: What other questions do you plan to address?Fromen: The other side of the work focuses on understanding what happens when the medicine gets where it is going. We need to unravel how the medicine s formulation design interacts with specific immune cells that live at the mucosal barrier. We have interesting data that these cells can live for longer by taking up foreign objects (medicines, viruses) and that their lifespan at the mucosal interface is regulated by frequency of these interactions. These sentinel cells are critical in taking outside information and coordinating tissue response. We want to explore whether, by changing the chemistry of the formulation of inhaled medicine, we can turn knobs to control what these immune cells are doing and for how long, to create a desired effect.Q: Where do you hope this work will lead?Fromen: There is so much disease that originates at this mucosal interface, so it s a real opportunity to improve human life. Think about vaccines   if we can better understand how to deliver medicines to treat cells directly at the site, it will be even better than getting a shot in the arm. I d love to see what we are making become therapeutic products that end up FDA approved to help patients with respiratory issues in my lifetime, or see our models used to screen therapeutics and advance personalized medicine.

The findings, along with the methods developed to obtain those findings, represent a significant advance in cancer research, and ultimately may lead to better ways of detecting, monitoring and treating cancers.As the researchers reported Sept. 30 in Nature Genetics, they used advanced techniques to record gene mutations, gene activity and gene-activity-programming marks on DNA called methylations, within individual tumor cells sampled from patients with gliomas, the most common type of brain cancer. In this way they mapped distinct tumor cell behaviors or  states  in gliomas, and identified key programming marks that appear to shift glioma cells from one state to another. These programming marks, in principle, could be targeted with future drugs.Combining their single-cell methods with a molecular-clock technique, the researchers created  ancestral trees  for the sampled tumor cells, depicting their histories of state changes. It s like having a time machine we can take a sample from a patient s tumor and infer many details of how that tumor has been developing,  said co-senior author Dr. Dan Landau, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, and a core member of the New York Genome Center. We ve been able to make observations here that have fundamental implications for how we should think about treating gliomas,  said co-senior author Dr. Mario Suva, an associate professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School, a pathologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.Tumors cells traditionally have been characterized in bulk, rather than individually, and in relatively simple ways, for example by their cell type of origin and by the receptors they bear on their surfaces. Drs. Landau and Suva, however, have helped pioneer the use of  single-cell multi-omics  methods to profile tumor cells individually and in much more detail.In the new study they used a three-layer method recording not only gene sequence and gene transcription information but also  epigenetic  transcription-controlling methylation marks on DNA for the first time on individual tumor cells directly from patients. The scientists sampled more than 100 tumor cells on average from each of seven patients with so-called IDH-mutant glioma, and from seven patients with a more treatment-resistant glioma called IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.They found that the cells in both cancers tended to be in one of four distinct states, ranging from stem-cell-like states to states like those of more mature brain cells. They also identified distinct patterns of DNA methylation that appear to account for shifts between these states; such patterns in principle could be disrupted with future therapies to suppress such state-changes and slow tumor development.Although the researchers  captured what was essentially a snapshot of cell states in the sampled tumors, they also devised a molecular clock method, based on the random changes in DNA methylations that naturally occur over time, to calculate a lineage tree for each cell depicting its history of different states, going back to the origin of the tumor.The lineage trees revealed among other things that glioblastoma cells, compared to cells from the lower-grade gliomas, had a high degree of  plasticity  allowing them relatively easily to switch back and forth between stem-like states and more mature states. The very plastic cellular architecture of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma may allow it to survive stem-cell-killing treatments by regenerating those cells from its pool of more mature cells,  said co-first author Dr. Federico Gaiti, a postdoctoral fellow in the Landau laboratory.The findings in general offer a wealth of insights about the dynamics of gliomas, insights that should be useful in developing better methods for detecting, staging, monitoring and treating them.The researchers now plan to use their single-cell multi-omics approach to study how gliomas respond to different treatments. In principle, they said, the approach can be used to study the development of any type of tumor, or even of genetic mutations that accrue with age in healthy tissues.Reference: Chaligne R, Gaiti F, Silverbush D, et al.

Originally created as a way to understand interactions between different mutations in proteins, the tool is now being used by McCandlish and his collaborators to learn about the complexities of gene expression and the chromosomal mutations associated with cancer. McCandlish says: This is one of the things that s really fascinating about mathematical research, is sometimes you can see connections between topics, which on the surface they seem so different, but at a mathematical level, they might be using some of the same technical ideas. All of these questions involve mapping the likelihood of different variations on a biological theme: which combinations of mutations are most likely to arise in a particular protein, for example, or which chromosome mutations are most often found together in the same cancer cell. McCandlish explains that these are problems of density estimation a statistical tool that predicts how often an event happens. Density estimation can be relatively straightforward, such as charting different heights within a group of people. But when dealing with complex biological sequences, such as the hundreds, or thousands of amino acids that are strung together to build a protein, predicting the probability of each potential sequence becomes astonishingly complex.McCandlish explains the fundamental problem his team is using math to address: Sometimes if you make, say one mutation to a protein sequence, it doesn t do anything. The protein works fine. And if you make a second mutation, it still works fine, but then if you put the two of them together, now you ve got a broken protein. We ve been trying to come up with methods to model not just interactions between pairs of mutations, but between three or four or any number of mutations. The methods they have developed can be used to interpret data from experiments that measure how hundreds of thousands of different combinations of mutations impact the function of a protein.This study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, began with conversations with two other CSHL colleagues: CSHL Fellow Jason Sheltzer and Associate Professor Justin Kinney. They worked with McCandlish to apply his methods to gene expression and the evolution of cancer mutations. Software released by McCandlish s team will enable other researchers to use these same approaches in their own work. He says he hopes it will be applied to a variety of biological problems.Reference: Chen W-C, Zhou J, Sheltzer JM, Kinney JB, McCandlish DM.

When validated and engineered into a portable design, the comb system could offer real-time, noninvasive analysis of human breath to detect and monitor diseases. JILA is jointly operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder.The JILA system  fingerprints  chemicals by measuring the colors and amounts of light absorbed as a laser frequency comb passes back and forth through breath samples loaded into a mirrored glass tube. Recent upgrades include a shift in the light spectrum analyzed from the near-infrared to the mid-infrared band, where more molecules absorb light, and advances in optical coatings and several other technologies to achieve detection sensitivity up to the parts-per-trillion level.As described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, NIST/JILA Fellows Jun Ye and David Nesbitt detected and monitored four biomarkers   methanol (CH3OH), methane (CH4), water (H2O) and a form of heavy water (HDO)   in the breath of a volunteer. These are indicators of health conditions such as, in the case of methane, intestinal problems. The researchers say it is feasible to use the same apparatus to detect six more chemicals: formaldehyde, ethane, carbonyl sulfide, ethylene, carbon disulfide and ammonia. In addition, extending the comb lasers further into the infrared should greatly expand the detection capability and enable the identification of many hundreds of trace breath chemicals. JILA researchers demonstrated a prototype comb breathalyzer in 2008 but did not develop it further at that time. They have now refocused on it, prompted by the possibility of eventually testing for COVID-19.  We are really quite optimistic and committed to pushing this technology to real medical applications,  Ye said.The most widely used analytical technique in breath research is gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, which can detect hundreds of exhaled molecules but works slowly, requiring tens of minutes. Most optical breath tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detect only one chemical. JILA is the only institution that has published research on comb breathalyzers, Ye said.Breath analysis is the leading medical application for frequency combs. Combs offer a combination of broad spectral coverage, high resolution and high sensitivity, potentially detecting tens of chemicals simultaneously. Among other advantages, the comb system would not require chemical reagents and complex laboratory facilities. Ye and Nesbitt are now working with other NIST researchers to engineer a compact version of the breathalyzer. The tube is only 55 centimeters (21.7 inches) long, but the laser comb is custom-made and somewhat bulky.The work is funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the National Science Foundation and NIST.Reference: Liang Q, Chan Y-C, Changala PB, Nesbitt DJ, Ye J, Toscano J.

A few years ago, scientists noticed that parts of the cytoskeleton would occasionally rearrange very rapidly, causing an earthquake-like disturbance in part of the cell. They named these disturbances cytoquakes, but no one understood how or why they happened.New computer simulations developed by University of Maryland researchers reveal that these cytoquakes are caused by the slow build up and sudden release of mechanical energy within the cell. The researchers believe the quakes may help the cell respond rapidly to signals from the outside environment, like chemicals produced by other cells or hormones in the bloodstream.The research appears in the October 8, 2021, issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""Cytoquakes represent a sudden remodeling of a very important component of the cell, but the physics behind them really wasn't known,"" said Garegin Papoian, a co-author of the study who is the Monroe Martin Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry with a joint appointment in the Institute for Physical Science and Technology at the University of Maryland. ""We think these cytoquakes must be biologically important because the cytoskeleton is involved in so many functions within the cell. Understanding the physics behind them can provide insight into how cells work.""The cytoskeleton is like an internal scaffolding within animal cells. It is made of a network of filaments that constantly grow, shrink, attach and detach from one another. In addition to providing structure to a cell, the filaments also serve as tracks for chemical signals to flow from one part of a cell to another.Papoian and his colleagues hypothesized that the sudden rapid restructuring that happens in cytoquakes was the result of the cytoskeleton's physical structure being particularly sensitive to its environment. He likens it to the sensitivity of a pile of sand compared with a brick. Both may be made of the same molecules, but the brick holds its structure, even under pressure, without collapsing. The pile of sand may hold its structure for a long while but then suddenly collapses into an avalanche of sliding sand.To test the hypothesis, the team created a computer simulation of a model cytoskeleton using a pioneering active matter simulation software that they developed called MEDYAN for ""mechanochemical dynamics of active networks."" The software applies the laws of chemistry and physics to determine how the molecules within the cytoskeleton interact and behave.The study revealed that the filaments in a cytoskeleton arrange themselves a bit like a shape-shifting tensegrity structure. In the macroscopic world, a tensegrity structure is a kind of geometric toy or sculpture made of cables and floating rods under tension and compression that appear to defy gravity. Analyzing these cellular tensegrity structures helped Papoian and his colleagues understand tension release within the cytoskeleton. They found that tension applied to one area of the structure can build and cause tension until it suddenly releases in another area. In other words, the cytoskeleton behaves more like a pile of sand than a brick.The physical structure of the cytoskeleton allows tension to build between some of the filaments like the tension between grains of sand in a sand pile or between two tectonic plates along a fault line. When some threshold is met, the tension suddenly releases, the pile of sand collapses, an earthquake rumbles or a cytoquake occurs.""We postulate that the cytoquake mechanism poises the cell to react quickly to external signals from its environment compared to a system without this mechanism,"" Papoian said.For example, if a cell involved in repairing injuries must rush to the site of a wound, the cytoquake mechanism may respond to chemical signals from the injury site by jolting the cell into motion. When a cell migrates through the body, the leading edge may also use this mechanism to project or collapse protrusions as the cell probes its local neighborhood.The team's next step will be to expand on their simulation methods to include more parts of a cell such as the nucleus. They recently simulated the outer membrane of a cell and analyzed how the cytoskeleton pushes against this membrane to form finger-like protrusions.""This work is showing us that we can use MEDYAN to model important components of a cell,"" Papoian said. ""Ideally, we would like to keep going and essentially build the fundamental model of a whole cell at single molecule resolution.""Reference: Floyd C, Levine H, Jarzynski C, Papoian GA.

Researchers first implanted electrodes in Sarah s brain that mapped different areas related to mood and identified a region that, if stimulated by impulses through the electrode, gave Sarah immediate relief from suicidal thoughts and low mood.The study, published in Nature Medicine, was outlined in a press briefing that involved Sarah and two UCSF academics, psychiatry professor Dr. Katherine Scangos and neurosurgeon Dr. Edward Chang. At the briefing, Sarah outlined the life-changing impact of the stimulation. Prior to enrolling in the trial, Sarah had exhausted available treatment options without relief.  My daily life had become so restricted and impoverished by depression that I felt tortured by each day I forced myself to resist the suicidal impulses that overtook me several times an hour,  Sarah explained.After the first round of targeted stimulation, Sarah felt an incredible, unprecedented change.  When I first received the stimulation, the  Ah-hah  moment occurred. I felt the most intensely joyous sensation and my depression was a distant nightmare for a moment,  she said.The reason Sarah felt this mood lift was because Chang had implanted an array of ten EEG electrodes into her brain, dotted across regions linked to mood and emotion, such as the hippocampus and amygdala.Over a ten-day period, researchers monitored Sarah s mood while she had the electrodes fitted and they identified a brain area called the ventral striatum that consistently induced a mood lift when stimulated. They also identified, using machine learning techniques, that brain waves produced in the amygdala spiked when Sarah experienced low mood.Putting this information together, Scangos and Chang s team devised stimulation parameters personalized to Sarah s brain networks.  We implanted a small, chronic neuromodulation device to continually monitor for abnormal amygdala activity and automatically trigger a pulse of stimulation when this was detected,  explained Scangos. This created a  closed loop , where stimulation was only delivered when Sarah s brain told the device it was required. This stands in contrast to previous brain stimulation methods that, when turned on, deliver a constant level of stimulation. The level of personalization achieved in this study was also unprecedented.Once the chronic implant was activated, the momentary lift Sarah previously experienced became a sustained improvement in her mood that changed her whole lifestyle, making hobbies that she previously used only to distract from suicidal thoughts feel enjoyable.A battery of questionnaires used to assess clinical symptoms showed that Sarah s mood had dramatically improved. Sarah rated at 36 on the Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) prior to treatment, which indicates severe depression, but several months after the device had been switched on, she dropped below 10 points, indicating remission. Sarah has now had the device implanted for 15 months and has felt the benefits of the device throughout that period.Dr. Paul E Holtzheimer, assistant professor of psychiatry and surgery at Dartmouth s Geisel School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research, said  This is a very exciting development. It s once of the first instances in psychiatry, a proof-of-principle, where you can use a neural signature to drive an intervention, in this case targeted focal brain stimulation, and see a seemingly meaningful behavioral response. Both the authors and Holtzheimer drew attention to the studies single-patient sample size, which means caution will need to be paramount. As Holtzheimer put it,  We have been burned many, many times. We need to wait until it has been replicated in a larger sample in a randomized, controlled way. To make the stimulation as efficient as possible, the team titrated the signal to Sarah s brain, eventually settling on a 1 mA dose lasting six seconds. This stimulation, which is delivered hundreds of times a day up to a maximum of 30 minutes of stimulation, is imperceptible to Sarah.The technology, while never-before used to treat depression, was largely inspired by Chang s earlier work in treating epilepsy, where monitoring electrical currents inside the brain is an essential technique.  The battery and pulse generator of this device is about the size of a matchbox,  explained Chang.The next steps for the researchers are to roll out the technique in more patients. The technique will need to be personalized using brain mapping for each patient, a technique that Chang hopes will one day be possible to do in a non-invasive manner.  Each electrode contact that we have used is recording from about a millimeter to a millimeter and a half of brain area and what has been quite striking about what we ve seen is that if you look a centimeter away, the signals can look very different  We re hopeful that having this kind of knowledge about the circuitries of depression will give us the common ground truth we need to develop more targeted non-invasive approaches.

The assembly members, in a press release, said that the prize had been awarded for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch.These two senses are essential to our survival, but prior to Julius and Patapoutian s work, it was unclear how our nervous system took in information about, for example, a very hot stove, and converted that into electrical impulses that could be acted on,  such as ceasing to touch said hot stove.  Predictions for this year s Nobel commonly suggested that awards be given to researchers behind the vaccines developed to treat COVID-19., But, under pressure (sorry), to nominate this recently advantageous research, the Nobel committee have stuck to their guns and awarded older work   Julius s from the late 1990s and Patapoutian s mainly from the early 2010s   that have had ramifications years later. That s not to say we won t see a vaccine Nobel at some point   the revolutionary gene editing tool CRISPR, developed in 2012, took eight years to secure a Nobel Prize for Chemistry for creators Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.   Julius, using capsaicin, the same chemical that gives chili peppers their intense heat, identified a gene and protein pair that encoded a receptor, later named TRPV1. When TRPV1 was inserted into cells that normally had nothing to do with sensing heat, those same cell became capsaicin sensitive. Julius realized that TRPV1 was a heat sensor, that became specifically activated when high heat levels were detected.  Later work identified cold-sensing proteins and even an entirely family of related receptors that tell our bodies about different temperature ranges.Patapoutian s research focused on a similar sensory head-scratcher   how does the body convert mechanical signals from the environment into electrical impulses that tell us, for example, someone is standing on your foot, or giving you a rather too-firm handshake?By poking individual cells with a tiny pipette and recording the electrical signals produced, Patapoutian produced a list of 72 candidate pressure-sensing genes that were painstakingly worked through. Eventually identifying a gene/protein combination that, when silenced in the cell, made it stop reacting to a pipette-delivered poke. This protein, Piezo1, was later joined by a related protein, Piezo2, that together respond to the sensation of pressure on cell membranes, releasing an ion burst that the sensory system can them interpret as pressure.Together, the duo s findings have given us incredible insight into how our bodies detect the world around us, explaining how we can recognize the sensation of warm hug or the cold shock of an ice cube down the back of a shirt. The research, aside from advancing our basic understanding of the nervous system, also provides us with new routes to understanding conditions where these senses are impaired or overstimulated, such as in chronic pain.","Published: October 4, 2021"

Blood flow to the neural tissue stops, and those tissues typically die. Because of the locations of the major arteries in the brain, many strokes affect motor function. Some affect vision, however, causing patients to lose their vision or find it compromised or diminished. A research team led by Purdue University s Alexander Chubykin, an associate professor of biological sciences in the College of Science, in collaboration with the team led by Gong Chen at Jinan University, China, has discovered a way to use gene therapy to turn glial brain cells into neurons, restoring visual function and offering hope for a way to restore motor function.Neurons don t regenerate. The brain can sometimes remap its neural pathways enough to restore some visual function after a stroke, but that process is slow, it s inefficient, and for some patients, it never happens at all. Stem cell therapy, which can help, relies on finding an immune match and is cumbersome and difficult. This new gene therapy, as demonstrated in a mouse model, is more efficient and much more promising. We are directly reprogramming the local glial cells into neurons,  Chubykin said.  We don t have to implant new cells, so there s no immunogenic rejection. This process is easier to do than stem cell therapy, and there s less damage to the brain. We are helping the brain heal itself. We can see the connections between the old neurons and the newly reprogrammed neurons get reestablished. We can watch the mice get their vision back. Chubykin s research is especially important because visual function is easier than motor skills to measure accurately, using techniques including optical imaging in live mice to track the development and maturation of the newly converted neurons over the course of weeks. Perfecting and understanding this technique could lead to a similar technique reestablishing motor function. This research bridges the gap in understanding between the basic interpretation of the neurons and the function of the organs.Reference: Tang Y, Wu Q, Gao M, et al.

So far, much of this activity has been measured via electrodes placed on the scalp (through electroencephalography (EEG)); however, being able to acquire signals directly from inside the brain itself (through neural interfacing devices) during daily life activities could take neuroscience and neuromedicine to completely new levels. A major setback to this plan is that, unfortunately, implementing neural interfaces has proven to be remarkably challenging.The materials used in the minuscule electrodes that make contact with the neurons, as well as those of all connectors, should be flexible yet durable enough to withstand a relatively harsh environment in the body. Previous attempts at developing long-lasting brain interfaces have proven challenging because the natural biological responses of the body, such as inflammation, degrade the electrical performance of the electrodes over time. But what if we had some practical way to locally administer anti-inflammatory drugs where the electrodes make contact with the brain?In a recent study published in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, a team of Korean researchers developed a novel multifunctional brain interface that can simultaneously register neuronal activity and deliver liquid drugs to the implantation site. Unlike existing rigid devices, their design has a flexible 3D structure in which an array of microneedles is used to gather multiple neural signals over an area, and thin metallic conductive lines carry these signals to an external circuit. One of the most remarkable aspects of this study is that, by strategically stacking and micromachining multiple polymer layers, the scientists managed to incorporate microfluidic channels on a plane parallel to the conductive lines. These channels are connected to a small reservoir (which contains the drugs to be administered) and can carry a steady flow of liquid toward the microneedles.The team validated their approach through brain interface experiments on live rats, followed by an analysis of the drug concentration in the tissue around the needles. The overall results are very promising, as Dr. Sohee Kim from Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Korea, who led the study, remarks:  The flexibility and functionalities of our device will help make it more compatible with biological tissues and decrease adverse effects, all of which contribute to increasing the lifespan of the neural interface. The development of durable multifunctional brain interfaces has implications across multiple disciplines.  Our device may be suitable for brain machine interfaces, which enable paralyzed people to move robotic arms or legs using their thoughts, and for treating neurological diseases using electrical and/or chemical stimulation over years,  explains Dr. Yoo Na Kang of the Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials (KIMM), first author of the study.

The findings have been published in the journal Cell Reports. By teasing out the microbial changes that occur in the small bowel with age, medication use and diseases, we hope to identify unique components of the microbial community to target for therapeutics and interventions that could promote healthy aging,  said Ruchi Mathur, MD, the study s principal investigator.Research exploring the gut microbiome, and its impact on health, has relied predominantly on fecal samples, which do not represent the entire gut, according to Mathur. In their study, investigators from Cedars-Sinai s Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program analyzed samples from the small intestine which is over 20 feet in length and has the surface area of a tennis court for examination of the microbiome and its relationship with aging. This study is the first of its kind to examine the microbial composition of the small intestine of subjects 18 years of age to 80. We now know that certain microbial populations are influenced more by medications, while others are more affected by certain diseases. We have identified specific microbes that appear to be only influenced by the chronological age of the person,  said Mathur, an endocrinologist and director of the Diabetes Outpatient Treatment & Education Center.The 21st century has been referred to as the  era of the gut microbiome  as scientists turn considerable attention to the role trillions of gut bacteria, fungi and viruses may play in human health and disease. The microbiome is the name given to the genes that live in these cells. Studies have suggested that disturbances in the constellations of the microbial universe may lead to critical illnesses, including gastroenterological diseases, diabetes, obesity, and some neurological disorders.While researchers know that microbial diversity in stool decreases with age, Cedars-Sinai investigators identified bacteria in the small bowel they refer to as  disruptors  that increase and could be troublesome. Coliforms are normal residents of the intestine. We found that when these rod-shaped microbes become too abundant in the small bowel as they do as we get older they exert a negative influence on the rest of the microbial population. They are like weeds in a garden,  said study co-author Gabriela Leite, PhD.Investigators also found that as people age, the bacteria in the small intestine change from microbes that prefer oxygen to those that can survive with less oxygen, something they hope to understand as the research continues. Our goal is to identify and fingerprint the small intestinal microbial patterns of human health and disease. Given the important role the small bowel plays in absorption of nutrients, changes in the microbiome in this location of the gut may have a greater impact on human health, and warrants further study,  said Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the MAST program and a co-author of the study.This research is part of Cedars-Sinai s ongoing REIMAGINE study: Revealing the Entire Intestinal Microbiota and its Associations with the Genetic, Immunologic, and Neuroendocrine Ecosystem.Reference: Leite G, Pimentel M, Barlow GM, et al.

This finding has been confirmed in an experiment by researchers from the URV, the University of Troms    The Arctic University of Norway and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, who propose a new approach to the debate on the advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism: a good performance in one area of linguistic ability may mean lower accuracy or speed in another, and vice-versa.The impact of bilingualism or plurilingualism on neural connectivity, brain activity, and behaviour is an issue that neuroscientists, psychologists, and linguists have been researching for decades because it generates intense debate about the pros and cons of bilingualism. Now, an experiment conducted by researchers at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Troms  University   The Arctic University of Norway and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology has studied the responses of bilingual and monolingual people when they read grammatical illusions, a category of manipulative discourse that deceives the mind by leading it to accept constructions that make no sense. The results of the experiment have necessarily changed the debate on bilingualism.A total of 276 people took part in the study: half were monolingual in Greek and the other half were bilingual in Greek and a Germanic language. They had to state whether the grammatical constructions presented to them were correct, incorrect, or neither correct nor incorrect. The analysis of the results showed that the bilingual participants obtained a higher percentage of correct answers, but also needed more time to detect if there were any anomalies.More specifically, bilinguals detected 56% of the grammatical illusions, whereas monolinguals detected only 39%. This means that bilingual people are better able to detect manipulations in a discourse. However, they need more time to come up with an answer, especially when they see that what is presented to them may not be correct. In the test, they took an average of 2 milliseconds to state that a grammatical construction was  correct  and 70 milliseconds to state that it was  incorrect .The results have been published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE and the researchers Evelina Leivada (URV), Natalia Mitrofanova (University of Troms    The Arctic University of Norway) and Marit Westergaard (University of Troms    The Arctic University of Norway and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology) emphasise that the need to change the focus of the debate around the advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism. Better performance in one domain is offset by decreased accuracy or speed when performing a task in another; therefore, we need to replace the concepts of advantage and disadvantage with the concept of multilingual adaptive compensation. In other words, the cognitive abilities of bilinguals can increase their ability to detect erroneous constructions, but this is part of a larger set of effects resulting from their bilingualism, not all of which are necessarily advantageous , concludes Evelina Leivada, researcher at the URV s Department of English and German Studies.Reference: Leivada E, Mitrofanova N, Westergaard M.

This reaction is of fundamental significance to a wide range of fields, including nuclear engineering, space travel, cancer treatment and environmental remediation. Their results were published in Science today.When high-energy radiation hits a water molecule, it triggers a series of ultrafast reactions. First, it kicks out an electron, leaving behind a positively charged water molecule. Within a fraction of a trillionth of a second, this water molecule gives up a proton to another water molecule. This leads to the creation of a hydroxyl radical (OH)   which can damage virtually any macromolecule in an organism, including DNA, RNA and proteins   and a hydronium ion (H3O+), which are abundant in the interstellar medium and tails of comets, and might contain clues about the origin of life.","Published: October 4, 2021"

A University of Arizona-led study published in Scientific Reports may offer some clues, and the findings reveal a surprising amount about our mental health.78 participants were trained to voice their thoughts aloud for 10 minutes while sitting alone in a room without access to electronic devices. Researchers used audio equipment to record those thoughts, then transcribed the recordings and analyzed them for content. In total, more than 2,000 thoughts were analyzed.""We wanted to mimic the small breaks we have throughout the day, such as when waiting in line at a caf , taking a shower, lying in bed at night and so on. These are all times during which external demands are minimal and internal thoughts tend to creep in,"" said first author Quentin Raffaelli, a graduate student in the UArizona Department of Psychology.      Most psychology research addressing human thought either tells people what to think about, asks participants to remember what they were thinking about minutes before, or uses self-report questionnaires to capture freeze-frame snapshots of thoughts at different moments in time, according to the authors.""While insightful in its own right, this snapshot approach doesn't tell us much about how thoughts unfold and transition over time   features of thinking that we think are important for our mental health.

For starters, there s the fact that this  second brain  exists at all. Most people don t even know that they have this in their guts,  said Brian Gulbransen, an MSU Foundation Professor in the College of Natural Science s Department of Physiology.Beyond that, the enteric nervous system is remarkably independent: Intestines could carry out many of their regular duties even if they somehow became disconnected from the central nervous system. And the number of specialized nervous system cells, namely neurons and glia, that live in a person s gut is roughly equivalent to the number found in a cat s brain. It s like this second brain in our gut,  Gulbransen said.  It s an extensive network of neurons and glia that line our intestines. Neurons are the more familiar cell type, famously conducting the nervous system s electrical signals. Glia, on the other hand, are not electrically active, which has made it more challenging for researchers to decipher what these cells do. One of the leading theories was that glial cells provide passive support for neurons.Gulbransen and his team have now shown that glial cells play a much more active role in the enteric nervous system. In research published online on Oct. 1 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Spartans revealed that glia act in a very precise way to influence the signals carried by neuronal circuits. This discovery could help pave the way for new treatments for intestinal illness that affects as much as 15% of the U.S. population. Thinking of this second brain as a computer, the glia are the chips working in the periphery,  Gulbransen said.  They re an active part of the signaling network, but not like neurons. The glia are modulating or modifying the signal. In computing language, the glia would be the logic gates. Or, for a more musical metaphor, the glia aren t carrying the notes played on an electric guitar, they re the pedals and amplifiers modulating the tone and volume of those notes.Regardless of the analogy, the glia are more integral to making sure things are running smoothly   or sounding good   than scientists previously understood. This work creates a more complete, albeit more complicated picture of how the enteric nervous system works. This also creates new opportunities to potentially treat gut disorders. This is a ways down the line, but now we can start to ask if there s a way to target a specific type or set of glia and change their function in some way,  Gulbransen said.  Drug companies are already interested in this. Earlier this year, Gulbransen s team found that glia could open up new ways to help treat irritable bowel syndrome, a painful condition that currently has no cure and affects 10% to 15% of Americans. Glia could also be involved in several other health conditions, including gut motility disorders, such as constipation, and a rare disorder known as chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Right now, there s no known cause. People develop what looks like an obstruction in the gut, only there s no physical obstruction,  Gulbransen said.  There s just a section of their gut that stops working. Although he stressed that science isn t at the point to deliver treatments for these problems, it is better equipped to probe and understand them more fully. And Gulbransen believes that MSU is going to be a central figure in developing that understanding. MSU has one of the best gut research groups in the world. We have this huge, diverse group of people working on all the major areas of gut science  he said.  It s a real strength of ours. Reference: Ahmadzai MM, Seguella L, Gulbransen BD.

Recurrent urinary tract infections are defined as two or more infections in six months or three or more in a year.Despite the prevalence of the painful condition, women are fearful and frustrated with limited management options, according to Cedars-Sinai research published in the Journal of Urology.Women who participated in the study were critical of healthcare providers for failing to understand their experiences while over-prescribing antibiotics as a treatment option.""We were inspired to conduct the study due to the large number of women coming to us feeling hopeless and helpless when it came to the management of their UTIs,"" said lead author Victoria Scott, MD, a urologist at the Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery clinic at Cedars-Sinai.To help give voice to those suffering with recurrent urinary tract infections, researchers led a focus group study of 29 women who experienced recurrent UTIs to learn about gaps in their care. UTIs are infections of any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder or the urethra. The term is most commonly used to describe a bladder infection.One of the biggest concerns expressed by study participants revolved around the frequent prescribing of antibiotics and fears of the potential adverse and long-term effects of the medication.""Many of the participants were aware of the risks of bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics,"" Scott said. ""They also were aware of the 'collateral damage' of antibiotics and disruption they can have on the normal balance of good and bad bacteria throughout the body.""The focus group discussions also reported concern with the medical system and limited research efforts to investigate new non-antibiotic management strategies.Participants voiced frustration and resentment toward their medical providers for  throwing antibiotics  at them without presenting alternative options for treatment and prevention, and for not understanding their experience. In addition, many women described seeking advice from herbalists and acupuncture practitioners, as well as from peers in online forums and chatrooms.","Published: October 4, 2021"

They also considered the implications for conservation targets that call for 30% of Earth s habitats to be formally protected by 2030.  At its most basic level, this study attempts to understand what shifts in the distribution of the Earth s ecoregions and biomes will mean for the capacity to conserve and protect biological diversity using protected areas,  said Solomon Dobrowski, the paper s lead author and a professor of forest landscape ecology in the University s W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation. Scientists have divided Earth s terrestrial areas into roughly 800 ecoregions. An ecoregion is an ecosystem defined by distinctive geography and biota. These combinations of plants and animals act as surrogates for the planet s biodiversity and provide a means for scientists, international organizations and countries to track whether protected areas represent the planet s biodiversity. Countries around the world use protected-area designations to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas come in lots of flavors, Dobrowski said, like national parks in the U.S. But one thing they all have in common are fixed boundaries that delineate a place on the ground. Climate change will likely affect what ecosystems are represented in protected areas, Dobrowski and his co-authors contend in the new study, but how remains unclear. It s also unclear how that could affect the effectiveness of conservation strategies that rely on protected areas   like the United Nations s draft of the Post-2020 Global Diversity Framework, better known as 30 by 30, which calls for permanently protecting 30% of the Earth by 2030 through expanding the protected area network, among other initiatives. (In the U.S., there also is the America the Beautiful initiative, which aims to conserve 30% of America s lands and waters by 2030.) The 30 by 30 framework will be addressed at the UN Biodiversity Conference COP-15, which kicks off online in October.  The UN, in coordination with many countries and international conservation organizations, is promoting the expansion of the protected area network so that 30% of all ecoregions are protected by 2030,  Dobrowski said.  But what happens when plants and animals, and therefore ecoregions, move over time to track their optimal climate but the protected area boundaries stay fixed in place?  Even if 30% of a given ecoregion may be protected now, as the ecoregions shift in response to climate change, that protection and representation within the protected area network will change,  he said. To address these questions, the scientists used spatial climate analogs   present day locations that share similar climates to those projected for a location in the future   to examine how a 2-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures could alter the distribution of ecoregions.  Then the scientists analyzed what that those changes could mean for achieving 30 by 30. They found that roughly half of the Earth s land area will experience climate conditions that correspond with different ecoregions.  Climate change has the potential to dramatically shift the ecosystems of the planet,  Dobrowski said.  We project by mid-century that over 50% of ecoregions globally will have a climate associated with a totally different ecoregion. We look at the world around us, and we see ecosystems that we are used to seeing. We think they re stable, but they re not. And those kinds of changes are going to challenge our ability to conserve biodiversity globally.  The authors recommend that efforts to protect biodiversity will need to explicitly consider how climate change will drive changes in the patterns of biodiversity.  We re dealing with a moving target in terms of trying to capture the planet s biodiversity in protected areas,  said co-author Caitlin Littlefield, formerly a UM postdoc and now with Conservation Science Partners.  In this work, we provide a model for how people can anticipate dynamic and shifting patterns of biodiversity and respond with strategic conservation investments.  To extend their results more broadly, the group also created an online tool, Analog Atlas (https://plus2c.org/), to inform the public of the ways climate change could alter the ecosystems where they live and play. Climate analogs contextualize climate change by asking a simple question:  Where can I find the climate of my future, today?  Dobrowski said. Users can select any land area on the globe and see another location where the current climate matches future predicted conditions for that selected location.  We are really excited about the Analog Atlas,  said co-author Sean Parks of the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute.  It allows users to conceptualize climate change through maps, street views and statistics such as expected changes in the number of hot days, freezing nights and fire conducive days, Reference Dobrowski SZ, Littlefield CE, Lyons DS, et al.

This natural process is based on a cooperative interaction between different types of microorganisms: the fermenting bacteria and the methane-producing archaea. The former converts so-called primary fermentation products from biomass decomposition, including fatty acids into intermediate products such as acetic acid, formate or H2. Specialized archaea can then form methane from them. The syntrophic interaction of fermenting bacteria with methanogenic archaea is crucial for the globally relevant conversion of biomass into methane. However, scientists have not yet been able to clarify how the oxidation of saturated fatty acids can be coupled with the thermodynamically extremely unfavorable reduction of CO2 to methane and how such a process can enable the growth of both microorganisms involved. A research team from the University of Freiburg, the Technical University of Darmstadt and the University of Bern in Switzerland led by Prof. Dr. Matthias Boll from the Institute of Biology II at the University of Freiburg has now been able to uncover a crucial step in this process: they found the missing enzymatic link and its function, which makes methane formation from fatty acids traceable from an energetic standpoint. The researchers published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists investigated a previously uncharacterized membrane-bound oxidoreductase (EMO) from the fermenting bacterium Syntrophus aciditrophicus. They provided biochemical evidence that the heme-b cofactors of this membrane-bound oxidoreductase and a modified quinone with perfectly matched redox potentials are the main players in this microbial process. Bioinformatics analyses also suggest that these oxidoreductases are widely distributed in prokaryotes, organisms such as bacteria and archaea whose cells lack a nucleus.  The results not only close our knowledge gap on the conversion of biomass to methane,  Boll explains.  We may additionally identify EMOs as previously overlooked key components of lipid metabolism in the vast majority of all microorganisms. ReferenceAgne M, Estelmann S, Seelmann CS, et al.

These receptors work as molecular messengers because they receive the signal on the outside of the cells, and then transmit the message to the inside. This allows the cells to trigger specific responses and initiate the corresponding physiological process in our body.Some receptors present in the cell membrane have been classified as ""silent"" or ""non-functional"" receptors. These receptors do not appear to act like similar receptors in our body. An example investigated in the current study is a receptor for a complement peptide in our blood called C5aR2.Complement C5a plays a critical role in our body's immune response. It binds to, and activates, two different types of receptor proteins present in the cells C5aR1 and C5aR2. The C5aR1 is a well-studied receptor, but the working mechanism behind C5aR2 has proved to be more difficult to fully comprehend.""Using a set of biochemical and structural methods, we have discovered that these so-called ""non-functional"" receptors, including C5aR2, signal through alternative mechanisms mediated by another type of protein called arrestins,"" says Dr. Arun K. Shukla, Joy Gill Chair Professor at IIT Kanpur who spearheaded this study in collaboration with researchers at Tohoku University, McGill University and Queensland University. Associate Professor at Tohoku University Dr. Inoue adds, ""We distinguished the behaviors of arrestins in C5aR"" from those in C5aR1.""Their breakthrough is pertinent to COVID-19. Scientists have previously found that the activation of the complement cascade in COVID-19 patients leads to the excessive release of small cytokine proteins in the bloodstream - a situation known as a ""cytokine storm.""Scientists are trying to block this by targeting C5aR1 with monoclonal antibodies. ""Our study offers another means of targeting C5aR2 by designing new drug molecules to block its activation,"" says Dr. Shukla.The team is now focusing on visualizing these receptors at atomic details in order to figure out how precisely they differ from the conventional GPCRs, and to identify a novel class of small molecules that can bind these receptors.""We are very excited to decipher the finer details of these receptors using cutting-edge technologies such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

Not only did the study find that the removal of refined grains reduced nutrient levels in both age groups by a significant amount, but it also found that this led to a reduced energy intake by  10% in both age groups. These effects combined reveal the nutritional impact from removing refined grains from the diet. The study was conducted with the knowledge that the participants were lacking essential nutrients from their daily diets beforehand. While this did not affect the study s outcome, it further highlighted the importance of consuming refined grains (bread, ready-to-eat cereals, and all-grained foods) in order to compensate for the lack of nutrition occurring elsewhere.  Whenever you remove entire food groups or a majority of foods from select food groups, you will have nutrient shortfalls and likely will not have the kind of energy needed to sustain your daily activities, and grains are no exception,  said Stacey Krawczyk, principal consulting registered dietitian for the Grain Foods Foundation and president of FoodWell Strategies, when asked about the new study. She continued,  There are not many peer-reviewed studies out there that examine the nutrient contributions of staple refined, enriched, and fortified grains in the American diet, so the hope is that this data will provide people with the understanding they need to help recover potential nutrient shortfalls in their diet.ReferencePapanikolaou Y, Fulgoni VLI.

Such measures can help predict whether a person is at risk of heart attack or stroke. But there is no blood test that can accurately assess the degree to which a person s arteries may be narrowing or at risk of blockage.Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have shown that high levels of a specific protein circulating in the blood accurately detect a severe type of peripheral artery disease that narrows the arteries in the legs and can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. The protein, called circulating fatty acid synthase (cFAS), is an enzyme that manufactures saturated fatty acids. Until recently, fatty acid synthase was thought to be found only inside cells. The new study suggests that fatty acid synthase also circulates in the bloodstream and may have an important role in the plaque formation characteristic of cardiovascular disease.About 12 million people in the U.S. have some form of peripheral artery disease, a narrowing of the arteries in the legs, and about 1 million of these patients develop a severe form called chronic limb-threatening ischemia. These patients often undergo vascular surgery to open up their peripheral arteries in an effort to improve blood flow to the legs. In severe cases, patients may need to have the diseased leg amputated. These patients are at risk of losing their legs, which is devastating to quality of life,  said senior author Mohamed A. Zayed, MD, PhD, an associate professor of surgery and of radiology.  They lose their capacity to walk, and about half of them die within the next two years. We need to identify these patients sooner, so we can help treat them aggressively much earlier in the disease course. Our data suggest that levels of cFAS in the blood could be an accurate predictor for which patients are at high risk of the severe forms of this condition. Zayed and his colleagues collected blood samples from 87 patients before they underwent vascular surgery to treat chronic limb-threatening ischemia. The researchers found that cFAS levels in the blood were independently associated with the disease. A diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes and smoking status also were strongly and independently correlated with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. When all three of these factors were considered together, they could predict the presence of the disease with 83% accuracy.The researchers also found that cFAS levels in the blood were associated with the fatty acid synthase content of plaque sampled from the femoral artery, the main vessel supplying blood to the legs. In addition, the researchers found that cFAS circulates through the bloodstream while bound to LDL, the so-called  bad  LDL cholesterol, which raises an intriguing question. Oftentimes, I will see patients in my practice who have high LDL but are otherwise healthy individuals   they don t have evidence of disease in their arteries,  said Zayed, who is also a vascular surgeon at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  We ve scratched our heads at this. Do we put these patients on cholesterol-lowering medication? Are they still at high risk of cardiovascular disease? Our guidelines tell us to be aggressive in treating these patients. But my suspicion is the problem is not just LDL. Rather, the problem is enzymes that are attached to LDL that are conferring the cardiovascular disease that we see, particularly in the peripheral arteries, as well as the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart and the carotid arteries that deliver blood to the brain. The researchers have found that LDL is more abundant than cFAS in the blood, so the key measure may not be LDL itself, but how much of the LDL is carrying cFAS along with it.In past work, Zayed and his colleagues showed that blood cFAS levels also are elevated in patients with plaque buildup in the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain. That work also showed that the cFAS circulating in the blood originates from the liver. The evidence suggests that LDL serves as a delivery vehicle for cFAS that then contributes to the formation of plaque in key arteries throughout the body.Zayed and his colleagues also are investigating cFAS as a possible target of new drug therapies that could slow plaque buildup and treat or prevent cardiovascular disease. There are drugs that inhibit fatty acid synthase, and we re working on evaluating new ones that are more targeted,  Zayed said.  None of them are ready for clinical trials in people for this purpose yet, but we re using those drugs to test animal models of the disease to see if they actually decrease the buildup of plaque in the arteries. It would be wonderful to be able to practice precision vascular medicine   to tailor therapy to high-risk patients to reduce their risk of developing severe complications of cardiovascular disease. In the meantime, Zayed is working with Washington University s Office of Technology Management to develop a test kit for measuring cFAS in the blood so that high-risk patients may be identified earlier.Reference: Tay S, De Silva GS, Engel CM, et al.

Currently, it takes health care professionals hours to diagnose a heart attack. Initial results from an echocardiogram can quickly show indications of heart disease, but to confirm a patient is having a heart attack, a blood sample and analysis is required. Those results can take up to eight hours. The current methods used to diagnose a heart attack are not only time intensive, but they also have to be applied within a certain window of time to get accurate results,  said Pinar Zorlutuna, the Sheehan Family Collegiate Professor of Engineering at Notre Dame and lead author of the paper.  Because our sensor targets a combination of miRNA, it can quickly diagnose more than just heart attacks without the timeline limitation. By targeting three distinct types of microRNA or miRNA, the newly developed sensor can distinguish between an acute heart attack and a reperfusion   the restoration of blood flow, or reperfusion injury, and requires less blood than traditional diagnostic methods to do so. The ability to differentiate between someone with inadequate blood supply to an organ and someone with a reperfusion injury is an unmet, clinical need that this sensor addresses. The technology developed for this sensor showcases the advantage of using miRNA compared to protein-based biomarkers, the traditional diagnostic target,  said Hsueh-Chia Chang, the Bayer Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Notre Dame and co-author of the paper.  Additionally, the portability and cost efficiency of this device demonstrates the potential for it to improve how heart attacks and related issues are diagnosed in clinical settings and in developing countries. A patent application has been filed for the sensor and the researchers are working with Notre Dame s IDEA Center to potentially establish a startup company that would manufacture the device.Reference: Ren X, Ellis BW, Ronan G, et al.

The development of ultrashort laser pulses now allows scientists to study extremely fast phenomena, like charge transport in molecules and elementary steps of chemical reactions. But beyond that, our ability to observe such processes on the attosecond scale (one quintillionth of a second) means that it is also possible to steer and probe the dynamics of individual electrons on their natural timeframes.One of the emerging ultrafast technologies is attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS), which can track the movement of electrons at a specific site of a molecule. This is a particularly appealing feature of ATAS, because it permits tracing the evolution of the molecular system with spatial resolution at the atomic scale.Modern lasers can push chemistry into unexplored domains of light-matter interactions, where the role of theory in interpreting the results of ATAS measurements will be more important than ever before. But so far, the theory behind ATAS has been developed only for atoms or for molecules either in the absence of nuclear motion or in the absence of electronic coherence.Now, a team of physicists from EPFL's Laboratory of Theoretical Physical Chemistry (LCPT) have extended ATAS theory to molecules, including a full account of the correlated electron-nuclear dynamics.The work, in collaboration with Alexander Kuleff at Heidelberg University, is published in Physical Review Letters. We present a simple quasi-analytical expression for the absorption cross-section of molecules, which accounts for the nuclear motion and non-adiabatic dynamics and is composed from physically intuitive terms,  says Nikolay Golubev, a postdoc at LCPT and the study's lead author.By extending ATAS theory, the scientists also show that this spectroscopy technique has sufficient resolution to  see  the follow-up decoherence of electron motion caused by the molecule s nuclear rearrangement.Putting theory into practice, the team tested the polyatomic molecule propiolic acid as an example.  The simulation of X-ray ATAS of the propiolic acid was made possible by combining high-level ab initio electronic structure methods with efficient semiclassical nuclear dynamics,  says Ji  Van ek, head of the LCPT. By advancing our knowledge of the correlated motion of electrons and nuclei in molecules, the findings of the LCPT researchers could also help our understanding of various other  attochemistry  phenomena.Reference: Golubev NV, Van ek J, Kuleff AI.

A recent study conducted at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health, shows that the support cells around axons provide a way to boost local energy production. The new findings, published in the journal Neuron, help explain how long axons maintain sufficient energy levels and could have implications for the treatment of several neurological disorders, including Parkinson s disease, Huntington s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), linked to disruptions in axonal energy supply. Many major neurological disorders involve the degeneration of axons, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased energy levels, or problems with oligodendrocytes,  said Zu-Hang Sheng, Ph.D., senior investigator at NINDS.  Our findings uncover a way for axons to maintain energy and could help us better understand the causes of neurological disorders and how we might treat them.      All cells including neurons use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for fuel, which is created by structures within cells called mitochondria. The NINDS research team led by Dr. Sheng discovered that oligodendrocytes cells that typically support axons by wrapping them in an insulating material called myelin  release an enzyme, SIRT2, that ramps up mitochondrial activity. This enzyme, when picked up by axons, provides a local power boost by increasing energy production. Neurons require considerable amounts of ATP for energy, but ATP has a hard time traveling down long axons,  said Dr. Sheng.  We wanted to understand how neurons can keep energy levels high inches, or even sometimes feet, all the way along the axon.  Like regional power plants built to provide electricity to remote locations, mitochondria are located along long axons to generate ATP in areas where it is needed. Previous studies showed that axons that have had myelin removed contain more mitochondria, while genetic changes that affect oligodendrocytes also impact energy production in axons.       Using a state-of-the-art energy sensor that changes color based on local ATP availability, Dr. Sheng s team compared energy levels in neurons and their axons grown in cell dishes with or without oligodendrocytes. What they saw was that the axons grown with oligodendrocytes had significantly more ATP than those without, suggesting there was some connection between the support cells and the levels of energy in axons.Next, Dr. Sheng and his colleagues created  conditioned media  by growing oligodendrocytes in lab dishes for several days and then collecting media but not the cells. The conditioned media was then added to dishes containing neurons, and this treatment also increased ATP levels, which meant that oligodendrocytes were releasing cellular components into their environment that ramped up energy production in axons.The question remained: what was being released by the oligodendrocytes? To answer this, Drs. Chamberlain and Huang, two leading authors of the study, and their collaborators isolated exosomes packages released from cells that contain signaling molecules from oligodendrocytes and showed that they too can increase energy production in axons. Taking advantage of a previous study that identified many components within exosomes, the researchers focused on a protein called SIRT2 and confirmed that it is present at high levels in oligodendrocytes, but not neurons.SIRT2 also made an intriguing target because it is an enzyme that modifies proteins, including those in mitochondria and specifically those linked to ATP production. When the researchers genetically turned on SIRT2 in neurons, they saw significantly higher ATP levels. In contrast, when neurons were grown with oligodendrocytes missing the gene for SIRT2, no increase in energy was seen. Finally, when SIRT2-containing exosomes were added to the spinal cords of mice lacking the gene for SIRT2, there was a strong increase in mitochondrial function. Together, these findings suggest oligodendrocytes help axons maintain high levels of energy when needed.Several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, have been linked to a failure of mitochondria to produce sufficient energy in neurons and their axons. The discovery of SIRT2 as a transcellular signal that can boost energy production locally within axons means that this pathway could be a potential target for future therapies for certain neurodegenerative disorders.Reference: Chamberlain KA, Huang N, Xie Y, et al.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/treatment-designed-to-reverse-vaccination-and-train-the-immune-system-354305,Treatment Designed To Reverse Vaccination and Train the Immune System Scientists have developed a novel treatment that uses reverse vaccination to pre expose the body to medications and build immune tolerance  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For nearly a third of patients with hemophilia A and almost all patients with Pompe disease, their own immune system is their greatest obstacle to treatment. When given essential proteins and enzymes, their body perceives the treatments as a threat and attacks.However, University at Buffalo researchers have developed a new treatment that uses reverse vaccination to pre-expose the body to medications and build immune tolerance. The novel treatment pairs essential proteins and enzymes with lysophosphatidylserine (Lyso-PS), a fatty acid that helps the immune system tolerate foreign substances, reducing adverse reactions to the drugs.Unlike traditional vaccination, which uses pre-exposure to teach the immune system to attack potential threats, reverse vaccination uses exposure to teach the immune system to ignore foreign substances. The treatment could be applied to a broad range of drug therapies, autoimmune disorders and allergies, says lead investigator Sathy Balu-Iyer, PhD, professor of pharmaceutical sciences and associate dean for research in the UB School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.The results were published this month in Scientific Reports. Balu-Iyer recently received funding to continue preclinical research from the Empire Discovery Institute, which will license the technology and advance the treatment to the market. The safety and effectiveness of several life-saving therapeutic drugs are compromised by anti-drug antibodies. Once antibodies develop, clinical options available for patients become expensive and, in several cases, ineffective,  said Balu-Iyer. Instead of attempting to reverse the anti-drug antibodies, which is highly challenging, clinical treatments that prevent antibody development may be a more effective strategy,  says Nhan Hanh Nguyen, first author and pharmaceutical sciences graduate student at UB.  Our approach is based on the rationale that pre-exposure of a protein in the presence of Lyso-PS teaches the immune system not to mount a response. Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by the lack of blood-clotting protein Factor VIII. Patients with the disorder are at severe risk for bleeding after injury or surgery. Recombinant Factor VIII is the first line of defense in treatment, however, the body may associate Factor VIII with other threats and produces antibodies that destroy it. A third of patients experience these adverse reactions, and once antibodies develop, the cost of clinical treatments may rise above $700,000 per year.For Pompe disease, a rare genetic condition in which the body lacks the enzyme necessary to break down complex sugars for energy, more than 90% of patients develop antibodies to treatments. Without the enzyme, acid alpha glucosidase (GAA), sugar builds up in the muscles and organs, causing weakness and shortening life expectancy. Attempts to suppress the immune system expose patients to risk of secondary infection.Findings published in August in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis found that four weeks of co-administration of Lyso-PS with Factor VIII significantly reduced the development of antibodies without impacting the effectiveness of the protein.The new research designed and tested a Lyso-PS nanoparticle with the ideal size and surface characteristics for cellular uptake, binding and survival in the digestive tract.The study found that the designed Lyso-PS nanoparticle prevented the development of antibodies against Factor VIII in 75% of subjects, and significantly reduced antibody levels against GAA.The treatment was effective when delivered intravenously as well as orally, the latter of which could allow for easier consumption and improved medication compliance by patients, says Balu-Iyer.Reference: Nguyen NH, Glassman FY, Dingman RK, et al.

The technique is based on two state-of-the-art microscopy methods, three-photon microscopy and adaptive optics. The paper reporting on this advancement was published on 30th September 2021 in Nature Methods.Until the development of the new technique, it was challenging for neuroscientists to observe astrocytes generating calcium waves in deep layers of the cortex, or to visualise any other neural cells in the hippocampus, a region deep in the brain that is responsible for spatial memory and navigation. The phenomenon takes place regularly in the brains of all live mammals. By developing the new technique, Lina Streich from the Prevedel Group and her collaborators were able to capture the fine details of these versatile cells at unprecedented high resolution. The international team included researchers from Germany, Austria, Argentina, China, France, the USA, India, and Jordan.In the neurosciences, brain tissues are observed mostly in small model organisms or in ex vivo samples that need to be sliced up to be observed   both of which represent non-physiological conditions. Normal brain cell activity takes place only in live animals, but the  mouse brain is a highly scattering tissue,  said Robert Prevedel.  In these brains, light cannot be focused very easily, because it interacts with the cellular components. This limits how deep you can generate a crisp image, and it makes it very difficult to focus on small structures deep inside the brain with traditional techniques. Thanks to Streich, a former PhD student in the lab who worked for more than four years to overcome this problem, scientists can now peer further into tissues. With traditional fluorescence brain microscopy techniques, two photons are absorbed by the fluorescence molecule each time, and you can make sure that the excitement caused by the radiation is confined to a small volume,  explained Prevedel, a physicist by training.  But the further the photons travel, the more likely they are lost due to scattering.  One way to overcome this is to increase the wavelength of the exciting photons towards the infrared, which ensures enough radiation energy to be absorbed by the fluorophore. In addition, using three photons instead of two allows to obtain crisper images deep inside the brain. But another challenge remains: making sure that the photons are focused, so that the whole image is not blurry.This is where the second technique used by Streich and her team is important. Adaptive optics is used regularly in astronomy   and indeed it was crucial for Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez to obtain the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 for their discovery of black holes. Astrophysicists use deformable, computer-controlled mirrors to correct in real time for the distortion in the light wave front caused by atmospheric turbulence. In Prevedel s lab, the distortion is caused by the scattering inhomogeneous tissue, but the principle and the technology are very similar.  We also use an actively controlled deformable mirror, which is capable of optimising the wave fronts to allow the light to converge and focus even deep inside the brain,  explained Prevedel.  We developed a custom approach to make it fast enough to use on live cells in the brain,  added Streich. To reduce the invasiveness of the technique, the team also minimised the number of measurements needed to achieve high-quality images. This is the first time these techniques have been combined,  said Streich,  and thanks to them, we were able to show the deepest in vivo images of live neurons at high resolution.  The scientists, who worked in collaboration with colleagues from EMBL Rome and the University of Heidelberg, even visualised the dendrites and axons that connect the neurons in the hippocampus, while leaving the brain completely intact. This is a leap towards developing more advanced non-invasive techniques to study live tissues,  Streich said. Although the technique was developed for use on a mouse brain, it is easily applicable to any opaque tissue.  Besides the obvious advantage of being able to study biological tissues without the need to sacrifice the animals or to remove overlaying tissue, this new technique opens the way to study an animal longitudinally, that is, from the onset of a disease to the end. This will give scientists a powerful instrument to better understand how diseases develop in tissues and organs. Reference: Streich L, Boffi JC, Wang L, et al.

They found that early accumulation of tau proteins in the brain as measured by PET scanner was more effective at predicting memory impairment than biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid plaque in the brain. The results are published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.Over 50 million people around the world suffer from dementia. Alzheimer s disease is the most common form of dementia and is characterised by an accumulation of the proteins beta-amyloid (Ab) and tau in the brain, followed by a continuous progression in memory decline. The pathological progression can take different forms and it is difficult to predict how quickly the symptoms will develop in any particular individual. Moreover, the presence of Ab in a person s brain   known as amyloid plaque   does not necessarily mean that the he or she will develop Alzheimer s dementia. There s been a rapid development of different Alzheimer s biomarkers in recent years, enabling us to measure and detect early signs of the disease in patients,  says the study s first author Marco Bucci, researcher at the Center for Alzheimer Research, part of the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet.  But we still need to find tests that can predict the development of the disease with greater specificity, so that we can improve not only its diagnosis but also its prognosis and treatment. Some biomarkers identify accumulations of A  or tau, while others are used to measure the loss of nerve function (neurodegeneration). Protein accumulation and neurodegeneration can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, or through brain imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Current guidelines for the early detection of Alzheimer s disease with biomarkers endorse the interchangeability of brain imaging methods and analyses of CSF biomarkers (pTau and Ab), but this has been mooted. There is also a lack of longitudinal studies showing how the biomarkers are linked to gradual cognitive impairment. Our study shows that the presence of amyloid plaque in the brain and changes in concentrations of Ab and pTau in the CSF can be detected early during the course of the disease, but they do not seem to have any correlation with later memory loss,  says Dr Bucci.  However, our results show that the presence of tau in the brain measured by a PET scanner is linked to a rapid decline, especially of the episodic memory, which is often affected at an early stage of the disease. Our observation suggests that tau PET should be recommended for the clinical prognostic assessment of cognitive decline in Alzheimer s patients. The results are based on brain imaging (PET and MRI) and CSF analyses in a group of 282 participants comprising people with mild cognitive impairment, people with Alzheimer s dementia and healthy controls. 213 of the participants were also monitored for three years with tests of episodic memory (i.e. short term memory related to daily events). Our findings show that the concentration of tau in the brain in Alzheimer s disease plays an important part in its pathological progression and may become a key target for future drug treatments,  says principal investigator Agneta Nordberg, professor at the Center for Alzheimer Research, Karolinska Institutet.The study was financed by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, the Swedish Research Council, Region Stockholm, the Swedish Brain Fund, the Swedish Alzheimer s Foundation, the Centre for Innovative Medicine and the Swedish Society for Medical Research.

If it is missing, the neurons' branches are less abundant. In addition, it is then more difficult to inhibit the activity of the cells. This is consistent with the fact that there is less SLK in diseased brain tissue from epilepsy patients. Epileptic seizures are characterized by overexcitation of neuron clusters. The findings may help to improve treatment of the disease. The study is published in the prestigious Journal of Neuroscience.SLK belongs to the large group of kinases. These enzymes are extremely important: They attach phosphate groups (which are small molecular residues with a phosphorus atom in the center) to proteins and thus alter their activity. Kinases are involved in the regulation of almost all life processes in animals.The kinase SLK was already known to play an important role in embryonic development: One of its effects is on the growth of cells and their migration in the body; these processes are also essential for the maturation of neurons. ""We therefore investigated what function SLK performs in nerve cells,"" explains Prof. Dr. Albert Becker from the Institute of Neuropathology at the University of Bonn.The researchers inhibited the production of the SLK protein in neurons of mice.

How to best treat chronic pain? First, pain must be categorized for the right treatment to be prescribed. However, is that it is very challenging for patients to define their pain, its intensity or even its location using questionnaires. To overcome this difficulty, scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) have joined forces with the research department of the Clinique romande de r adaptation (CRR) in Sion to carry out a complete epigenomic analysis of patients, making it possible to find the epigenetic signatures specific to each pain category. Thus, a simple blood test would make it possible to define which pain the person suffers from and, in the future, to prescribe treatment accordingly and to observe whether the biomarkers modified by the pain return to normal. These results can be read in the Journal of Pain.Chronic pain is classified into two main categories: nociceptive pain   defined by the activation of receptors at the end of nerve fibres and found in osteoarthritis, burns or infections   and neuropathic pain, which is caused by damage to nerve structures, such as pain caused by shingles. In order to classify which pain the patient suffers from, they  fill in several questionnaires and quantify pain intensity of using assessment scales.

The findings are published online in the journal Biological Psychiatry.Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Previous imaging studies have found structural abnormalities in some regions of the brain of bipolar patients. These abnormalities include lower cortical thickness compared with healthy individuals. The cortex, the outer layer of the brain, shrinks naturally as people age but accelerated cortical thinning has been linked to various brain diseases.Most previous neuroimaging studies on bipolar disorder have been small and cross-sectional in design, meaning they captured only one snapshot in time. Thus, there has been a lack of large-scale studies that have examined brain changes over time.In this study, the researchers overcame those shortcomings by collecting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 14 research centers worldwide to examine changes in the brain over a period of up to nine years. The study involved 1,232 individuals, including 307 bipolar disorder patients and 925 healthy controls.When comparing patients with bipolar disorder and healthy individuals, the changes over time significantly differed in three brain regions: the ventricles   cavities that produce cerebrospinal fluid important for the brain s protection   and two areas linked to recognition and memory: the fusiform and the parahippocampal cortex. While bipolar patients showed faster enlargements of the brain s ventricles than the control group, they in fact displayed on average slower thinning of the fusiform and parahippocampal cortical regions.

But stuffing genes into cramped quarters is only half the battle. The DNA must also remain organized, carefully coiled into loops that ensure the information remains readily accessible and not a tangled mess. Now, new research has identified proteins called linker histones as the factor that controls whether DNA winds into long and thin chromosomes, made up of many small loops, or short and thick chromosomes with fewer large loops. The findings, published in eLife, are the first to describe how chromosome shape is tuned by linker histones at the molecular level. The linker histone was once thought to impact only a narrow range of the genetic material,  says Rockefeller s Hironori Funabiki.  We have now shown that it controls the number of loops in the chromosome and its ultimate shape, a much larger regulation space than expected.  ","Published: October 1, 2021"

Philip Robbins, an associate professor and chair of the Department of Philosophy in the MU College of Arts and Science, said these findings can help to narrow a knowledge gap found in both psychology and philosophy, two disciplines that study human behavior. Historically, psychology and philosophy have had a stronger focus on the  dark  side of human behavior, such as moral wrongdoing, and less attention has been placed on studying the  light  side of human behavior, such as acts of altruism,  said Robbins, the principal investigator of the project.  This research aims to provide a better understanding of a relatively neglected aspect of human psychology, the human mind, and the human condition, which concerns how people process and react to positive behaviors, such as giving praise. The research is based on survey results from a total of 974 participants. It builds upon the researchers  previous finding that people tend to think of an adult who has committed a crime as less culpable, and less deserving of punishment, when told that the accused had suffered serious harm in childhood.Robbins said the team s findings are also relevant to thinking about criminal sentencing, particularly in capital trials. Defense counsel often presents evidence of clients  suffering and victimization in their early years, and the authors  previous and current studies support this practice. He added the findings point to a broader issue about how people judge others without knowing who they really are as individuals, since knowing what a person has experienced in life can alter how we assess their good and bad deeds.   It s important that we pay attention to human beings not just as creatures that do bad things to each other, but also as creatures that do good things for each other,  Robbins said.  Part of what s remarkable about our species is our capacity to behave in prosocial ways, such as cooperating with and helping others, as well as antisocial ways, such as competing with and harming them.

We can now visualize these proteins within Drosophila brains while the clocks are ticking,  said Yadlapalli, an assistant professor with the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Michigan Medicine.The internal clock within a fruit fly and a person is generated by the rhythm of the expression of certain genes in response to environmental cues, like light. Some genes are more expressed during the day, while others are more expressed at night.One of the most well-known processes controlled by the circadian rhythm is the sleep-wake cycle. This cycle is due in part to the production of the hormone melatonin, which fluctuates and is highest in the evening, causing drowsiness.Several other bodily processes fluctuate over the 24-hour period, controlled by RNA expression that rises and falls over the 24-hour day. Clocks in all eukaryotes, organisms whose cells carry DNA inside an enveloped nucleus, are based on a simple negative feedback loop. Your cells are making key clock proteins and once you have high enough levels, those proteins enter the nucleus and stop their own mRNA production,  explained Yadlapalli. The fruit fly clock is generated by four proteins called CLOCK, CYCLE, PERIOD and TIMELESS which generate this feedback loop and control the expression of several clock-regulated genes. Using CRISPR to tag a clock gene called per, which codes for PERIOD, the researchers used a high-resolution microscope to observe its oscillations over 24 hours.Her team discovered that PERIOD is surprisingly organized, not randomly distributed within a cell. The proteins produce foci, discrete spheres that are positioned around the edges of the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, during the repression phase when genes are not being expressed. Genes are being moved to the edges of the nucleus within our cells then back again, essentially every 12 hours, every single day  throughout the life of the organism,  Yadlapalli said. This movement regulates the circadian rhythm.The team further observed that flies without a nuclear envelope exhibited abnormal behavior in response to light and dark. If you disrupt this process in these 150 neurons in fly brains, it affects the sleep/wake cycle of the flies,  said Yadlapalli.This study provides fundamental insights into how circadian clocks function at the subcellular level. Says Yadlapalli,  If the clocks are disrupted, which happens in old age and with some mutations, that can lead to many disorders, like sleep and metabolic disorders and even cancer, as clocks control when cells decide to divide.

They say the finding could eventually lead to the development of medical interventions in humans The gene, called retroCHMP3, encodes an altered protein that disrupts the ability of certain viruses to exit an infected cell and prevents it from going on to infect other cells.Normally, some viruses encase themselves in cell membranes and then make an exit by budding off from the host cell. RetroCHMP3 delays that process long enough that the virus can no longer escape. This was an unexpected discovery,  says Nels Elde, Ph.D., senior author of the study and an evolutionary geneticist in the Department of Human Genetics at U of U Health.  We were surprised that slowing down our cell biology just a little bit throws virus replication off its game. The study appears online Sept. 30 in advance of the Oct. 14 issue of Cell.RetroCHMP3 originated as a duplicated copy of a gene called charged multivesicular body protein 3, or CHMP3. While some monkeys, mice, and other animals have retroCHMP3 or other variants, humans only have the original CHMP3.In humans and other creatures, CHMP3 is well known for playing a key part of a role in cellular processes that are vital for maintaining cellular membrane integrity, intercellular signaling, and cell division.HIV and certain other viruses hijack this pathway to bud off from the cellular membrane and infect other cells. Based on their research, Elde and his colleagues suspected that the duplications of CHMP3 they discovered in primates and mice blocked this from happening as protection against viruses like HIV and other viral diseases.Building on this notion, Elde and other scientists began exploring whether variants of retroCHMP3 might work as an antiviral. In laboratory experiments conducted elsewhere, a shorter, altered version of human CHMP3 successfully prevented HIV from budding off cells. But there was a glitch: the modified protein also disrupted important cellular functions, causing the cells to die. Unlike the other researchers, Elde and his colleagues at U of U Health had naturally occurring variants of CHMP3 from other animals in hand. So, working in collaboration with researchers Sanford Simon at The Rockefeller University, along with Phuong Tieu Schmitt and Anthony Schmitt at Pennsylvania State University, they tried a different approach.Using genetic tools, they coaxed human cells to produce the version of retroCHMP3 found in squirrel monkeys. Then, they infected the cells with HIV and found that the virus had difficulty budding off from the cells, essentially stopping them in their tracks. And this occurred without disrupting metabolic signaling or related cellular functions that can cause cell death.  We re excited about the work because we showed some time ago that many different enveloped viruses use this pathway, called the ESCRT pathway, to escape cells,  says Wes Sundquist, Ph.D., a co-corresponding author of the study and chair of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Utah.  We always thought that this might be a point at which cells could defend themselves against such viruses, but we didn t see how that could happen without interfering with other very important cellular functions. From an evolutionary perspective, Elde believes this represents a new type of immunity that can arise quickly to protect against short-lived threats. We thought the ESCRT pathway was an Achilles heel that viruses like HIV and Ebola could always exploit as they bud off and infect new cells,  Elde says.  RetroCHMP3 flipped the script, making the viruses vulnerable. Moving forward, we hope to learn from this lesson and use it to counter viral diseases. More specifically, that lesson  raises the possibility that an intervention that slows down the process may be inconsequential for the host, but provide us with a new anti-retroviral,  says Sanford Simon, Ph.D, a study co-author and  a professor of Cellular Biophysics at The Rockefeller University.Reference: Rheinemann L, Downhour DM, Bredbenner K, et al.

Now, a  time machine  built by Purdue University engineers has shown a way to reverse the course of cancer before it spreads throughout the pancreas. These findings open up the possibility of designing a new gene therapy or drug because now we can convert cancerous cells back into their normal state,  said Bumsoo Han, a Purdue professor of mechanical engineering and program leader of the Purdue Center for Cancer Research. Han has a courtesy appointment in biomedical engineering.The time machine that Han s lab built is a lifelike reproduction of a pancreatic structure called the acinus, which produces and secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine. Pancreatic cancer tends to develop from chronic inflammation that happens when a mutation has caused these digestive enzymes to digest the pancreas itself.If there were a way to go back in time to reprogram the cancerous acinar cells that produce those enzymes, then it might be possible to completely reset the pancreas.For the past decade, Stephen Konieczny, professor emeritus in Purdue s Department of Biological Sciences, has studied a potential reset button: a gene called PTF1a. The PTF1a gene is absolutely critical for normal pancreas development. If you lack the PTF1a gene, you don t develop a pancreas,  Konieczny said.  So, our whole idea was, if we turn the PTF1a gene back on in a pancreatic cancer cell, what happens? Will we revert the cancer phenotype? Indeed, that s exactly what happens. Konieczny collaborated with Han s lab to take these findings in molecular biology studies to the next level by testing them in a realistic model of the acinus   the time machine. The published study is featured on the cover of the Oct. 7 issue of Lab on a Chip, a journal by the Royal Society of Chemistry.Researchers typically investigate possible pancreatic cancer treatment approaches in animal models, but it can take months for pancreatic cancer to develop in an animal. Having a way to study cancer development and treatment concepts in a microenvironment that is just as realistic would save time and give researchers more control over the model.The model that Purdue researchers developed overcomes a major challenge in accurately capturing the anatomical complexity of the acinus, a circular cavity lined with cells. From an engineering perspective, creating this kind of three-dimensional cavity is not trivial. So, figuring out a way to build this cavity is an innovation in itself,  Han said.Han s lab already had experience building a realistic model of another pancreatic structure, the duct, where cancer grows after emerging from the acinus. The researchers took this knowledge and developed a new technique that builds both the duct and acinus in a two-step  viscous fingering  process.Here s how it works: The model, a postage stamp-size glass platform on top of a microscope slide, has two interconnected chambers. Loading a collagen solution into one chamber fills the finger-like shape of a pancreatic duct, which bulges and then expands to create the cavity structure of the acinus in the second chamber.Dropping cancerous human cells into the acinar chamber made the model even more realistic. Konieczny s lab engineered the PTF1a gene of a pancreatic cancer cell line to turn on in the presence of doxycycline, a compound commonly used in antibiotics. Once the gene was activated, the cells started constructing the rest of the acinus in Han s model, indicating that they were no longer cancerous and had been reprogrammed. In this model, not only do the cancerous cells become reprogrammed, but for the first time, we re able to show the normal three-dimensional architecture of the acinus, which looks very similar to the same structures we see in a healthy pancreas,  Konieczny said.Han s lab is currently conducting experiments exploring a possible gene therapy based on these findings.This study was partially supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Walther Embedding Program in Physical Sciences in Oncology, and the Purdue Center for Cancer Research, which is one of only seven National Cancer Institute Basic Laboratory Cancer Centers in the nation.Reference: Venis SM, Moon H, Yang Y, Utturkar SM, Konieczny SF, Han B.

The research shows the proportion of pregnant COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization increased to 10 to 15% in late August and early September, more than double the percentage of last year before the emergence of the Delta variant. This is a concerning trend, and we re primarily seeing these cases in unvaccinated women,  said Emily Adhikari, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and a lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.Dr. Adhikari said the findings offer the first objective evidence that the case number and severity of illness in pregnant women rose with a spike in the Delta variant. The study included 1,515 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 who received care from Parkland Health & Hospital System   Dallas County s public hospital   from May 2020 through Sept. 4, 2021.Overall, 82 patients had severe or critical illness, including 10 requiring ventilators, and two deaths. The proportion of severe or critical cases was around 5% until after the new year, and were then largely nonexistent in February and most of March.However, the rise of the Delta variant coincided with a new wave of hospitalizations that peaked this August and early September, including more than a third of COVID-19 cases the week of Aug. 29. By this time, genetic sequencing conducted at UT Southwestern showed nearly all the local variants sequenced were the Delta B.1.617.2 strain.Of the 82 patients hospitalized since May 2020, all but one were unvaccinated.Dr. Adhikari acknowledged that some women fear the vaccine may not be safe to take during pregnancy, but said research has debunked those concerns. She co-authored a JAMA article earlier this year that elaborated on the issue of vaccines and pregnancy.Dr. Adhikari said pregnant women are at greater risk for complications with any type of severe respiratory infection, so these findings further emphasize the need for pregnant and lactating women in all communities to get vaccinated for COVID-19. If they are exposed and infected, they run a higher risk of severe illness from this most recent Delta variant,  said Dr. Adhikari, Medical Director of Perinatal Infectious Diseases at Parkland.  Pregnant women should get immunized as soon as possible. The genomic sequencing that revealed nearly all the local SARS-CoV-2 variants were Delta was performed in the McDermott Center Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Core with analysis performed by the McDermott Bioinformatics Lab, both under the supervision of Helen H. Hobbs, M.D., a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics, who directs the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development at UT Southwestern.

The idea, that mGluR5 stimulates excessive protein synthesis in fragile X neurons that disrupts their functions, became well validated by experiments in his lab and others worldwide using several animal models of the disease. There was great anticipation that this would be a breakthrough treatment for this disease,  said Bear, a faculty member of The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.  Thus, it was a profound disappointment when the first human clinical trials using mGluR5 negative modulators failed to show a benefit. This finding led many to question the theory or the usefulness of the animal models, Bear acknowledged. But now a new study in mice provides substantial evidence that this promising treatment for fragile X syndrome missed the mark because the brain builds up resistance, or  tolerance  to it. Importantly, the research also points to several new therapeutic opportunities that could still turn the tide against fragile X, the most common inherited form of autism.Bear and his team led by postdoc David Stoppel showed that giving just a few doses early in life while the brain is still developing and then not giving further doses as they got older, could produce lasting benefits in cognitive ability. That finding suggests that the timing and duration of mGluR5 inhibition are more important than previously recognized. The development of acquired treatment resistance to a medication is nothing new,  said Bear, senior author of the new paper in Frontiers in Psychiatry.  The fact that it happens doesn t mean that, therefore, you give up all hope. It means that you have to be aware of it. In addition to the strategy of administering mGluR5 inhibitors at a young age and then stopping, the study also implies that patients could benefit if dosing were structured with breaks to prevent a buildup of resistance, Bear said. Moreover, the study also suggests that amid treatment resistance fragile X mice resumed synthesis of an unknown protein that leads to symptoms. Identifying and targeting that protein, Bear added, could also be a fertile new avenue for drug development.These new findings follow on a 2020 study in Science Translational Medicine (STM) by Bear s lab and scientists at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in which they developed a compound, BRD0705, that acts downstream in the molecular pathway between mGluR5 and protein synthesis. BRD0705 did not incur treatment resistance in mature fragile X mice.","Published: September 30, 2021"

As a result, scientists have been working to understand the mechanism behind how the damage to hearing actually occurs.Now, a team led by researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) has published an online interactive atlas representing the changes in the levels of RNA made in the different cell types of ears of mice, after damage due to loud noise. These changes in RNA levels are known as changes in  gene expression. Once they determined the larger trends in gene expression following the damage, the UMSOM scientists then searched a database of FDA-approved drugs to find those that are known to produce opposite patterns of those caused by the noise. From this analysis, the research teams identified a handful of drug candidates that may be able to prevent or treat the damage, and ultimately preserve hearing.Their analysis was published in Cell Reports on September 28. As an otolaryngologist surgeon-scientist, I see patients with hearing loss due to age or noise damage, and I want to be able to help prevent or even reverse the damage to their hearing,  said study leader Ronna Hertzano, MD, PhD, Professor of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Anatomy and Neurobiology at UMSOM and Affiliate Member of UMSOM s Institute for Genome Sciences.  Our extended analysis gives us very specific avenues to follow up on in future studies, as well as provides an encyclopedia that other researchers can use as a resource to study hearing loss. The team added their newest data on noise-induced hearing loss to gEAR  Gene Expression Analysis Resource  a tool developed by her laboratory that allows researchers not trained in informatics to browse gene expression data (published earlier this summer).Dr. Hertzano explained that the inner ear resembles the shell of a snail, with separate fluid compartments and sensory cells along its entire length. The ear functions like a battery with a gradient of ions between the fluid compartments that is generated by the side wall of the shell by adding in potassium. The sensory cells detect sound and then communicate with the neurons that interact with the brain to interpret the signal. The sensory cells are surrounded by support cells. The inner ear also has resident immune cells to protect it from infection.Research Supervisor Beatrice Milon, PhD, in Dr. Hertzano s laboratory initially did an analysis on the sensory cells and the support cells of the ear in mice. She collected data on the changes in gene expression from before and after noise damage. After making their study known to other researchers in their field, the team heard from scientists at Decibel Therapeutics (led by Joe Burns, PhD) and the Karolinska Institute (led by Barbara Canlon, PhD), who had the gene expression data from the inner ear s neurons, side wall and immune cells from before and after noise damage. The teams then combined the datasets and performed their analysis.The bioinformatic analyses were led by Eldad Shulman, MA, MS, from the lab of Ran Elkon, PhD, Tel Aviv University, a bioinformatics expert that has been working collaboratively with Dr. Hertzano now for over two decades. Together, they leverage advanced computational techniques and combine them with biological insights to analyze and interpret data, providing impactful insights to the hearing research field.Dr. Hertzano says it was so important that they looked at a cell specific level, rather than looking at the entire ear because they found that most of the gene expression changes were specific to only one or two cell types. We expected the subset of neurons typically sensitive to noise and aging, to have  bad  changes in genes, so that we could counter them with drugs, but there was no such thing,  said Dr. Hertzano.  On the contrary, we found that the subset of neurons that are resistant to noise trauma, turn on a program that protects them while the very sensitive neurons had little change in gene expression. We are currently looking into approaches to induce the protective changes in the noise-sensitive neurons to prevent their loss from noise and aging. In another example, the researchers found that only one out of the four types of immune cells detected showed major differences in gene expression.Additionally, immune-related genes were turned up in all cell types of the inner ear after noise damage with many of them controlled by two key regulators.The research team took the overall gene expression trends and plugged them into DrugCentral, a database of known molecular responses to FDA-approved drugs, specifically searching for changes that would be opposite of those happening in the noise-damaged cells. They identified the diabetes drug metformin as a potential candidate, as well as some inhaled anesthetic medications used in surgeries and other medications. Hearing aids and cochlear implants are used to alleviate hearing loss, however, there are no therapies available to prevent or treat hearing loss,  said E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor, and Dean, UMSOM. The studies that follow up on these findings may eventually lead to medications to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss, for example in factory workers, and to changes in standardizing anesthesia protocols for ear surgery, particularly in hearing preservation procedures.

The same is often true for neurons in the brain. But the same way a cell phone allows two people to communicate clearly across the room, new research at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) opened up a new channel of communication in the worm C. elegans brain.The research, published in Nature Communications, highlights the development of HySyn, a system designed to synthetically reconnect neural circuits using neuropeptides from Hydra, a small, freshwater organism. (Neuropeptides modulate the activity of neurotransmitters to increase or decrease the strength of impulses between neurons.)For the first time, the researchers created genetic lines of mutant C. elegans that expressed neuropeptides from the Hydra brain, creating an artificial synapse that rewired a behavioral circuit in the worm. Because none of the other synapses in the brain, besides those fitted with the hydra receptor and neuropeptide, could hear the  command,  it was like giving them a cell phone so they could communicate. These neuromodulatory peptides let you communicate at a distance,  said MBL Fellow Daniel Col n-Ramos of Yale University School of Medicine.  It gives you more flexibility as a researcher to manipulate neurons that are not adjacent to each other.  Col n-Ramos, senior author on the paper, was postdoctoral advisor for the paper s first author, former MBL Grass Fellow Josh Hawk. The work and analysis was performed at the MBL and at Yale University in Col n-Ramos s lab.The researchers used a mutant line of C. elegans that was missing the neural connection that controlled specific behavior   the behavior that told them that they were full and needed to stop searching for food. By taking genes that encode a neuropeptide and its receptor from Hydra and putting them into the C. elegans worm, researchers were able to restore the neural circuit that controls this behavior. They created two separate genetic lines one that contained the neuropeptide and one that contained the receptor. The offspring of the pair contained the full neural peptide pathway. But, according to Hawk, it s just one possible pathway to focus on. There are hundreds of neural peptides in Hydra, each of which could be a different channel of communication,  said Hawk.  To me, that s the most exciting thing. This should open up a whole area that no one has ever explored before. Hawk called this study a  proof of principle  for the HySyn tool. Unlike most organisms, Hydra don t have a classic neurotransmitter system in the brain. Instead, they rely completely on a net of neuropeptides. Each of these Hydra neuropeptides has the opportunity for a unique line of communication. Hawk focused on a particular neuropeptide that creates a slow-building signal, like the slow-building sensation of fullness as you eat a meal. Connecting different neurons with this neuropeptide could create a slowly rising pain response or strengthen a new memory.There are many different types of communication in the brain. Some are fast, on the order of milliseconds. But others are slower. That s what Hawk was focusing on, the slow neuromodulatory response that told the C. elegans:  I m full, don t go seek out new food.  The researchers created an artificial, neuromodulatory synapse that told the C. elegans it was time to relax. Usually, we can break things in science. That s very powerful. When we break things we can see what they are necessary for, which also tells us a little about how they work. But to really understand how they work, you want to know if you can rebuild them fix them after they are broken. And that is very hard to do,  said Col n-Ramos.  That [Hawk] could rebuild the connections between cells was very exciting and innovative. Hawk wasn t just putting back missing components in the C. elegans brain; he was putting in entirely new components from Hydra   fixing what was broken with a different set of parts. It showed the researchers that it wasn t necessarily the identity of the parts themselves, but the communication and modulation between the synapses that regulated the behavior.Hawk said he hopes future research focuses on knocking out lines of communication in the brain and rebuilding them in a different way with HySyn.   This is the beginning of a set of tools, and as those tools are expanded, it gives us a real ability to tweak connections in the brain in a variety of permutations,  he said. There s a lot of diversity of synaptic connection in any animal s brain. Being able to pick and choose what to put in another organism will help us untangle and understand how and why brains do what they do,  said Hawk.The researchers are confident that HySyn will work in a variety of organisms. They tested it in vertebrate cells as well as in C. elegans.Hawk added that he hopes researchers will focus on learning about the strength of connections within the brain.  In theory, can you tear down the worm brain and then rebuild it and find out what is lost when you rebuild it certain ways. It s what we did as kids: If you want to know how something works, you break it down and rebuild it. But we need more tools to do that.  HySin  represents a contribution to that toolset.In addition to his time as a Grass Fellow in 2019, Hawk was faculty member for the MBL s Neural Systems and Behavior (NS&B) course from 2015-2019. Josh was able to leverage knowledge from the MBL and the people he met and put all that knowledge together, with his own interests in neuroscience, and make a significant contribution.  This is what programs like the Grass Fellowship and MBL help catalyze in science,  said Col n-Ramos. It s like an emblematic MBL project,  Colon-Ramos said.  High risk, high reward. Lots of fun and bringing in a lot of knowledge from the MBL community. Reference: Hawk JD, Wisdom EM, Sengupta T, Kashlan ZD, Col n-Ramos DA.

But how the polymers and additives in these materials influence this process is a mystery. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology show that additives in commercial shopping bags boost sunlight s ability to convert these solid materials into thousands of dissolved compounds within days.Once plastic pollution gets into the environment, its fate is still largely unknown, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Some of the plastic items, such as polyethylene shopping bags, float in water, which exposes them directly to the sun s rays. Previous researchers have shown that the pure polymers commonly used to make these items produce water-soluble molecules and gases when placed in ultraviolet light, a component of sunlight. However, plastics in consumer goods aren t pure; a variety of carbon-based organic additives and mineral additives are mixed in to give them color or make them more stable. So, Collin Ward and colleagues wanted to see exactly how the composition of single-use shopping bags influenced the dissolved compounds generated by sunlight over short periods.With X-ray diffraction, the researchers examined four polyethylene plastic bags from big-box retailers and a pure polyethylene polymer film for mineral additives. No additives were identified in the pure polymer, but calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide were found in three of the bags, and only calcium carbonate was found in the fourth bag. Next, the researchers put pieces of the plastic bags and the polymer into separate containers with water, and then in the dark or under simulated daylight for up to a week. Some water-soluble compounds were released from the different pieces in the dark. But in sunlight, more compounds were released, ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 dissolved compounds, which equates to 1.1-fold to 50-fold increases over the number of compounds released in the dark. Of the approximately 9,000 molecules generated by the pure polymer when exposed to sunlight, only about a quarter overlapped with those from the bags. Based on these results, the researchers say that sunlight s reactions with solid plastics can transform them into a plethora of water-soluble compounds whose levels and identities vary, depending on the additives used.Reference: Walsh AN, Reddy CM, Niles SF, McKenna AM, Hansel CM, Ward CP.

The first key step in infection is when the virus  spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on human cells. Researchers at Penn State have created a novel framework that can predict with reasonable accuracy the amino-acid changes in the virus  spike protein that may improve its binding to human cells and confer increased infectivity to the virus.The tool could enable the computational surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and provide advance warning of potentially dangerous variants with an even higher binding affinity potential. This can aid in the early implementation of public health measures to prevent the virus s spread and perhaps even may inform vaccine booster formulations. Emerging variants could potentially be highly contagious in humans and other animals,  said Suresh Kuchipudi, clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences and associate director of the Animal Diagnostic Lab, Penn State.  Therefore, it is critical to proactively assess what amino acid changes may likely increase the infectiousness of the virus. Our framework is a powerful tool for determining the impact of amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that affect the ability of the virus to bind to ACE2 receptors in humans and multiple animal species. The team used a novel, two-step computational procedure to create a model for predicting which changes in amino acids   molecules linked together to form proteins   may occur in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 s spike protein that could affect its ability to bind to the ACE2 receptors of human and other animal cells.According to Kuchipudi, the currently circulating variants include one or more mutations that have led to amino-acid changes in the RBD of the spike protein. These amino-acid changes may have conferred fitness advantages and increased infectivity through a variety of mechanisms,  he said.  Increased binding affinity of the RBD of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor is one such mechanism. Kuchipudi explained that the spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor is the first and crucial step in viral entry to the cell. The binding strength between RBD and ACE2 directly affects infection dynamics and potentially disease progression,  he said.  The ability to reliably predict the effects of virus amino-acid changes in the ability of its RBD to interact more strongly with the ACE2 receptor can help in assessing public health implications and the potential for spillover and adaptation into humans and other animals. Costas D. Maranas, Donald B. Broughton Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Penn State, led the development of the team s new two-step procedure. First, the researchers tested the predictive power of a technique, called Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) analysis, to quantify the binding affinity of the RBD for ACE2. MM-GBSA analysis sums up multiple types of energy contributions associated with the virus s RBD  sticking  to the human ACE2 receptor. Using data from already existing variants, the team found that this technique was only partially able to predict the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s RBD for ACE2.Therefore, Maranas and the team explored the use of the energy terms from the MM-GBSA analysis as features in a neural network regression model   a type of deep-learning algorithm   and trained the model using experimentally available data on binding in variants with single amino acid changes. They found that they could predict with more than 80% accuracy whether certain amino acid changes improved or worsened binding affinity for the dataset explored. This combined MM-GBSA with a neural network model approach appears to be quite effective at predicting the effect of amino acid changes not used during model training,  said Maranas.  The model also allowed for the prediction of the binding strength of various already observed SARS-CoV-2 amino acid changes seen in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. This may provide the computational means for predicting such affinities in yet-to-be discovered variants. Nevertheless, even though our computational tool can find amino acid changes that boost binding affinity even further, they have not yet been observed in circulating variants. This may mean that such changes could interfere with other requirements of productive virus infection. It is a reminder that binding with the ACE2 receptor is not the complete story.     The findings published today (Sept. 29) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Our method sets up a framework for screening for binding affinity changes resulting from unknown single and multiple amino acid changes; therefore, offering a valuable tool to assess currently circulating and prospectively future viral variants in terms of their affinity for ACE2 and greater infectiousness,  said Maranas.Kuchipudi added,  SARS-CoV-2 can switch hosts as a result of increased contact between the virus and potential new hosts. This tool can help make sense of the enormous virus sequence data generated by genomic surveillance. In particular, it may help determine if the virus can adapt and spread among agricultural animals, thereby informing targeted mitigation measures. Reference: Chen C, Boorla VS, Banerjee D, et al.

In romantic couples, this positive effect has been linked to a mutual alignment of brain activity and heart rhythms.  Since touch is a fundamental mode of communication between caregiver and infant, Trinh Nguyen, Stefanie H hl and colleagues from the US asked whether proximity and touch also contribute to the attunement of brain and heart rhythms between mother and baby.In the new study, four to six-month-old babies played and watched videos together with their mothers. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure brain activity while electrocardiography (ECG) was used to simultaneously assess the heart rhythms of mother and baby. With fNIRS, changes in oxygen saturation are recorded in the outermost layer of the brain - here in particular in the frontal brain. Activation in this region is associated with mutual emotional attunement, attentiveness and self-regulation. These processes are particularly relevant for social interactions and develop during the first years.The results showed that mother-baby pairs mutually adjusted their brain activity, especially when they touched each other. Mutual neural adjustment occurred when the mother held the baby close to her body and both watched a video together, and when they played together face-to-face and the mother lovingly touched the baby, e.g., by kissing, stroking and gentle massage. The new study demonstrates that touch plays a fundamental role in the early adaptation of brain activity between mothers and infants. An adaptation of heart rhythms was also shown when mother and baby played together, but it was independent of touch. In the case of the heartbeat, a mutual adaptation was particularly evident when babies signalled discomfort, which was presumably transmitted to the mothers.In future studies, Trinh Nguyen and Stefanie H hl want to investigate how the mutual attunement in brain activity and heart rhythms affects child development in the long term. In particular, the later relationship between mother and child, as well as children s language development, will be investigated in follow-up studies.Reference: Nguyen T, Abney DH, Salamander D, Bertenthal BI, Hoehl S.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/potential-therapeutic-targets-for-sepsis-identified-354242,Potential Therapeutic Targets for Sepsis Identified Researchers have identified molecular biomarkers  pathways and immune cell dynamics associated with sepsis that could be targeted to prevent the condition from leading to death  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Sepsis, the body s life-threatening response to infection affecting about 1.7 million adults in the United States each year, can lead to multisystem organ failure with a high mortality rate. No targeted therapeutics against this condition have been developed in the last decades. Now, however, a team led by biomedical scientists at the University of California, Riverside, offers some hope for future treatment during sepsis awareness month.The researchers, led by Meera Nair and Adam Godzik in the School of Medicine, identified molecular biomarkers, pathways and immune cell dynamics associated with sepsis that could be therapeutically targeted to prevent the condition from leading to death. These blood cell biomarkers   the protein CD52 in lymphocytes; and the protein S100A9 involved in inflammatory processes   are present in all blood cells but highly expressed in people with sepsis. How these biomarkers change early in sepsis   specifically, within the first six hours   could determine whether the patient survives or dies.  These biomarkers were found to uniquely change within six hours in the blood of patients with sepsis and affected specific cellular pathways in specific immune cells,  said Nair, an associate professor of biomedical sciences, who co-led the study published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology.  Changes in CD52 expression were associated with good outcomes, which means promoting the activation of protective immune cells. S100A9, on the other hand, acted as a molecular driver of fatal sepsis. We appear to have found a molecular driver and a molecular protector of sepsis. According to Nair, the team also found the molecular pathways for fatal sepsis and COVID-19 converge.  Severe COVID appears to trigger molecular pathways identical to sepsis,  she said.  Further analysis of these pathways can help us diagnose and treat both diseases. In particular, the research team also found that in people with sepsis, blood platelets   cell types involved in normal blood flow and coagulation   lost their function, as they do in COVID patients. The researchers argue that if the platelets  function could be restored by targeting the main regulators of this process, it could promote survival in both sepsis and COVID. Nair explained that when a patient is diagnosed with sepsis and admitted to the intensive care unit, physicians use clinical scoring systems, such as the APACHE-2 and SOFA scores, to help predict severity of illness and probability of mortality. Clinicians still cannot predict whether the patient is going to survive or die and what specific treatment to give that may improve their survival chances,  she said.  There is no way, unfortunately, of triaging the patients to figure out if they would benefit from one treatment versus another. We wanted to address this by finding molecular biomarkers that are better predictors of whether a patient survives or dies. We appear to have found some candidates. The study, done in partnership with clinicians at the Riverside University Health System, or RUHS, involved sampling the blood of five patients with sepsis. Dr. Walter Klein, the paper s co-author and a pulmonologist at RUHS, noted clinical scoring systems do not provide specific therapeutic targets for patients.  From a clinical perspective, the treatment of sepsis largely focuses on early recognition, early systemic antibiotics/source control of the infection, and support of failing organ systems,  he said.  What is missing in the clinical arena are specific therapies that reverse the patient s dysregulated immune response to infection. The importance of basic science research like this is to hopefully find individualized treatments one day where we can rapidly reverse the patient s multi-organ failure and prevent mortality. Unlike other studies that analyzed blood samples from patients with sepsis at time zero, when patients are first diagnosed with the disease, the research team analyzed blood samples of sepsis patients at time zero and six hours later   two different time points from differing outcomes in sepsis. We have snapshots in two time-steps that show us how the biomarkers are evolving,  said Godzik, the Bruce D. and Nancy B. Varner Presidential Endowed Chair in Cancer Research at UCR and a professor of biomedical sciences, who co-led the study.  We can enhance this evolution in the right direction, toward survival. If the patient is heading in the wrong direction, toward fatality, we can intervene to change the trajectory of the disease. With this work, we have gone beyond the static snapshot and moved into a more dynamic process. Blood samples obtained from RUHS were processed at a single-cell sequencer at UCR, allowing the researchers to understand the behavior of each cell rather than an average of all cells.  We found that many cell types behaved differently in sepsis,  said Xinru Qiu, the co-first author of the paper and a graduate student in Godzik s lab.  Using single cell sequencing, we could separately track the trajectory of different cell types. Single-cell resolution is like having a street-level view of an area versus a satellite view of it, and an understanding of what each cell contributes were key in helping us find our results. According to Godzik, when news reports note someone has died of complications from an infection, it generally means the person died of sepsis.  Thirty percent of all deaths in hospitals are caused by sepsis,  he said.  Sepsis is an unmet need with no treatment. Our work offers a path to treatment because we have extended the view from single molecules to processes in cells. After all, it is the molecular pathways involved that can be interrupted. Oftentimes, people think if a gene is a biomarker of a disease, a drug should target it. Well, not necessarily. If the bumper of your car   the tag or marker   is destroyed in a car accident, you may have need to fix the brakes   the pathway. Nair stressed that the study was possible only through a multidisciplinary approach.  As an immunologist, I teamed up with Adam, who is a computational biologist, and with RUHS clinicians,  she said.   It s only through such collaborative work that we can start to unravel the complexity of fatal sepsis, offering insight into new treatments that could change the trajectory of sepsis patients who may face a fatal outcome. Next, the researchers plan to focus on similarities between sepsis and COVID-19 and have already begun research funded by the Center for Health Disparities Research at UCR.  We are doing a molecular analysis of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune homeostasis,  Nair said.  We would like to see if our sepsis research findings could apply also to COVID-19.

The findings appear in Science Advances. It s been known for about a decade that patients with low-grade gliomas that have this IDH1 mutation have a much longer median survival,  said the study s co-senior author Maria Castro, Ph.D., a professor of neurosurgery and cell and developmental biology at U-M.  We set out to try to understand why, and to see if there were any differences that could be harnessed to improve outcomes more broadly. In a mouse model of glioma without the IDH1 mutation, administering G-CSF, the blood growth factor produced by their mutant cousins, more than doubled median survival times. When immunotherapy was also added in, the effect was even more profound, the study found.Even low-grade gliomas are uniformly fatal, eventually coming back after treatment with some combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. It's an inescapable destiny, so we really need new therapies,  Castro said.","Published: September 30, 2021"

The Kidney Project, a nationwide collaboration led by Shuvo Roy, PhD of UC San Francisco and William Fissell, MD of Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), combined the two essential parts of its artificial kidney, the hemofilter and the bioreactor, and successfully implanted the smartphone-sized device for preclinical evaluation.For this advance, the team was awarded KidneyX s Phase 1 Artificial Kidney Prize and was one of six winning teams selected out of an international field.In the last few years, The Kidney Project successfully tested the hemofilter, which removes waste products and toxins from blood, and the bioreactor, which replicates other kidney functions, like the balance of electrolytes in blood, in separate experiments.For the Artificial Kidney Prize, the team married the two units into a scaled-down version of the artificial kidney and evaluated its performance in a preclinical model. The units worked in tandem, powered by blood pressure alone, and without the need for blood thinning or immunosuppressant drugs. The vision for the artificial kidney is to provide patients with complete mobility and better physiological outcomes than dialysis,  said Roy, who is a faculty member in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, a joint department of the UCSF Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine.  It promises a much higher quality of life for millions worldwide with kidney failure. Chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease, leads to the progressive and dangerous loss of kidney function. Most patients with kidney failure must visit dialysis clinics multiple times every week to have their blood filtered, a process that is time-consuming, uncomfortable, and risky.A minority of patients live with transplanted kidneys, thanks to a pool of donated kidneys that are constantly in high demand. But even these patients must contend with a lifetime on immunosuppressant drugs that can have severe side effects.The Kidney Project s artificial kidney will not only replicate the high quality of life seen in kidney transplant recipients the  gold standard  of kidney disease treatment, according to Roy but also spare them from needing to take immunosuppressants. Our team engineered the artificial kidney to sustainably support a culture of human kidney cells without provoking an immune response,  said Roy.  Now that we have demonstrated the feasibility of combining the hemofilter and bioreactor, we can focus on upscaling the technology for more rigorous preclinical testing, and ultimately, clinical trials. The KidneyX Artificial Kidney Prize called on scientists and engineers to submit  continuous kidney replacement therapies that provide transformational treatment options beyond current dialysis methods,  a high bar that UCSF s artificial kidney is poised to clear in the coming years. This award is a testament to The Kidney Project s bold vision and execution of a viable solution for millions of patients with kidney failure,  said UCSF School of Pharmacy Dean B.

This is the first U.S. study to evaluate the impact of stress on peoples  periods. The study surveyed more than 200 women and people who menstruate in the United States between July and August 2020 in order to better understand how stress during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced their menstrual cycles. More than half (54%) of the individuals in the study experienced changes in their menstrual cycle following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Individuals who experienced higher levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to experience heavier menstrual bleeding and a longer duration of their period, compared to individuals with moderate stress levels, the study found. The study,  Impact of Stress on Menstrual Cyclicity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey Study,  was published Sept. 28 in the Journal of Women s Health. It provides a better understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted women s mental and reproductive health, the study authors said.  We know added stress can negatively impact our overall health and well-being, but for women and people who menstruate, stress can also disrupt normal menstrual cycle patterns and overall reproductive health,  said lead and corresponding author Nicole Woitowich, research assistant professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Prior research has found that menstrual cycle irregularities are often reported by women who experience mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, or by those who are facing acute life stressors such as natural disasters, displacement, famine or defection. Given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and its significant impact on mental health, this data is unsurprising and confirms many anecdotal reports in the popular press and on social media,  Woitowich said. Since the onset of the pandemic, social media has been one of the major platforms where women and people who menstruate could share questions or concerns about their menstrual cycles. Only recently have these concerns been addressed by the biomedical research community.   Reproductive health should not be ignored in the context of COVID-19,  Woitowich said.  We are already seeing the ripple effects of what happens when we fail to consider this important facet of women s health as many are now experiencing menstrual cycle irregularities as a result of the COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 infection.

Part of the motivation for this  synthetic biology  research is to understand more about the evolution and the logic of the natural biology we ve inherited. But there s also a very practical motivation: Cells can be used as efficient factories for making a broad array of useful molecules especially protein-based therapeutics, which account for an increasing share of new medicines. Cells working with an expanded genetic code could make a much more diverse set of such medicines and could do so in a way that greatly simplifies the overall process of developing and manufacturing them.The realization of the grand goal of a working, useful synthetic biology is still some years off. But in a study published this week in Nature Communications, scientists have taken a significant step closer to it, by developing and demonstrating key components of an expanded genetic code system.  We ve supplemented the synthetic biology toolkit to streamline investigations into genetic code expansion,  says study senior author Ahmed Badran, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research.The natural genetic code underlying life on Earth is used by cells to translate information contained in DNA and RNA into the amino-acid building blocks of proteins. DNA and RNA molecules are chain-like molecules that encode information using an  alphabet  of four nucleotide building blocks, or  letters.  Molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decode this information by recognizing three letters at a time, translating each three-letter  codon  into a single amino-acid building block of a protein. This triplet codon system in principle can encode 64 different amino acids (43) yet typically only 20 amino acids are used in most organisms.By contrast, the envisioned quadruplet system, based on four-letter codons, could encode 256 (44) distinct amino acids. Obviously, most of those would not exist in natural proteins, although some could be slight variations on natural amino acids, enabling proteins to be made with much more finely tuned characteristics, for example to optimize their effectiveness and safety as medicines.The enormous challenge here comes from the fact that the system of gene-to-protein translation is a complex one in which multiple components must work together smoothly. The system that exists in living organisms on Earth presumably took many millions of years to evolve to its present levels of accuracy and efficiency. Prior efforts to engineer whole new systems, including quadruplet-codon systems, have shown some promise in recent years.In the new study, Badran and his team used an evolutionary, survival-of-the-fittest, technique called directed evolution to evolve a small set of tRNAs that in principle could work in a quadruplet system. The scientists showed that these quadruplet tRNAs could be used to translate segments of a protein within bacterial cells. They were able to translate six identical quadruplet codons after one another, and even translate four very different quadruplet codons in the same protein and could do so at efficiencies that are for the first time within striking distance of what would be needed for a functional quadruplet system.Badran emphasizes that although a quadruplet code system is still very much in the early, methods-development stage, it should be very useful if it can be made to work especially in enabling the straightforward synthesis of proteins with  non-canonical  amino acids that aren t found naturally in proteins. Such ncAAs, as they are called, could be used to give proteins novel biological properties, including the provision of convenient, safe  handles  on a protein for the placing of chemical modifications to improve the protein s therapeutic properties, for example, or for the attachment of a toxic  warhead  on a tumor-homing cancer drug. One could theoretically program a sequence of DNA that would be translated, in a living cell, into a protein that contains a complex set of modifications modifications that otherwise would be difficult or impossible to add,  Badran says.Reference: DeBenedictis EA, Carver GD, Chung CZ, S ll D, Badran AH.

The awards are intended to fuel vaccine research for a diverse family of coronaviruses, with a primary focus on potential pandemic-causing coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. The available COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be remarkably effective at protecting against severe disease and death,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  These new awards are designed to look ahead and prepare for the next generation of coronaviruses with pandemic potential. The new awards are funded by NIAID s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and its Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation through the Emergency Awards Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) on Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine Development Program Projects. The notice was issued in November 2020 while many SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were still under development because a critical need remained for prophylactic vaccines offering broad protective immunity against other coronaviruses, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV).The awards are designed to fund multidisciplinary teams at each institution to conduct research focused on incorporating understanding of coronavirus virology and immunology, immunogen design, and innovative vaccine and adjuvant platforms and technologies to discover, design, and develop pan-coronavirus vaccine candidates that provide broad protective immunity to multiple coronavirus strains. Specific programs will address coronavirus diversity and infectious potential in humans, include innovative immunogen design and vaccine platforms, and approaches to elicit potent and durable pan-coronavirus immunity, and evaluate vaccine candidates in preclinical models. The awardees are expected to be flexible in the response to emerging knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and infection and factor in new information as vaccines candidates are developed. Additional awards are expected to be issued under the NOSI in 2022 to support pan-coronavirus vaccine research at more institutions.The new awards build on the $1.2 billion investment NIAID has made in coronavirus vaccine research since the COVID-19 pandemic began, including multiple projects in pan-coronavirus vaccine research in the NIAID intramural and extramural programs.A key goal of the initiative is to develop multivalent vaccine platforms and strategies suitable for use in vulnerable populations and to understand vaccine-induced responses and efficacy related to a person s age or sex.

Measuring the protein biomarker in the blood will provide a simpler, more accurate way to predict clinical outcomes and may help to identify those at higher risk of developing dementia. The study is published today (29 September) in Science Translational Medicine.Around 50 million people each year worldwide experience TBI as a result of head injury. In the brains of these individuals, the nerve cells encounter severe stretching and sheering forces which cause damage to their axons, the part which transmits electrical signals. Axonal damage is the best predictor of clinical outcomes and recovery but has been difficult to measure in patients. The team from the UK Dementia Research Institute s (UK DRI) Care Research and Technology Centre, based at Imperial College London, set out to identify a chemical that could be easily detected in the blood - a biomarker - that would accurately reflect this axonal damage in the brain after TBI. To do this they harnessed cutting-edge technology called single molecule array (SiMoA) that can measure sub-femtomolar (10-16) levels of chemicals in the blood. In this multicentre study, the researchers began by detecting proteins that are important to the structure of the nerve cell axons. They found that measuring blood levels of neurofilament light, a protein important for axonal structure provided a remarkably accurate long-term prognosis for the patient. The team also used advanced types of brain imaging to validate blood test findings. Blood levels of neurofilament light were found to be closely related to measures from diffusion MRI, an advanced type of imaging which also provides measures related to damage to axons. The team also compared blood levels of neurofilament light with a special type of brain imaging that measures shrinkage (atrophy) of the brain, indicating the loss of nerve cells. They found that blood levels of neurofilament light tracked extremely well to brain atrophy and importantly predicted further nerve cell degeneration up to one year after the injury. These findings mean future blood tests could provide similar information to MRIs, but in a more cost-effective and accessible manner. Dr Neil Graham, joint first author and Alzheimer s Research UK Clinical Research Fellow at the UK DRI s Care Research and Technology Centre, based at Imperial College London, said:  I m extremely excited by the ultrasensitive blood test technology we used here as it has opened up a whole new world of possibilities when it comes to precise injury diagnosis and prediction of outcomes after head injury. This is particularly useful in the area of dementia risk assessment after TBI, which is very challenging at present. If we could roll the neurofilament light test out across the country, it would be hugely impactful. We re gearing up to offer it to NHS patients at Imperial in the near future. Dr Karl Zimmerman, joint first author and postdoctoral researcher at the UK DRI s Care Research and Technology Centre, based at Imperial College London, said:  These results are exciting as they pave the way for the use of these advanced biomarkers in the assessment of head injuries in other contexts. We have studied and shown that there may be similar changes occurring in professional athletes exposed to head injuries. We re setting up more research to look at this in detail to improve care of sportspeople concerned with later life risk of dementia. Professor David Sharp, senior author of the paper and Director of the UK DRI s Care Research and Technology Centre based at Imperial College London, said:  Outcomes after TBI are very difficult to predict. This is a major challenge for doctors trying to care for patients recovering from head injuries of all severities. What we need are more accurate diagnostic tests that can be used in our major trauma units and clinics. Our work shows that measuring neurofilament light soon after head injury helps predict who will develop long-term problems. We are applying this in various contexts, including for the investigation of sporting TBI, and will be investigating whether this blood test can be used to predict those at high risk of developing dementia. The study involved over 200 patients who had experienced moderate to severe TBI, recruited from eight major trauma centres across Europe. In 56% of cases the injuries were classed as  high energy , involving falls from over 3 metres or collisions at more than 30km/hour, with the majority of these caused by road traffic accidents. The biomarker identified in the study, neurofilament light, is a protein found in neurons, important for the overall structural stability of these cells. It has become a useful tool for diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis across neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer s, but it s potential for use in TBI had not been fully assessed and optimised until now.

But how do we know which of these children might be affected? Today, various studies have contributed to the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that are associated with the development of psychotic illnesses. The problem is that the ability to identify those at risk and adapt their treatment accordingly remains limited. Indeed, many variables - other than neurobiological - contribute to their development. This is why a team from the University of Geneva has joined forces with a team from the EPFL to use in a longitudinal manner an artificial intelligence tool:  the network analysis method. This algorithm correlates many variables from different backgrounds - neurobiological, psychological, cognitive, etc. - over a period of twenty years, in order to determine which current symptoms are predictive of a psychotic illness in the child s future developmental trajectory. These results, to be read in the journal eLife, will enable early treatment of children deemed to be at risk of developing psychological disorders, with the aim of preventing or even avoiding them.One in 4,000 people have a microdeletion of chromosome 22, which can lead to the development of psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, in adolescence. However, only one third of them will eventually be affected by a psychotic disorder. How can we determine which ones? ""For the time being, the analyses are looking at the neurobiological mechanisms involved in psychological disorders, as well as the presence of certain symptoms that are assimilated to a psychological illness, without knowing which are the most relevant"", explains Corrado Sandini, a researcher at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Geneva  Faculty of Medicine, to the Fondation P le Autisme and first author of the study.Not being able to take into account the degree of importance of each symptom can be problematic in predicting the course of the disease and providing the most appropriate treatment for the patient. ""This is why we thought of using the network analysis method"", he continues. This methodology, which is currently used on adults, makes it possible to combine variables from completely different worlds in the same analysis space, while considering them individually. ""Since the development of psychotic illnesses depends on many variables other than purely neurobiological ones, this algorithm would make it possible to highlight the most important symptoms to alert about the potential risks of a child becoming schizophrenic, for example"", says St phan Eliez, professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine and to the Fondation P le Autisme.

Aging is a risk factor for the accumulation of TDP-43 (transduction responsive region DNA-binding protein of 43kDa) in the motor cortex. TDP-43 is a protein that tends to accumulate in increasing amounts, and the amount is strictly controlled by the splicing of TDP-43. Through cell experiments and analysis of human brain tissue, researchers at Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, led by Akihiro Sugai, M.D., Ph.D., have found that methylation of TDP-43 DNA is involved in the background of motor cortex involvement with aging in ALS.""It's been a big mystery why TDP-43 selectively accumulates in the motor cortex as we get older in ALS. TDP-43 accumulates when its amount increases. However, TDP-43 itself is expressed in all cells, and the amount of TDP-43 in a cell is maintained at a strictly constant level through splicing,"" says Osamu Onodera, M.D., Ph.D., director at Brain Research Institute, Niigata University. ""Many neurological diseases, including ALS, have 'aging' as a risk factor. DNA methylation modifications, which shape tissue specificity, are also affected by aging, which in turn affects splicing. This is why we focused on methylation at the regulatory site of the TDP-43 gene.""The researchers selectively demethylated the DNA region involved in the TDP-43 regulatory mechanism in the cell experiment. As a result, they revealed that the demethylation of this DNA region increases the TDP-43 gene expression levels. Next, they analyzed the DNA methylation status in the TDP-43 regulatory region using human brain tissues, which showed the demethylation with aging and the increase in the TDP-43 gene expression levels in the motor cortex. Furthermore, based on the estimation of the 'biological age' from the degree of DNA demethylation, they found that in the motor cortex with ALS, the biological age associate with the younger age of onset.""Regulation of methylation in the regulatory region of TDP-43 may provide a new therapeutic approach for ALS. Tissue-specific, age-related accumulation of specific proteins is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease, but it is not clear why,  says James Hyman, study author and associate professor of psychology at UNLV.  We show that a central feature of diabetes, hyperglycemia, impairs neural activity in ways that are similar to what is observed in preclinical Alzheimer's disease models. This is the first evidence showing neural activity changes due to hyperglycemia overlap with what is observed in Alzheimer s systems. The research project is the continuation of a six-year collaboration between Hyman and coauthor Jefferson Kinney, chair and professor in UNLV s Department of Brain Health, to better understand why diabetes can elevate risk for Alzheimer s. The work is funded by a grant from the National Institute on Aging. As the number of Alzheimer s disease diagnoses rapidly rises and the incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes has accelerated, it s crucial that we understand what connects these two disorders,  Kinney said.The researchers found that two parts of the brain that are central to forming and retrieving memories   the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex   were over-connected, or hypersynchronized. When it came time to remember the correct information and complete a task, these two parts of the brain   which are affected early in Alzheimer s progression   were over-communicating with each other, sparking errors. We know synchrony is important for different parts of the brain to work together. But, we re finding more and more these days, that the key with neural synchrony is it has to happen at the right time, and it has to happen with control,  Hyman said.  Sometimes, there s just too much  talking  between certain areas and we think this leads to memory difficulties, among other things. Hyman compares the situation to a CEO who hands over a majority of the company s business operations to their son, who then decides to upend previous communication structures and become the sole gatekeeper of information. The only communication the CEO has is with one person, as opposed to talking with all of the other people in the office,  Hyman said.  It is possible that in Alzheimer s patients there s over-connection in certain areas where there should be flexibility. And in the models in our study, we re seeing evidence of that in real-time at these crucial moments to do the task. This most recent finding not only provides novel information about brain activity in the hyperglycemia model, it also provides an additional important measure that can be used for continuing research. Our next step is to combine the biochemical markers and electrophysiology data to test specific mechanisms responsible and potential treatments,  said Kinney.  This research will now be able to work towards understanding the risk as well as what may be able to be done to help. Hyman agreed. To see the science now start to come out, and to now hopefully have an impact on the field, and to have other labs potentially build on our work, I think really opens up lots of avenues for future exploration. Jeff Kinney s group has put years into developing this model, and we re fortunate enough to be collaborating with them and be a part of this growing area of research. It speaks to the power of collaborative work, which is one of the things that is fantastic about UNLV. Reference: Wirt RA, Crew LA, Ortiz AA, et al.

Where do conspiracy theories originate from? Prof. W odzis aw Duch from the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics of the Nicolaus Copernicus University (NCU) has decided to examine the process of their development in the brain. An article dealing with this issue has just been published in a prestigious journal ""Patterns"" (Cell Press).The multitude of conspiracy theories people believe in all over the world is astonishing. They actually accompany each significant event: a catastrophe, assassination, death of a famous person or, currently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Because the formation of a distorted image of reality is so widespread this topic has been dealt with by numerous scientists. Various studies, articles and books using psychological, sociological, political science, or anthropological approaches have been published. However, the presumed conspiracy theories mechanism is still a matter of speculations because the problem is scarcely researched by specialists in natural science. ""Memetics is thus the theory of human behavior and provides a common paradigm for cultural studies, religious studies, sociology and other fields of social studies which describe our mental space. The main challenge it faces is the identification of memes, studying how they are reproduced, spread, and developed,"" explains Prof. Duch. ""But, what is the meme from the physical, neuroscientific point of view? It has not been described so far.""""Because this is how their brains function. We think the way our brains allow us to do,"" says Prof. Duch.  ""On the one hand, we are dealing with genetic determinism: human cognitive capacity and affective reactions are much varied and dependent on the presence of genes responsible for building individual brain structure, for example COMT, DARPP-32, DRD2 - the genes connected with dopamine, an important neurotransmitter.  Hence, genes determine personality, predispositions, skills, but not particular decisions.On the other hand, genetic determinism only partially affects our neuronal determinism, namely, our brain  formation resulting from our life experience, upbringing, culture, and religion.""We cannot think differently than our neuronal activity allows,"" says Prof. Duch. ""The whole history of a given individual, his/her experience starting in the fetal stage, may influence easy activation of certain neurons in the brain whereas other neurons require strong stimulation in order to be activated. It would be interesting to find out how certain bits of information we receive are turned into memes and reproduced while others remain unnoticed.""The formation of biological and psychological mechanisms of false belief and thus conspiracy theories is obviously very complex. Accepting distorted images of reality can be a side effect of many different factors such as education or life experience, and this is why they are so difficult to study.  ""Moreover, accepting simple explanations can be satisfactory; it saves energy (and the brain consumes huge amounts of it), brings a pleasant sense of understanding. In contrast, complex explanations require much effort and time to be fully understood. A simple, but false, explanation is thus attractive: it is always better than no explanation at all,"" explains Prof. Duch. This article has been republished from the following materials.

He wanted to know why.Following his recovery at home, Singh, a professor in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine and Bond Life Sciences Center, teamed up with MU undergraduate student Austin Spratt, Saathvik Kannan, a freshman at Hickman High School, and Siddappa Byrareddy, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, to analyze protein sequences for more than 300,000 COVID-19 samples of two emerging variants around the world, known as Delta and Delta Plus.Using bioinformatics tools and programming, the team identified five specific mutations that are far more prevalent in Delta Plus infections compared to Delta infections, including one mutation, K417N, that is present in all Delta Plus infections but not present in nearly any Delta infections. The findings provide important clues to researchers about the structural changes to the virus recently and highlight the need to expand the toolbox in the fight against COVID-19. Whether it is natural antibodies produced from previously having COVID-19 or the antibodies produced from the vaccine, we are showing structurally how dangerous and clever the virus is by being able to mutate in a way that the antibodies don t seem to recognize and defend against these new variants,  Spratt said.  These findings help explain why there have been so many people testing positive for the Delta variants despite being vaccinated or having previously been infected with COVID-19. Singh explained that while COVID-19 vaccines have been effective, another possible tool in responding to the pandemic could be the development of antiviral drugs that target specific areas of the virus that remain unchanged by mutations. There has not yet been a vaccine for HIV due to the unpredictable variability that often comes with viruses that mutate frequently,  Singh said.  If we can develop small molecule drugs that target the part of the virus that does not mutate, that will be the ultimate solution for combatting the virus.

This model assesses the altered states of consciousness common in group rituals, which Dr Newson identified as the  4Ds  - dance, drums, sleep deprivation, and drugs. Through a retrospective online survey with those who have attended memorable raves or free parties, Dr Newson explored whether attendees engaged in the 4Ds and whether this in turn was associated with feelings of awe and personal transformation.It was found that engaging in the 4Ds at raves or free parties was associated with personal transformation for those who experienced the event as awe-inspiring, especially for people with open personalities. The more an individual felt that they were personally transformed by the experience, the more bonded to the group they felt, and the more they were willing to donate to a related charity.The findings suggest that of the 4Ds dancing and drugs, particularly psychedelics, were most strongly associated with building meaningful social bonds in a ritualised environment. Dr Newson suggests that this links firmly to the potential for therapeutic benefits of feeling part of a group that could play a key role in psychedelic therapies. She said: Psychedelics have a deep-rooted stigma related to recreational drug use and harm, but they are being used more and more in clinical studies for drug therapy in the search for more effective treatment pathways   for example, treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or even anorexia. We found positive associations between dancing and psychedelic drug use at these group rituals with feelings of awe and social bonding that could prove useful in supporting the growing wealth of clinical therapies.

This is the conclusion of an experimental study in which researchers compared various colonies of the common black ant with one another. ""We assume that increased diversity results in more efficient distribution of tasks by the workers, leading to an improvement in the overall performance of a colony,"" explained Dr. Romain Libbrecht of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), who led the study. It seems that colonies in which ants differ more from each other raise more larvae to maturity than colonies consisting of closely related individuals. The results of this study may explain why unusual phenomena, such as queens that are fertilized more than once and colonies with several queens simultaneously, could have evolved in some insect societies. This occurs not only in ants but also among many different species of eusocial insects.","Published: September 29, 2021"

Two new Stanford-led studies could help pave the way by laying out a blueprint for coordinating research on methane removal technologies, and modeling how the approach could have an outsized effect on reducing future peak temperatures.The analyses, published Sept. 27 in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, reveal that removing about three years-worth of human-caused emissions of the potent greenhouse gas would reduce global surface temperatures by approximately 0.21 degrees Celsius while reducing ozone levels enough to prevent roughly 50,000 premature deaths annually. The findings open the door to direct comparisons with carbon dioxide removal   an approach that has received significantly more research and investment   and could help shape national and international climate policy in the future. The time is ripe to invest in methane removal technologies,  said Rob Jackson, lead author on the new research agenda paper(link is external) and senior author on the modeling study(link is external). Jackson is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor of Energy and Environment in Stanford s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences. The relative concentration of methane has grown more than twice as fast as that of carbon dioxide since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Removing methane from the atmosphere could reduce temperatures even faster than carbon dioxide removal alone because methane is 81 times more potent in terms of warming the climate over the first 20 years after its release, and about 27 times more potent over a century. Methane removal also improves air quality by decreasing the concentration of tropospheric ozone, exposure to which causes an estimated one million premature deaths annually worldwide due to respiratory illnesses.Unlike carbon dioxide, the bulk of methane emissions are human-driven. Primary culprits include agricultural sources such as livestock, which emit methane in their breath and manure, and rice fields, which emit methane when flooded. Waste disposal and fossil fuel extraction also contribute substantial emissions. Natural sources of methane, including soil microbes in wetlands, account for the remaining 40 percent of global methane emissions. They further complicate the picture because some of them, such as thawing permafrost, are projected to increase as the planet warms.While development of methane removal technologies will not be easy, the potential financial rewards are big. If market prices for carbon offsets rise to $100 or more per ton this century, as predicted by most relevant assessment models, each ton of methane removed from the atmosphere could then be worth more than $2,700. The modeling study(link is external) uses a new model developed by the United Kingdom s national weather service (known as the UK Met Office) to examine methane removal s potential impacts while accounting for its shorter lifetime than carbon dioxide   a key factor because some of the methane removed would have disappeared anyway. The researchers created a set of scenarios by varying either the amount removed or the timing of removal to generalize their results over a wide range of realistic future emissions pathways.Under a high emissions scenario, the analysis showed that a 40 percent reduction in global methane emissions by 2050 would lead to a temperature reduction of approximately 0.4 degrees Celsius by 2050. Under a low emissions scenario where temperature peaks during the 21st century, methane removal of the same magnitude could reduce the peak temperature by up to 1 degree Celsius. This new model allows us to better understand how methane removal alters warming on the global scale and air quality on the human scale,  said modeling study lead author and research agenda coauthor Sam Abernethy, a PhD student in applied physics who works in Jackson s lab. The path to achieving these climate and air quality improvements remains unclear. To bring it into focus, the research agenda paper(link is external) compares and contrasts aspects of carbon dioxide and methane removal, describes a range of technologies for methane removal and outlines a framework for coordinating and accelerating its scale-up. The framework would help facilitate more accurate analysis of methane removal factors ranging from location-specific simulations to potential interactions with other climate change mitigation approaches.Methane is challenging to capture from air because its concentration is so low, but burgeoning technologies   such as a class of crystalline materials called zeolites capable of soaking up the gas   hold the promise of a solution, according to the researchers. They argue for increased research into these technologies  cost, efficiency, scaling and energy requirements, potential social barriers to deployment, co-benefits and possible negative by-products. Carbon dioxide removal has received billions of dollars of investments, with dozens of companies formed,  said Jackson.  We need similar commitments for methane removal.

The technique could pave the way for the development of a much-needed new treatment for people with cartilage damage.Cartilage acts as a shock absorber in joints, but it is susceptible to damage through daily wear-and-tear, or trauma from sports injuries and falls. The current gold-standard surgical approach to restore regions of damaged cartilage, using cartilage cells, is not wholly successful. This is because survival of the repair tissue, generated by cartilage cells at the site of damage, has been shown to decrease significantly after 5-10 years. As such, there is a need for a new way to promote robust, long-term repair through the implantation of cartilage tissue, as opposed to cartilage cells, at the site of damage.Scientists at the Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration think they may have found the answer. They generated cartilage tissue in the laboratory by successfully differentiating embryonic stem cells into cartilage cells, and then used these to generate three-dimensional pieces of cartilage tissue without any synthetic or natural supporting materials. This is known as a  scaffold-free  cartilage tissue engineering technique. The generated cartilage tissue is structurally and mechanically comparable to normal human cartilage with the potential to form a stable and longer lasting repair than current treatment options available to patients.The researchers are the first to use the scaffold-free technique to generate cartilage tissue, which is scaled up beyond 1 mm without adversely affecting its structural and mechanical properties.  The team hopes that eventually, after more research is conducted, this lab created tissue could be routinely used in surgery to mend damaged cartilage.The interdisciplinary study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, was led by Dr Franchesca Houghton and Dr Rahul Tare from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.Dr Houghton said:  This research is exciting as our ability to generate cartilage with properties akin to normal human cartilage has the potential to provide a robust tissue engineered product for cartilage repair. Dr Tare adds:  This tissue-based approach of replacing  like-for-like  has the potential to constitute a step-change improvement in current cell-based surgical approaches for repairing damaged cartilage and improve long-term patient outcomes.

They confirmed exclusive expression of CD99, CD146 and CD239 in 3D culture.Dr. Josip Blonder from The Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Researchsaid, ""Lung carcinoma is the deadliest cancer in the United States and worldwide.""In 2019, the American Cancer Society reported 142,670 deaths from lung cancer in the United States. Lung cancer affects men and women equally, with an overall five-year survival rate of 19%. Histologically, 80 85% of all cases belong to non-small-cell lung cancer. The most common form of NSCLC is the adenocarcinoma of the lung. Despite extensive research and economic investments, about 95% of new drugs against lung carcinoma eventually fail in clinical trials. Adherent two-dimensional in vitro cultures of human cancer cell lines are the mainstay preclinical testing model used in lung cancer drug development and discovery. In solid tumors, however, cancer cells grow in a three-dimensional environment. This makes the 2D cultured cells unable to truly reproduce the natural proliferation, migration, and/or drug permeation taking place in their innate 3D environment.To circumvent this shortcoming, the 3D cancer cell culture has been proposed as a more accurate/relevant preclinical testing model, not only biomechanically but also at the genome, proteome, and metabolome level. This approach also creates a pathway towards the development of a preclinical atlas depicting the molecular profiles of cell lines grown in 2D vs. 3D, information that is sorely needed to accurately monitor drug development. Contemporary MS-based proteomics represents a potent technology capable of revealing alterations in protein level expression/regulation and changes in post-translational modifications associated with preclinical drug evaluation.Furthermore, the differential molecular phenotype of a NSCLC cell line membrane proteome grown in 2D- vs. 3D-culture is still missing.The Blonder Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that the NCI-H23 cells harbors KRas4BG12C homozygous mutant and could be used as a preclinical NSCLC model for testing allele-specific covalent inhibitors that bind to the cysteine at position 12 of the G12C KRas4B mutant. Importantly, the present approach allows for direct proteoform- and allele-specific quantitation of changes in KRasWT and KRasG12C mutant regulation, and can be easily employed in quantifying responses to allele-specific covalent inhibitors or any other therapeutic compounds affecting Ras expression. The shotgun proteomics is also amenable to absolute antibody-free quantitation of Ras isoforms using synthetic heavy isoform-specific tryptic peptide standards for LC-MS-based parallel reaction monitoring, these authors previously described targeting xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 in a complex membrane protein mixture.Reference: Kaczmarczyk JA, Roberts RR, Luke BT, et al.

Inflammation associated with debris from dying tumor cells can trigger metastasis, the spread of cancer throughout the body. We discovered that we can reduce or clear the chemotherapy-generated inflammation by inhibiting or blocking the enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), and the EP4 prostaglandin receptor,  said co-senior author Hammock, who holds a joint appointment with the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology and Comprehensive Cancer Center.

But researchers studying blood samples from more than 12,000 individuals in Ethiopia now estimate these tests missed nearly 10% of malaria cases caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the most common cause of malaria cases and deaths.The research, published in Nature Microbiology, showed that two genetic mutations to the parasite allow it to escape detection. This is a serious problem for malaria control efforts and a reminder that pathogens are very capable of adapting to survive,  said senior author Jonathan B. Parr, MD, assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at the UNC School of Medicine.  Surveillance across the Horn of Africa and alternative malaria diagnostic approaches in affected regions are urgently needed. Co-corresponding authors are Sindew M. Feleke, MSc, at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Jane Cunningham, MD, at the WHO, and Dr. Parr.This research project was conducted in partnership with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and the World Health Organization. The research team enrolled 12,572 participants along Ethiopia s border with Eritrea, Sudan, and South Sudan, using RDTs, PCR diagnostics, an ultrasensitive immunoassay for antigen detection, and next-generation sequencing to find that P. falciparum lacking the genes histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) and histidine-rich protein 3 (pfhrp3) escape detection by the RDTs and appear to have spread rapidly.In collaboration with Brown University s Jeffrey A. Bailey, MD, PhD, and Ozkan Aydemir, PhD, the researchers applied a molecular sequencing approach to pinpoint the particular deletion patterns of these genetic mutations.  Our method allowed us to study the rich genomic information surrounding these genes in fine detail and at scale, facilitating the identification of evolutionary origins of these deletions,  Aydemir said. Our work indicates that prhrp3 deletions have arisen independently multiple times over the course of years,  said Parr, who is a member of the UNC Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases.  We also found signs that RDT-based testing and treatment are driving a recent rise in pfhrp2 deletion mutation prevalence, allowing parasites to escape detection. In the Nature Microbiology paper, the authors ask,  What other advantages might pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites have over those with intact genes? Our limited understanding of the biology of these deletions makes this question hard to answer.  But the authors posit several lines of inquiry in the paper, though one thing is certain.Parr said,  We found clear evidence that parasites have recently evolved to escape detection by malaria rapid diagnostic tests along Ethiopia s borders with Sudan and Eritrea. False-negative results were common in multiple sites and will lead to misdiagnosis and malaria deaths without intervention. The results of this joint research effort have prompted us to change our diagnostic testing policies from HRP2/3-detecting RDTs to non-HRP2/3 targeted RDTs in the most affected regions of Ethiopia,  Feleke said.Also, along with several other unpublished reports, this study prompted the WHO to issue a statement of concern.Cunningham, said,  The WHO recommends that all malaria endemic countries start and maintain surveillance for pfhrp2/3 deletions and respond appropriately when they are confirmed, in order to prevent unnecessary morbidity and deaths and to safeguard inroads that have been made towards malaria elimination, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

In developing this technology, we hope to set the foundation for even more rapid global development of vaccines, at lower doses, in a pain- and anxiety-free manner,  said lead study author and entrepreneur in 3D print technology Joseph M. DeSimone, professor of translational medicine and chemical engineering at Stanford University and professor emeritus at UNC-Chapel Hill.The ease and effectiveness of a vaccine patch sets the course for a new way to deliver vaccines that are painless, less invasive than a shot with a needle and can be self-administered.Study results show the vaccine patch generated a significant T-cell and antigen-specific antibody response that was 50 times greater than a subcutaneous injection delivered under the skinThat heightened immune response could lead to dose sparing, with a microneedle vaccine patch using a smaller dose to generate a similar immune response as a vaccine delivered with a needle and syringe.While microneedle patches have been studied for decades, the work by Carolina and Stanford overcomes some past challenges: through 3D printing, the microneedles can be easily customized to develop various vaccine patches for flu, measles, hepatitis or COVID-19 vaccines.Advantages of the vaccine patchThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder of the difference made with timely vaccination. But getting a vaccine typically requires a visit to a clinic or hospital.There a health care provider obtains a vaccine from a refrigerator or freezer, fills a syringe with the liquid vaccine formulation and injects it into the arm.Although this process seems simple, there are issues that can hinder mass vaccination   from cold storage of vaccines to needing trained professionals who can give the shots.Meanwhile, vaccine patches, which incorporate vaccine-coated microneedles that dissolve into the skin, could be shipped anywhere in the world without special handling and people can apply the patch themselves.Moreover, the ease of using a vaccine patch may lead to higher vaccination rates.How the patches are madeIt s generally a challenge to adapt microneedles to different vaccine types, said lead study author Shaomin Tian, a researcher in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in the UNC School of Medicine. These issues, coupled with manufacturing challenges, have arguably held back the field of microneedles for vaccine delivery,  she said.Most microneedle vaccines are fabricated with master templates to make molds. However, the molding of microneedles is not very versatile, and drawbacks include reduced needle sharpness during replication. Our approach allows us to directly 3D print the microneedles, which gives us lots of design latitude for making the best microneedles from a performance and cost point-of-view,  Tian said.The microneedle patches were 3D printed at Carolina using a CLIP prototype 3D printer that DeSimone invented and is produced by CARBON, a Silicon Valley company he co-founded.The team of microbiologists and chemical engineers are continuing to innovate by formulating RNA vaccines, like the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, into microneedle patches for future testing. One of the biggest lessons we ve learned during the pandemic is that innovation in science and technology can make or break a global response,  DeSimone said.

After that, we developed a tool to analyze the data to understand the disease pathways better. The tool, called VarSAn (Variant Set Annotator, pronounced  version ), uses SNPs that have been identified by sequencing studies as being disease-related, to predict which pathways may be perturbed by these SNPs. Previously, scientists have looked at SNPs that show the strongest statistical signals with respect to a disease. They then carried out experiments to check whether each individual SNP was important. We re trying to approach the problem from a computational point of view. Does the whole gamut of SNPs identified in a genetic study point us to specific pathways that may not be known in the literature?  Sinha said.  The underlying computation is similar to how Google uses an algorithm to identify the right web pages for searches. These types of algorithms are applicable in biology as well to understand genetic variation. Additionally, 90% of the disease-related mutations are in parts of the DNA that do not code for proteins and using this type of approach will be useful for future work. The VarSAn tool was validated by two distinct approaches.  We first did a literature search to see if those identified pathways were relevant to the diseases we were looking at,  said Xiaoman Xie, a graduate student in the Sinha lab.  However, this type of validation is subjective and so we also developed an objective approach. The second approach is based on testing the consistency of VarSAn s findings.  If we have two studies that identify two sets of SNPs associated with the same disease, the algorithm should ideally identify the same set of pathways for both of them i.e., it should be consistent. However, if the tool is given two sets of SNPs associated with two different diseases, it should report pathways specific to each disease but not the same set of pathways,  Xie said.The team is now trying to make VarSAn an online tool where researchers can paste the list of SNPs and the tool reports the pathways directly.  Currently, if a user wants to use this tool, they have to download the repository and run the code themselves, which can be inconvenient. We re working on making it easier,  Xie said.Reference: Xie X, Kendzior MC, Ge X, Mainzer LS, Sinha S. VarSAn: associating pathways with a set of genomic variants using network analysis.

The findings suggest that pediatricians and other primary care providers could use the device to catch  amblyopia at an early age when it s easier to treat,  said Michael F. Chiang, M.D., director of the National Eye Institute (NEI), which supported research and development of the device. NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.Amblyopia is impaired vision in one eye and it is the leading cause of preventable monocular (single eye) vision loss, affecting three of every 100 children in the U.S.During early childhood, our developing brains learn how to take images from each eye and fuse them into a single image to produce vision. Amblyopia develops when misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) or decreased acuity in one eye interferes with the brain s ability to process visual information from both eyes, causing it to favor one eye. Once a child is visually mature, vision lost in the weaker eye cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.Children with amblyopia can suffer from poor school performance and impairments in depth perception and fine motor skills such as handwriting and other hand-eye coordinated activities.Treatment of amblyopia generally involves placing a patch over the good eye to improve vision in the weaker eye. Patching is less successful as children get older, making early detection crucial. However, this depends on timely diagnosis by the child s doctor, and most pediatricians are equipped only for basic eye chart vision screening tests, which are not useful for detecting amblyopia in very young children.The screening device works by assessing the eyes  ability to fixate together. Held 14 inches from the eyes, the child fixates on a smiley face while the device simultaneously scans both retinas. The scan involves a polarized laser that probes nerve fibers in an area of the light-sensing retina called the fovea, which is important for central vision. Even a subtle misalignment of the foveas   called small-angle strabismus   can interfere with the brain s ability to integrate images from both eyes. The device calculates a binocularity score that indicates whether the child requires referral to an eye health physician for further investigation.For the study, 300 children, ages 2 to 6 years, with no known eye disorders were recruited during previously scheduled visits to two Kaiser Permanente Southern California pediatric clinics.Two non-ophthalmic research associates who were trained how to use the device screened each child, and the results were compared against those from an eye examination performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist who was unaware of the device s results.  The device detected all six cases (100% sensitivity) of amblyopia and/or strabismus that had been confirmed by the professional eye examination. The device also flagged an additional 45 children as possibly having amblyopia and/or strabismus who were later determined by the eye examination to be normal (85% specificity). In the hands of a trained user, it takes 28 seconds to sit the child down, perform the test, and record the results   provided that the child cooperates   which is an important consideration for its adoption in busy pediatric care settings,  said the study s co-lead investigator, Shaival S. Shah, M.D., a pediatric ophthalmologist at Kaiser Permanente based in Tustin Ranch, California. The test itself requires just 2.5 seconds of a child s attention.A key limitation of the study was that the device was not compared with currently available photo-screening devices. Such devices detect differences in light reflexes in each eye and produce images that can help detect risk factors for amblyopia, but not amblyopia itself, which can result in both over and under detection of amblyopia.By contrast, the pediatric vision scanner detects the presence of amblyopia as opposed to the risk factors of amblyopia, which may lead to fewer unnecessary referrals to pediatric ophthalmologists.The pediatric vision screener tested in the study is a prototype of blinq.  , a device that was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016.Reference: Shah SS, Jimenez JJ, Rozema EJ, Nguyen MT, Preciado M, Mehta AM.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/old-radiology-reports-used-by-ai-to-understand-medical-images-354152,Old Radiology Reports Used by AI To Understand Medical Images Scientists have used radiology reports that accompany medical images to improve the interpretive abilities of machine learning algorithms  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Getting a quick and accurate reading of an X-ray or some other medical images can be vital to a patient s health and might even save a life. Obtaining such an assessment depends on the availability of a skilled radiologist and, consequently, a rapid response is not always possible. For that reason, says Ruizhi  Ray  Liao, a postdoc and a recent PhD graduate at MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL),  we want to train machines that are capable of reproducing what radiologists do every day.  Liao is first author of a new paper, written with other researchers at MIT and Boston-area hospitals, that is being presented this fall at MICCAI 2021, an international conference on medical image computing.Although the idea of utilizing computers to interpret images is not new, the MIT-led group is drawing on an underused resource   the vast body of radiology reports that accompany medical images, written by radiologists in routine clinical practice   to improve the interpretive abilities of machine learning algorithms. The team is also utilizing a concept from information theory called mutual information   a statistical measure of the interdependence of two different variables   in order to boost the effectiveness of their approach.Here s how it works: First, a neural network is trained to determine the extent of a disease, such as pulmonary edema, by being presented with numerous X-ray images of patients  lungs, along with a doctor s rating of the severity of each case. That information is encapsulated within a collection of numbers. A separate neural network does the same for text, representing its information in a different collection of numbers. A third neural network then integrates the information between images and text in a coordinated way that maximizes the mutual information between the two datasets.  When the mutual information between images and text is high, that means that images are highly predictive of the text and the text is highly predictive of the images,  explains MIT Professor Polina Golland, a principal investigator at CSAIL.Liao, Golland, and their colleagues have introduced another innovation that confers several advantages: Rather than working from entire images and radiology reports, they break the reports down to individual sentences and the portions of those images that the sentences pertain to. Doing things this way, Golland says,  estimates the severity of the disease more accurately than if you view the whole image and whole report. And because the model is examining smaller pieces of data, it can learn more readily and has more samples to train on. While Liao finds the computer science aspects of this project fascinating, a primary motivation for him is  to develop technology that is clinically meaningful and applicable to the real world. To that end, a pilot program is currently underway at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to see how MIT s machine learning model could influence the way doctors managing heart failure patients make decisions, especially in an emergency room setting where speed is of the essence.The model could have very broad applicability, according to Golland.  It could be used for any kind of imagery and associated text   inside or outside the medical realm. This general approach, moreover, could be applied beyond images and text, which is exciting to think about. Reference: Liao R, Moyer D, Cha M, et al.

This is the first study to analyse the time trend of autism diagnosis in a population-based UK clinical cohort by developmental stage, level of severity and by gender, over a twenty-year period.Differing rates of increase between subgroups suggest effects are primarily due to increased recognition, although an actual increase in autism incidence cannot be ruled out.A UK policy introduced in 2009 to invest in adult assessment centre may underpin the rise in adult  diagnosis. As there is not really a plausible reason why autism should increase more in adults and females our study suggests the change is probably due to increased identification, and not more people with neurodevelopmental disorders per se.  said lead author Ginny Russell, from the University of Exeter.""However, autism is not like a continent awaiting discovery. The definition of what constitutes autism has changed over time, and females and adults were not often thought of as having autism 20 years ago. The vocal work of charities and media coverage, combined with changes in policy has led to more assessment centres for adults, and an autism narrative that many women and girls identify with.  Consequently demand for diagnosis has never been higher. Data was taken from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care database, which contains patients registered with practices contributing data to the CPRD between 1998 and 2018. A total of 65,665 patients had a diagnosis of autism recorded in 2018.The findings also highlighted increased age of diagnosis over time within each developmental stage. In preschools this could be partly because diagnosis of autism in younger children is obviously complex and may need to go at the family s pace. De-stigmatization of the label due to work by the neurodiversity movement and parent-led lobby groups may have contributed to rising demand for diagnosis in order to access support, outstripping the capacity to carry out assessments in clinical practice.Autism is popularly conceptualized as a  male  disorder. In response there has been a drive toward referral of more females. The study, which shows a marked growth in female diagnoses compared with males, suggest such initiatives have been having an effect.Reference: Russell G, Stapley S, Newlove-Delgado T, et al.

This is a drug that s used for epilepsy,  says Keith Vossel, MD, MSc, director of the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer s Disease Research at UCLA, and the principal investigator on the clinical trial.  We used it in this study for Alzheimer s patients who had evidence of silent epileptic activity, which is seizure-like brain activity without the associated physical convulsions.  Alzheimer s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Early symptoms include short-term memory loss, decline in problem solving, word-finding difficulties, and trouble with spatial navigation. Among Alzheimer s patients, an estimated 10-22% develop seizures, while an additional 22-54% exhibit silent epileptic activity.  Dr. Vossel showed in earlier studies that patients who experience silent epileptic activity in their brains have a more rapid decline in cognitive function. The researchers chose to test the anti-seizure medication levetiracetam, which was approved by the FDA in 1999 and had also performed well in animal models of Alzheimer s disease. Now available as a generic, levetiracetam costs around $70 per year. The dose tested in the trial was 125 mg twice a day, far less than a typical dose used for epilepsy. In the study, 54 patients with mild Alzheimer s symptoms were screened for silent epileptic activity using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to monitor them overnight, as well as an hour-long magnetoencephalogram (MEG) to record magnetic waves generated from electrical activity.   MEG can pick up epileptic activity that EEGs miss because it s looking at a different population of brain cells,  Dr. Vossel explained.  Among the patients screened for the study, 34 patients were eligible to participate, with nearly 40% having epileptic activity, and the remainder having no epileptic activity (patients on anti-seizure medications due to preexisting seizure disorders were excluded prior to screening).  These patients were then divided into two groups with one group receiving placebo for four weeks, followed by a 4-week period of receiving no drug and then a 125 mg dose of levetiracetam twice a day for four weeks. The second group received these same treatments in reverse order. This crossover design allowed the intervention to be tested on all participants with neither the patients nor the researchers knowing whether the patient was taking the actual drug on any given week.   During the study period, the researchers tested skills like the patients  abilities to problem solve, reason, remember words and how well they could navigate. For example, using a driving simulator on a computer monitor, they had participants learn to navigate a street route through a virtual city. The researchers found that the patients treated with levetiracetam showed trends toward improvement in cognitive function, but when the patients were separated into those with silent epileptic activity and those without, the patients with silent epileptic activity showed clear benefit from being on the drug. There were very clear differences between the groups,  Dr. Vossel says.  There s a subtype of Alzheimer s disease, consider it an epileptic variant, that s quite common, occurring in approximately 60% of patients. Patients with this form of Alzheimer's disease show symptomatic improvement with levetiracetam.  When doctors diagnose Alzheimer s disease, they do not typically test for silent seizures, so findings from the study may prompt them to consider whether a patient is potentially experiencing epileptic activity. There are some clinical features that indicate Alzheimer s patients are more likely to be having silent epileptic activity,  he says.  The main one is being under the age of 65 when symptoms begin.  In fact, he says, the drug also appeared to benefit younger patients even if they didn t have detectable epileptic activity. Patients in the study were already taking currently approved medications for Alzheimer s, and this study demonstrates that levetiracetam improves cognitive function better than current treatments alone. Future studies will be needed to find out whether taking the drug long-term can slow disease progression.   This study was intended to look for cognitive improvement during a short course of treatment,  Dr. Vossel says.  There are other studies that are ongoing to see if the drug can help slow the disease course over longer periods,  adding that future studies at UCLA will focus on recruiting a more diverse study population and testing other anti-seizure medications.

The same is believed true during withdrawal; finding a common brain pathway has proved elusive. In a new paper, publishing September 27, 2021 in the journal eNeuro, a multi-institution team of researchers describe how withdrawal from nicotine, methamphetamine and cocaine altered the functional architecture and patterns in the brains of mice, compared to control animals. They found that each drug produced a unique pattern of activity in the brain, but that mouse brains in withdrawal shared similar features. Perhaps more notably, the researchers said all psychostimulants shared a common link: Reduced modularity.  All brains are organized into semiautonomous groups of neurons with specific functions, such as the cortex, amygdala and thalamus. Each region, however, is connected and interacts with other regions performing similar functions, creating a functional unit called a module,  said senior author Olivier George, PhD, professor in Department of Psychiatry at University of California San Diego School of Medicine.  Think of it as many different work stations, one station is in control of your mood, another takes care of your needs, and many other stations takes care of your goals, memories, motivations, sensation, et cetera. The brain needs many modules to take care of all of these processes at the same time. We found that in withdrawal, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of modules compared to control mice. It s like the whole brain was dedicated to the effect of the lack of drugs, all of the work stations doing the same thing. That decreased modularity, the authors said, resulted in a complete restructuring of the brain networks. Reduced modularity has been shown in several brain disorders in humans, including traumatic brain injury and dementia. It may also be the common link between drugs of abuse.To conduct their studies, the scientists implanted osmotic mini-pumps in mice that contained either nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine or saline. The pumps remained in place for one week, with sufficient dosing and time to create a state of dependence. After the pumps were removed, the brains of mice were examined using single-cell whole-brain imaging at the peak of withdrawal symptoms, about eight to 12 hours post-pump removal.  We found that cocaine, methamphetamine and nicotine withdrawal all produced a major shuffling of brain regions with major increases in functional connectivity throughout the brain compared to control (saline) mice,  said George,  with a decrease in modular structuring of the brain most strongly with methamphetamine and cocaine, then nicotine.  The brains of methamphetamine and cocaine dependent mice were also very similar, consistent with their shared pharmacology, targeting the dopaminergic system.This reduced modularity was associated with a shift of networks being controlled by the higher-level cortex to sub-cortical networks. The effect, said researchers, has been documented in humans after abstaining from alcohol dependence and in persons suffering from dementia and traumatic brain injury. Reduced modularity is associated with cognitive deficits and inflexible behavior which may explain the obsession and compulsion for the drug in people with substance use disorder.George said the commonality of this kind of restructuring during withdrawal from psychostimulants helps explain why these drugs are so addictive. His team is currently using this approach to test experimental medications that may reverse and normalize brain network modularity.Reference: Kimbrough A, Kallupi M, Smith LC, Simpson S, Collazo A, George O.

The researchers examined the structural integrity of the heart cells and tested whether the tissue retained normal functions, such as autonomous beating and responsiveness to drugs and external electrical stimuli.The results, described in a paper published Sept. 22 in the journal Communications Biology, are a key proof-of-concept of supercooled tissue cryopreservation.The method they used, called isochoric supercooling, was pioneered in the lab of Boris Rubinsky, UC Berkeley Professor of the Graduate School at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, professor emeritus of bioengineering and a senior author of the study. To our knowledge, this is the first-ever report of the supercooling and revival of an autonomously beating, engineered human cardiac muscle,  said study co-lead author Matt Powell-Palm, a postdoctoral scholar in Rubinsky s lab.Rubinsky noted that these results have near-term implications for the preservation and transport of organ-on-a-chip platforms, expanding access beyond the select few labs that can manufacture them for research and industry.  Such platforms are valuable tools for the design of new drugs for diseases of the heart and other organs,  he said.The results also suggest that isochoric supercooling may be a viable technique in the future for preserving donor tissue and organs, a daunting challenge facing the transplantation community and the medical research field, the study authors said. The researchers cited estimates that seven out of 10 thoracic donor organs are discarded each year because of the inability to preserve them long enough to reach patients in need. The viability of a donor heart, for instance, is measured in hours, greatly limiting the number of potential recipients who could benefit from a lifesaving transplant. Currently, patients in Florida cannot receive a heart or lung from California because the organ would not survive the cross-country trip,  said Powell-Palm.Addressing those challenges is a key goal of the Advanced Technologies for the Preservation of Biological Systems (ATP-Bio) Engineering Research Center, funded last year by the National Science Foundation.

The findings published in Molecular Cell uncover the inner workings of cell receptors that are involved in cancer progression and inflammatory diseases. The complement system is an integral part of our body s defense mechanism against pathogenic attacks including viruses. When bacteria or viruses enter our body, the complement system is activated including two different membrane receptors called C5aR1 and C5aR2,  says Arun Shukla, the Joy Gill Chair Professor at IIT Kanpur who spearheaded the study.  While activation of the complement system is essential to combat harmful pathogens, excessive and sustained activation leads to inflammation, even life-threatening conditions like the ones responsible for severe complications in COVID-19. Using cutting-edge technologies such as CRISPR and cryogenic electron microscopy, the researchers unraveled the inner workings of C5aR2, providing an additional opportunity for therapeutic targeting for COVID-19.  To treat COVID-19, some scientists are already trying to block the activation of the C5aR1 receptor and clinical trials are already underway for Avdoralimab in patients with COVID-19 induced sever pneumonia. Our study opens up the possibility of targeting C5aR2 by designing new drug molecules that can bind to this receptor and block its activation and inflammation response,  says St phane Laporte, a Professor in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.Cells in the human body are surrounded by receptors that are important drug targets where medicines produce their beneficial effects. These receptors work as messengers because they receive and transmit signals that allow the cells to trigger physiological processes in our body, the researchers explain. We are very excited to decipher the finer details of these receptors using cutting-edge technologies. Such information should enhance our fundamental knowledge about cellular signaling and allow us to translate our findings into novel drug discovery,  concludes Arun Shukla.Reference: Pandey S, Kumari P, Baidya M, et al.

Faced with global vaccine inequality and the rapid spread of variants of concern, the need for easily-accessible antiviral therapeutics to treat people with COVID-19 is as pressing as ever, especially in low- and middle-income countries,  said Annette von Delft, Translational Scientist at the University of Oxford and NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. Most of the research and funding efforts early in the pandemic focused predominantly on repurposing of existing small molecule drugs and the more rapid development of novel monoclonal antibodies. Now, with the realization that COVID-19 will be a global issue for the foreseeable future we urgently need to develop novel antiviral therapeutics. We are therefore thrilled to receive this critical funding from Wellcome and hope it can lead to more support,  said Alpha Lee, Chief Scientific Officer at PostEra and Faculty Member at the University of Cambridge.The Moonshot started as a spontaneous virtual collaboration in March 2020. As countries locked down, a group of scientists, academics, pharmaceutical research teams and students began a worldwide, twitter-fuelled race against the clock to identify new molecules that could block SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop pills that would be readily available to the most vulnerable communities. Ultimately more than 150 scientists including dozens of students who put their own projects on hold  joined Moonshot to crowdsource ideas for molecular compounds, model them and evaluate them in-vitro against the virus. Their goal: a safe, globally affordable, not-for-profit oral treatment for COVID-19 and related viral pandemics.  Open drug discovery efforts are invariably super slow   ours has been an express train on tracks we have had to lay down as we go,  wrote Frank von Delft, Professor of Structural Chemical Biology at the University of Oxford and Principal Beamline Scientist at Diamond Light Source, in a Comment published in June in Nature.  It is a way of working none of us realized was possible. Collaborators of the Moonshot project include academic and industrial groups such as Diamond Light Source, the UK s national synchrotron; the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel); the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford (UK); PostEra (US/UK); the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (US); various drug discovery consultants including MedChemica Ltd (UK), Thames Pharma Partners (US), and Compass Business Partners (UK); and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (Switzerland), which is now taking the lead in coordinating the Wellcome-funded drive towards the clinic.Thanks to this unprecedented collaboration, rapid progress was made and the team now aims to identify pre-clinical candidate molecules by end of 2021   compounds that will be simple to manufacture in the form of pills and which will exert an anti-viral effect via potent inhibition of the main protease (MPro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The project now enters the more capital-intensive phase: tweaking, optimizing and testing these molecules to develop them into a safe treatment. The financial support from Wellcome will be key in this process. From its inception, this project has focused on the needs of low- and middle-income countries and the most vulnerable communities, by striving to identify drugs that remove the need of cold chain or injection, and by ensuring that the results are equitably accessible,  said Ben Perry, Discovery Open Innovation Leader at DNDi.  The project is based firmly in an open science environment and prioritized simplicity of synthesis of the future drugs, in order to facilitate manufacturing by any interested producer. If drug discovery efforts that were launched during the 2003 SARS epidemic had persevered and had been funded to completion, relevant anti-coronavirus drugs would have been more readily available when COVID-19 hit,  said Nir London, Senior Scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Now is the time to plan for the future. In addition to addressing this current pandemic, which is not showing signs of slowing, we want to develop one or more novel pan-coronavirus antiviral molecule for future outbreaks. We also want to provide an open platform to accelerate the response time when new pandemics arise. All the generated discovery scientific data and the general learnings of the project will be put in the public domain. Moonshot data is already available online to enable others to freely build on its work   the project has already generated over 50% of known structural information on the main protease, a key protein in SARS-CoV-2. The first clinical trials are expected in 2022.This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

Normal FLT3 genes produce an enzyme that signals bone marrow stem cells to grow and replenish. When mutated, FLT3 causes rapid growth of leukemia cells, leading to higher rates of relapse following treatment and lower survival overall.FLT3-mutated AML is particularly sensitive to a class of drugs called e-family tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), making them prime candidates for drug development, says first author David Young, M.D., Ph.D., who conducted the study while at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. Dr. Young is now at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.However, these TKIs and others often fail and patients relapse. In a series of experiments with human leukemia cell lines and mice, the Kimmel Cancer Center team demonstrated that the human alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) binds the drug, effectively preventing it from reaching its intended FLT3 mutation target and killing the cancer cells.Donald Small, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Division of Pediatric Oncology and the Kyle Haydock Professor of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, and colleagues treated mutant FLT3 cell lines grown in human plasma from healthy donors or standard laboratory conditions with lestaurtinib, TTT-3002 or midostaurin a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that targets FLT3   at various concentrations. Plasma is the clear part of blood that contains proteins and other non-cellular factors. They found that adding human plasma reduced the ability of TKI to inhibit FLT3, unlike blood components from other sources. Further testing identified human AGP as binding the three drugs and inhibiting their ability to kill leukemia cells.To demonstrate clinical relevance of the findings, the researchers collected blood samples from adults newly diagnosed with AML and looked at the effect of their plasma on midostaurin. In the presence of high inflammation, like in newly diagnosed patients with leukemia, AGP levels are elevated. As expected, the drug lost potency in the human plasma assay from these cases. Midostaurin is very specific and potent, and we ve seen about a 10% improvement in patient outcomes since the FDA approved its use in adults with AML in 2017,  says Young,  but we never got the  home run  we were looking for because it s bound by AGP. In another set of experiments, the team showed that this plasma protein inhibition could be reversed by adding an agent that also binds to AGP. Mifepristone is known to bind to AGP with an affinity comparable to or greater than that of the three drugs in the study. Researchers ran the FLT3 assay with human protein plasma, midostaurin and mifepristone. They found that mifepristone displaced the AGP-bound midostaurin, restoring its anti-FLT3 activity. Testing the concept in mice, they had similar results. We wanted to free up enough midostaurin to allow the drug to do its thing,  Young explains.  If we give human AGP, and give midostaurin plus mifepristone, it kills the leukemic cells. Mifepristone acts like a decoy that prevents midostaurin from binding to the glycoprotein. Although more testing and validation is needed, the researchers say mifepristone or other agents with similar AGP-binding properties could be tested in future clinical trials of combination TKI therapies, or developed as protein plasma  decoys  to increase the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapies. Screening of the Johns Hopkins Drug Library   a collection of nearly 3,000 FDA-approved drugs and compounds, maintained by study co-author Jun Liu, Ph.D., co-director of the cancer chemical and structural biology program at the at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center   has offered tantalizing promises of more drugs that may function like mifepristone to restore anti-FLT3 activity and might synergize with TKI therapies in other ways. There may be ways to affect the pharmacology of the human body to give these old drugs new life,  Young says.Reference: Young DJ, Nguyen B, Li L, et al.

The grant is a joint partnership with Dr. Patricia Dahia, a leading expert in neuroendocrine tumors at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.The five-year grant will support Soragni s efforts into creating miniature tumor organoids models of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, two rare catecholamine-secreting, neural crest-derived tumors originating from adrenal or extra adrenal paraganglia. These cancers can be benign or malignant, and it is often impossible to determine who is at risk for progression and metastasis. Even if the cancer doesn t metastasize, it can have serious symptoms due to the excessive secretion of hormones. Treatment options for these types of tumors are limited and, despite their genetic diversity, there are few personalized approaches. Advances in this area are dampened by a scarcity of research models to help uncover biological mechanisms that facilitate clinical outcome prediction and reveal molecular vulnerabilities which can be explored for therapeutic purposes.In collaboration with Dahia, Soragni and her team will create organoid models to replicate the full-functioning, catecholamine-secreting structures of tumors so they can better study their behavior, investigate tumor markers, and drug screen to identify potential new therapies. Being able to create models of these rare tumors in the lab can not only help us better understand the molecular and functional diversity of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, but also contribute to identifying pathways that can be targeted for therapy,  said Soragni, who is also an assistant professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA.

Previous science in the field has proven the virus, which causes cancers in the throat, mouth, and genital areas, can be found in the bloodstream but tests have had limited sensitivity.The new study provides ""ultrasensitive"" detection, which could pave the way toward greater use of precision medicine for patients with cancers affecting these vulnerable areas of the body.In a cohort of patients with advanced cervix cancer, the new sequencing method detected 20-fold lower levels of HPV circulating tumour DNA, making it a promising new method to monitor the disease.The results come from the laboratory of Princess Margaret Senior Scientist Dr. Scott Bratman and are published in Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, on Sept. 27.

A team from Empa and the Cantonal Hospital of St. Gallen is now in the process of developing a blood test that will enable a reliable diagnosis using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The researchers have recently published their first results of a successful pilot study in the journal Science Advances.A deep look into the molecular universeIn the beginning, physicist Peter Nirmalraj wanted to understand the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's in order to enable new approaches in diagnostics and therapy. One step further would be to decipher the exact role of beta-amyloid peptides and tau proteins associated with the neurodegenerative disease. Nirmalraj therefore set out not only to detect the mere presence of the suspicious proteins, but also to determine their variable shape and form as well as their amounts.Current methods allow the determination of the total amount of both proteins in body fluids. However, these techniques do not allow the visualization of differences in the shape and condition of protein accumulations. The researcher is therefore working on technologies that allow nanometer-scale observations in blood and yet do not destroy the structure and morphology of the proteins.Together with neurologists at the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen, Nirmalraj has now successfully completed an initial study. For their pilot study, he examined blood samples from 50 patients and 16 healthy subjects. Using AFM technology, the Empa researcher analyzed the surface of around 1000 red blood cells per person without knowing anything about their state of health. ""This was the only way to make sure the interpretation of the data remained objective,"" says Nirmalraj.Protein fibers as an indicatorThe Empa researcher measured the size, structure and texture of protein accumulations found on the blood cells. After thousands of red blood cells, the team eagerly awaited the comparison of the results from Nirmalraj's counts with the clinical data from the neurologists. And indeed, the researchers were able to discern a pattern that matched the patients' disease stage: People who had Alzheimer's disease had large amounts of protein fibers made up of beta-amyloid peptides and tau proteins. The proteins were able to assemble into fibers several hundred nanometers long. In healthy individuals or those with incipient brain disorders, however, Nirmalraj counted only few fibers.This proves the feasibility of blood analysis using AFM technology, the Empa researcher says: ""If a reliable blood test can be developed based on this method, people with suspected Alzheimer's would be spared the unpleasant puncture of the spinal canal in order to be able to diagnose the disease reliably.""However, there is still a long way to go before a simple blood test is available in hospitals. The team's next step is to corroborate the data by studying a larger number of subjects at different stages of the disease using AFM and chemical analysis.Reference: Nirmalraj PN, Schneider T, Felbecker A.

High cost, stringent transportation and storage conditions, and the global supply shortages of enzymes limit large-scaled testing. This means that most countries have to prioritize testing on vulnerable cases, which delays diagnostics and identification of positive cases, which again can hamper pandemic mitigation and suppression.Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is still the gold standard for whole-genome detection and has played a crucial role in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the sample-to-result takes several hours. The method necessitates a complex thermocycler instrument to raise and lower the reaction temperature in discrete steps.Simpler and less expensiveNon-enzymatic isothermal amplification methods, being more straightforward and faster, have shown promising potentials to substitute the qRT-PCR. Although these methods perform very well when the target gene is short, they have yet to function efficiently to detect whole genomes (long DNA or RNA targets).During the COVID-19 pandemic, the euro area alone experienced a 3.8% drop in GDP within the first quarter of 2020 (Eurostat 2020). Thus, developing a lower-cost methodology for pathogen detection would be highly beneficial for both patients and the healthcare systems aiming to battle future pandemics.Associate Professor Yi Sun and Postdoc Mohsen Mohammadniaei at DTU Health Tech have invented a one-pot assay, which they have named NISDA (Non-enzymatic isothermal strand displacement and amplification assay). The assay is for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA without the need for the RNA reverse transcription step of the qRT-PCR methodology. It enables a single-step detection routine. The user only needs to add the sample into a single tube, place it in the instrument and wait for 30 minutes to obtain the result.The assay works at a constant temperature requires no enzymes, and is based on the toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD) approach. TMSD is an enzyme-free molecular tool from which one strand of DNA or RNA (output) is displaced by another strand (input) to form a more stable duplex structure.High accuracy and sensitivityThe NISDA assay detected a very low concentration of RNA (10 copies/ L) in only 30 minutes. In collaboration with Hvidovre Hospital and Bispebjerg Hospital, the research team could clinically validate the NISDA assay, representing 100% specificity and 96.77% and 100% sensitivity when setting up in the laboratory and hospital, respectively.Associate Professor Yi Sun elaborates,  We exploited the TMSD approach and designed three DNA probes. One probe exchanged the whole genome to a short DNA strand. The other two probes utilized the exchanged short DNA to trigger a fluorescence signal amplification cascade reaction. The beauty of the NISDA assay is its simplicity. We removed the usage of enzymes to reduce the assay cost and enhance its robustness at room temperature. The extracted RNA from throat swab samples is added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 42  C for 30 minutes in the assay workflow. The next step is fluorescence measurement, and samples with significantly higher fluorescence signals than the control samples (negative) are considered positive.Towards a multiple disease diagnostics tool Being directly involved in improving people s health is the ultimate dream of a biomedical researcher. We believe that the NISDA assay has given us this wonderful chance to attain that ambition,  Postdoctoral Researcher Mohsen Mohammadniaei says. The next step is to further design the NISDA assay for detecting different pathogens and develop a point-of-care diagnostic device for multiple disease diagnostics. Another advantage of the NISDA assay is its ability to be designed for short RNA targets such as cancer biomarker microRNA. We are currently exploring different schemes for the commercialization of the NISDA assay. We are certain that the NISDA assay will become widely known soon , Associate Professor Yi Sun finishes.Reference: Mohammadniaei M, Zhang M, Ashley J, et al.

But are a child s long-term language skills shaped by how their brain develops during infancy, and how much of their language development is influenced by their environment and upbringing? Following dozens of children over the course of five years, a Boston University researcher has taken the closest look yet at the link between how babies  brains are structured in infancy and their ability to learn a language at a young age, and to what degree their environment plays a role in brain and language development. The new research, described in a paper published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, finds that the brain s organizational pathways might set a foundation for a child s language learning abilities within the first year of life. These pathways are known as white matter, and they act as the connectors between the billions of neurons called gray matter that comprise the brain tissue. This allows for the exchange of signals and for all of the different tasks and functions we need to perform, as well as all of the biological processes that sustain us.  A helpful metaphor often used is: white matter pathways are the  highways,  and gray matter areas are the  destinations ,  says BU neuroscientist and licensed speech pathologist Jennifer Zuk, who led the study. Zuk, a College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences: Sargent College assistant professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences, says the more someone does a certain task, like learning a new language, the stronger and more refined the pathways become in the areas of the brain responsible for that task, allowing information to flow more efficiently through the white matter highways. Recent evidence suggests that white matter most rapidly develops within the first two years of life, according to Zuk.In addition to white matter development, scientists have long known that the environment also plays an important role in shaping a person s language abilities, Zuk says. But many uncertainties remain about whether nature or nurture is more dominant in determining the makeup of white matter and how well a baby learns to communicate. In their study, Zuk says, she and her colleagues sought answers to several specific questions: from very early on, to what extent does predisposed brain structure play a role in development? Does the brain develop in tandem with language, and is the environment ultimately driving the progress of both? And to what extent does brain structure in early infancy set children up for success with language?To investigate this, Zuk and Boston Children s Hospital researcher and study senior author Nadine Gaab met with 40 families with babies to take images of the infants  brains using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gather first-of-its-kind data on white matter development. No small feat, considering the babies needed to be sound asleep to allow for crisp capture of their brain activity and structure using MRI. It was such a fun process, and also one that calls for a lot of patience and perseverance,  says Zuk, who had to master the challenge of getting 4-to-18-month-old babies comfortable enough to snooze through the MRI process the loud sounds of an MRI could be very disruptive to a sleeping baby.  There are very few researchers in the world using this approach,  she says,  because the MRI itself involves a rather noisy background and having infants in a naturally deep sleep is very helpful in accomplishing this pretty crazy feat. It s also the first time that scientists have used MRI to look at the relationship between brain structure and language development in full-term, typically developing children from infancy to school age. One important white matter pathway the researchers looked at using MRI is called the arcuate fasciculus, which connects two regions of the brain responsible for language production and comprehension. Using MRI, the researchers measured the organization of white matter by looking at how easily water diffuses through the tissue, indicating the pathway s density.Five years after first rocking babies to sleep and gently tucking them inside an MRI machine, Zuk and her collaborators met up with the children and their families again to assess each child s emerging language abilities. Their assessments tested each one s vocabulary knowledge, their ability to identify sounds within individual words, and their ability to blend individual sounds together to understand the word it makes.   According to their findings, children born with higher indications of white matter organization had better language skills five years later, suggesting that communication skills could be strongly linked to predisposed brain structure. But, Zuk says, this is only the first piece of a very complicated puzzle. Perhaps the individual differences in white matter we observed in infancy might be shaped by some combination of a child s genetics and their environment,  she says.  But it is intriguing to think about what specific factors might set children up with more effective white matter organization early on.  Although their findings indicate a foundation for language is established in infancy,  ongoing experience and exposure [to language] then builds upon this foundation to support a child s ultimate outcomes,  Zuk says.She says this means that during the first year of a child s life  there s a real opportunity for more environmental exposure [to language] and to set children up for success in the long term.  Zuk and her research partners plan to continue investigating the relationship between environmental and genetic components of language learning. Their goal is to help parents and caretakers identify early risk factors in language development in young children and determine strategies for strengthening babies  communicative skills early on in life.

They then played a game where they navigated a cursor through on-screen barriers. This time they did not earn anything for playing the game beyond their own satisfaction in doing well   an example of an intrinsic reward.The participants answered the same question about how they felt repeatedly throughout the study. Most people felt happier after earning more points or successfully navigating through the barriers but the contribution of either reward to happiness varied from person to person.The research team developed a mathematical equation to determine how much intrinsic and extrinsic rewards contributed to the participants  mood in a particular moment.They found that people whose happiness was more swayed by intrinsic rewards had more activity in their ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a reward area, during intrinsic rewards compared to extrinsic rewards, and vice versa. These results provide a potential avenue to assess preferences without asking people outright.Dr Bastien Blain, a Research Associate within the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology who co-authored the study, said: ""Using mathematical equations, we can measure the value of any repeatable experience based on its impact on happiness. We use our mathematical equation to measure the intrinsic reward of skilfully navigating a simple maze and the extrinsic reward of earning money in a different task. Our mathematical equation lets us predict which individuals will have both more happiness and more brain activity for intrinsic compared to extrinsic rewards. The same approach can be used in principle to measure what people actually prefer without asking them explicitly, but simply by measuring their mood.""Professor Robb Rutledge, Assistant Professor at Yale University who co-authored the study, said:  Over a century ago, Francis Edgeworth described an idealised instrument, which he called a hedonometer, for continually registering the height of pleasure experienced by an individual. Edgeworth's idea is not actually as useful as it could be because you never know what it was that caused changes in happiness. Our 'computational hedonometer' can be used to tell how much people emotionally value experiences. Reference: Chew B, Blain B, Dolan RJ, Rutledge RB. A neurocomputational model for intrinsic reward.

(In the UK, this is approx. 1,250-2,500 people.)As a result of the study, the new causal variants, known as truncating ALPK3 (alpha-protein kinase) variants, should be added to genetic testing/screening, allowing doctors to identify a greater number of people who are at risk of developing the condition and who would therefore benefit from regular monitoring.In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart muscles are thicker, which can make it harder for the heart to receive and pump blood. While in most cases the condition will not affect daily life, it can cause heart failure and is frequently cited as the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in young people.About half of cases already have known genetic causes, linked to eight to 10 specific genes (only two of these single genes were found in the last decade).Lead author Dr Luis Lopes (UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science), also a Consultant Cardiologist at Barts Health NHS Trust, said:  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an extremely common genetic condition. Earlier, small-scale studies suggested that variants in the ALPK3 gene could be a cause of a rare paediatric form of cardiomyopathy, but only when two abnormal copies were inherited. We have now proved that just one abnormal copy is enough to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults, looking at a large number of patients and families. This form of inheritance (autosomal dominant) is much more prevalent, as inheriting just one abnormal copy of a gene is more likely than inheriting two. Identifying a new genetic cause is important as it opens up new possibilities for potential treatment. It also helps families who have been affected by the condition, but who did not know why, to know that a cause has been found for their specific case. In the new study, an international team of researchers analysed the genomes of 2,817 people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referred from centres in Spain, the UK, Denmark, Russia, Latvia, Brazil, and Argentina. They compared the prevalence of the ALPK3 variants with that of the general population, finding it was 16 times more common.Researchers also studied the presence of the variant within families, testing whether or not it was causal by looking at whether the variant tracked with disease   that is, whether family members who had the variant also had the disease.The research team looked at the distinct nature of the disease compared to when it was caused by faults in the sarcomere genes   the primary way the disease is inherited. (They are named the sarcomere genes as their function relates to sarcomeres, the basic contractile unit, or primary building block, of muscle fibre.)They found that, in cases where the new gene is implicated, the disease was diagnosed later (at an average age of 56) but had similar rates of heart failure and heart transplantation as in cases linked to sarcomere genes.While little is known about the functional consequences of ALPK3 variants, they are believed to play a role in the regulation of protein function through a process of phosphorylation. Proteins are fundamental to the process of heart muscle cells contracting and relaxing. Dr Lopes said:  ALPK3 variants represent a different pathway to the disease than the other main known causes in the sarcomere genes. This discovery is exciting as it will establish new targets for therapies. We now need to explore mechanisms that explain how the ALPK3 variants are linked to the condition. In the UK, genetic testing is offered to all those diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in referral centres such as Barts Heart Centre, and, if there is a known genetic cause, to family members as well. While there is at the moment no cure, people with the condition are monitored regularly, medicated and one important intervention is the fitting of an implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), a device similar to a pacemaker that can give a strong electric shock to the heart if it detects a dangerously abnormal heartbeat.Reference: Lopes LR, Garcia-Hern ndez S, Lorenzini M, et al.

So the question becomes: Why? Was this variant favored in the past, and it fell out of evolutionary favor recently? Or is what we are observing just a blip among the complexity of genomes? The research provides new insights into the function of GHRd3 that may help explain why these evolutionary changes occurred, demonstrating that the variant may be useful in coping with nutritional stress. We think that this variant is beneficial where there are periods of starvation, which was the case for most of human evolution,  says Gokcumen, PhD, associate professor of biological sciences in the UB College of Arts and Sciences. With regard to GHRd3 s waning prominence in recent human history, he speculates that,  Maybe the rapid technological and cultural advances over the past 50,000 years have created a buffer against some of the fluctuations in resources that made GHRd3 so advantageous in the past. GHRd3 is interesting because it is a very common deletion that is variable between you and me among humans,  says Marie Saitou, PhD, tenure-track investigator at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and a former postdoctoral researcher in Gokcumen s lab at UB.  Normally, these kinds of important fundamental genes do not change between human to human, and are highly conserved in other animals even. The work was led by Saitou; Skyler Resendez, PhD, a recent UB graduate in biological sciences who is now a postdoctoral fellow in biomedical informatics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB; Xiuqian Mu, MD, PhD, associate professor of ophthalmology in the Jacobs School at UB and at the Ross Eye Institute; and Gokcumen. An international team of collaborators contributed perspectives in this study, which integrated advanced population genetics methods with research in a mouse model to understand the complicated history and function of a genetic variant.","Published: September 27, 2021"

Emissions of organic compounds from vegetation increase with increasing temperature, thus having the capability to slow down climate warming.Atmospheric aerosols scatter and absorb solar light, and influence the formation of clouds. However, these processes are not yet completely understood, which leads to significant uncertainties when estimating the role of aerosols in climate change. In order to reliably estimate the effect of humans on climate change, we need to be able to separate the effects of natural and anthropogenic aerosols.The study by Finnish researchers, published in Nature Communications, estimated the impact of volatile organic compounds emitted by boreal forests on aerosol concentration and cloud properties. The analysis was based on aerosol observations at the Hyyti l  SMEAR II station in Finland and remote sensing observations of cloud properties over Southern Finland from NASA s spaceborne MODIS instrument. The observations showed that biogenic aerosols formed from volatile organic compounds reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth s surface by scattering more radiation back to space. Furthermore, these aerosols increased the amount of cloud droplets and made clouds more reflective. Both processes become stronger as temperature increases, indicating that these natural aerosols can slow down the warming of climate. The magnitudes of the radiative effects of these processes are similar and their combined effect is significant when compared with the radiative effect of anthropogenic aerosols in the boreal region. Therefore, this natural mechanism needs to be considered in more detail in climate model simulations.The long-term and versatile observations from the SMEAR network and NASA s comprehensive satellite observations enable this kind of breakthrough research.Reference: Yli-Juuti T, Mielonen T, Heikkinen L, et al.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/origin-and-legacy-of-the-etruscans-354104,Origin and Legacy of the Etruscans A new study by a team of scholars from Germany  Italy  USA  Denmark and the UK  sheds light on the origin and legacy of the enigmatic Etruscans with genome wide data from    ancient individuals from central and southern Italy  spanning     BCE to      CE   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The Etruscan civilization, which flourished during the Iron Age in central Italy, has intrigued scholars for millennia. With remarkable metallurgical skills and a now-extinct, non-Indo-European language, the Etruscans stood out from their contemporary neighbors, leading to intense debate from the likes of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus on their geographical origins.Now, a new study by a team of scholars from Germany, Italy, USA, Denmark and the UK, sheds light on the origin and legacy of the enigmatic Etruscans with genome-wide data from 82 ancient individuals from central and southern Italy, spanning 800 BCE to 1000 CE. Their results show that the Etruscans, despite their unique cultural expressions, were closely related to their italic neighbors, and reveal major genetic transformations associated with historical events.An intriguing phenomenonWith an extinct language that is only partly understood, much of what was initially known about Etruscan civilization comes from the commentary of later Greek and Roman writers. One hypothesis about their origins, the one favored by Herodotus, points to the influence of ancient Greek cultural elements to argue that the Etruscans descended from migrating Anatolian or Aegean groups. Another, championed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, proposes that the Etruscans originated and developed locally from the Bronze Age Villanovan culture and were therefore an autochthonous population.Although the current consensus among archaeologists supports a local origin for the Etruscans, a lack of ancient DNA from the region has made genetic investigations inconsistent. The current study, with a time transect of ancient genomic information spanning almost 2000 years collected from 12 archaeological sites, resolves lingering questions about Etruscan origins, showing no evidence for a recent population movement from Anatolia. In fact, the Etruscans shared the genetic profile of the Latins living in nearby Rome, with a large proportion of their genetic profiles coming from steppe-related ancestry that arrived in the region during the Bronze Age.Considering that steppe-related groups were likely responsible for the spread of Indo-European languages, now spoken around the world by billions of people, the persistence of a non-Indo-European Etruscan language is an intriguing and still unexplained phenomenon that will require further archaeological, historical, linguistic and genetic investigation. This linguistic persistence, combined with a genetic turnover, challenges simple assumptions that genes equal languages and suggests a more complex scenario that may have involved the assimilation of early Italic speakers by the Etruscan speech community, possibly during a prolonged period of admixture over the second millennium BCE,  says David Caramelli, Professor at the University of Florence.Periods of changeDespite a few individuals of eastern Mediterranean, northern African, and central European origins, the Etruscan-related gene pool remained stable for at least 800 years, spanning the Iron Age and Roman Republic period. The study finds, however, that during the subsequent Roman Imperial period, central Italy experienced a large scale genetic shift, resulting from admixture with eastern Mediterranean populations, which likely included slaves and soldiers relocated across the Roman Empire. This genetic shift clearly depicts the role of the Roman Empire in the large-scale displacement of people in a time of enhanced upward or downward socioeconomic and geographic mobility,  says Johannes Krause, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.Looking at the more recent Early Middle Ages, the researchers identified northern European ancestries spreading across the Italian peninsula following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. These results suggest that Germanic migrants, including individuals associated with the newly established Longobard Kingdom, might have left a traceable impact on the genetic landscape of central Italy.In the regions of Tuscany, Lazio, and Basilicata the population s ancestry remained largely continuous between the Early Medieval times and today, suggesting that the main gene pool of present-day people from central and southern Italy was largely formed at least 1000 years ago.Although more ancient DNA from across Italy is needed to support the above conclusions, ancestry shifts in Tuscany and northern Lazio similar to those reported for the city of Rome and its surroundings suggests that historical events during the first millennium CE had a major impact on the genetic transformations over much of the Italian peninsula. The Roman Empire appears to have left a long-lasting contribution to the genetic profile of southern Europeans, bridging the gap between European and eastern Mediterranean populations on the genetic map of western Eurasia,  says Cosimo Posth, Professor at the University of T bingen and Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment.Reference: Posth Cosimo, Zaro Valentina, Spyrou Maria A., et al.

Importantly, scientists can use virtual tumours to optimise design of nanoparticle-based drugs before they are tested in the laboratory or patients.The paper, Evolutionary computational platform for the automatic discovery of nanocarriers for cancer treatment, published in the Nature journal Computational Materials, is the result of the European project EVONANO which involves Dr Sabine Hauert and Dr. Namid Stillman  from the University of Bristol, and is led by Dr Igor Balaz at the University of Novi Sad. Simulations enable us to test many treatments, very quickly, and for a large variety of tumours. We are still at the early stages of making virtual tumours, given the complex nature of the disease, but the hope is that even these simple digital tumours can help us more efficiently design nanomedicines for cancer,  said Dr Hauert.Dr Hauert said having the software to grow and treat virtual tumours could prove useful in the development of targeted cancer treatments. In the future, creating a digital twin of a patient tumour could enable the design of new nanoparticle treatments specialised for their needs, without the need for extensive trial and error or laboratory work, which is often costly and limited in its ability to quickly iterate on solutions suited for individual patients,  said Dr Hauert.Nanoparticle-based drugs have the potential for improved targeting of cancer cells. This is because nanoparticles are tiny vehicles that can be engineered to transport drugs to tumours. Their design changes their ability to move in the body, and correctly target cancer cells. A bioengineer might, for example, change the size, charge or material of the nanoparticle, coat the nanoparticles with molecules that make them easy to recognise by cancer cells, or load them with different drugs to kill cancer cells.Using the new EVONANO platform, the team were able to simulate simple tumours, and more complex tumours with cancer stem cells, which are sometimes difficult to treat and lead to relapse of some cancer patients. The strategy identified nanoparticle designs that were known to work in previous research, as well as potential new strategies for nanoparticle design.As Dr. Balaz highlights:  The tool we developed in EVONANO represents a rich platform for testing hypotheses on the efficacy of nanoparticles for various tumour scenarios. The physiological effect of tweaking nanoparticle parameters can now be simulated at the level of detail that is nearly impossible to achieve experimentally. The challenge is then to design the right nanoparticle. Using a machine learning technique called artificial evolution, the researchers fine tune nanoparticle designs until they can treat all scenarios tested while preserving healthy cells to limit potential side-effects.Dr. Stillman, co-lead author on the paper with Dr. Balaz, said:  This was a big team effort involving computational researchers across Europe over the past three years. I think this demonstrates the power of combining computer simulations with machine learning to find new and exciting ways to treat cancer. In the future, the team aims to use such a platform to bring digital twins closer to reality by using data from individual patients to grow virtual versions of their tumours, and then optimise treatments that are right for them. In the nearer term, the platform will be used to discover new nanoparticle strategies that can be tested in the laboratory. The software is open source, so there is also hope other researchers will use it to build their own AI-powered cancer nanomedicine. To get closer to clinical practice, in our future work we will focus on replicating tumour heterogeneity and drug resistance emergence. We believe these are the most important aspects of why cancer therapy for solid tumours often fails,  said Dr Balaz.Reference: Stillman NR, Balaz I, Tsompanas MA, et al.

The grant* helps to advance research on breast cancer, but it also fosters collaboration between the European and Californian cancer patient organizations.  Some cancer genes that help cancer grow also create weak spots in the cancer cells, which can be exploited with new drugs. In the breast cancer, MYC cancer gene reprograms cells to grow without pause but the uncontrolled growth also makes MYC carrying cancer cells prey to many different types of drugs. Researchers are getting better at finding drugs to target such specific cancer gene created vulnerabilities, and we hope to generate next generation cancer drugs that would kill only cancer cells but leave normal cells unharmed. Even further, we hope that these new drugs would also incite the body s immunity to fight cancer , says the study leader, FICAN Research Professor Juha Klefstr m, Ph.D from the University of Helsinki. Our joint groups at the University of Helsinki and UCSF have discovered that the MYC oncogene is associated with poor breast cancer patient outcomes and resistance to immunotherapies.  The Breakthrough Award will allow us to discover improved treatments that seek to selectively kill high-MYC tumor cells and improve response to immune treatments.

It can be resistant to treatment and the survival rate is low compared to other cancers, with only a 5-10% survival rate five years after diagnosis.The study was led by Professors Alvaro Mata from the University of Nottingham (UK), Daniela Loessner from Monash University (Australia) and Christopher Heeschen from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China). Dr David Osuna de la Pe a, a lead researcher on the project, said: ""There are two main obstacles to treating pancreatic cancer -- a very dense matrix of proteins and the presence of highly resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are involved in relapse and metastasis. In our study, we have engineered a matrix where CSCs can interact with other cell types and together behave more like they do in the body, opening the possibility to test different treatments in a more realistic manner.""There is a need for improved 3D cancer models to study tumour growth and progression in patients and test responses to new treatments. At present, 90% of successful cancer treatments tested pre-clinically fail in the early phases of clinical trials and less than 5% of oncology drugs are successful in clinical trials.Pre-clinical tests mostly rely on a combination of two-dimensional (2D) lab grown cell cultures and animal models to predict responses to treatment. However, conventional 2D cell cultures fail to mimic key features of tumour tissues and interspecies differences can result in many successful treatments in animal hosts being ineffective in humans.Consequently, novel experimental 3D cancer models are needed to better recreate the human tumour microenvironment and incorporate patient-specific differences.Self-assembly is the process by which biological systems controllably assemble multiple molecules and cells into functional tissues. Harnessing this process, the team created a new hydrogel biomaterial made with multiple, yet specific, proteins found in pancreatic cancer. This mechanism of formation enables incorporation of key cell types to create biological environments that can emulate features of a patient's tumour.Professor Mata adds: ""Using models of human cancer is becoming more common in developing treatments for the disease, but a major barrier to getting them into clinical applications is the turnaround time. We have engineered a comprehensive and tuneable ex vivo model of pancreative ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by assembling and organising key matrix components with patient-derived cells. The models exhibit patient-specific transcriptional profiles, CSC functionality, and strong tumourigenicity; overall providing a more relevant scenario than Organoid and Sphere cultures. Most importantly, drug responses were better reproduced in our self-assembled cultures than in the other models.We believe this model moves closer to the vision of being able to take patient tumour cells in hospital, incorporate them into our model, find the optimum cocktail of treatments for a particular cancer and deliver it back to the patient -- all within a short timeframe. Although this vision for precision medicine for treating this disease is still a way off, this research provides a step towards realising it.""Reference: Osuna de la Pe a D, Trabulo SMD, Collin E, et al.

The new study, however, shows that noninvasive radiation therapy normally used to treat cancer can reprogram the heart muscle cells to a younger and perhaps healthier state, fixing the electrical problem in the cells themselves without needing scar tissue to block the overactive circuits. The study also suggests that the same cellular reprogramming effect could be achieved with lower doses of radiation, opening the door to the possibility of wider uses for radiation therapy in different types of cardiac arrhythmias.Physician-scientists at Washington University showed in 2017 that radiation therapy typically reserved for cancer treatment could be directed at the heart to treat ventricular tachycardia.In theory, radiation therapy could reproduce the scar tissue usually created through catheter ablation but with a much shorter and totally noninvasive procedure, making the treatment available to more severely ill patients. Surprisingly, the doctors found that patients experienced large improvements in their arrhythmias a few days to weeks after radiation therapy, much quicker than the months it can take scar tissue to form after radiation therapy, suggesting that a single dose of radiation reduces the arrhythmia without forming scar tissue. The data indicated that radiation treatment worked just as well, if not better, than catheter ablation for certain patients with ventricular tachycardia but in a different and unknown way. Traditionally, catheter ablation creates scar tissue to block the electrical circuits that are causing ventricular tachycardia,  said senior author and cardiologist Stacey L. Rentschler, MD, PhD, an associate professor of medicine, of developmental biology and of biomedical engineering.  To help us understand whether the same thing was happening with radiation therapy, some of the first patients to have this new treatment gave us permission to study their heart tissue   following heart transplantation or if they had passed away for another reason, for example. We saw that scar tissue alone could not explain the remarkable clinical effects, suggesting that radiation improves the arrhythmia in some other way, so we delved into the details of that. The scientists found that radiation treatment triggered heart muscle cells to begin expressing different genes. They measured increased activity in a signaling pathway called Notch, which is known for its vital role in early development, including in forming the heart s electrical conduction system.Notch is usually switched off in adult heart muscle cells. But the researchers found that a single dose of radiation temporarily activates Notch signaling, leading to a long-term increase in sodium ion channels in the heart muscle, a key physiologic change that can reduce arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are associated with slow electrical conduction speeds,  Rentschler said.  Radiation therapy seems to kick up the speed faster by activating early developmental pathways that revert the heart tissue back into a healthier state. The researchers studied these effects in mice and in donated human hearts. In the human heart samples, the researchers found that these changes in heart muscle cells were only present in areas of the heart that received the targeted radiation dose. Radiation does cause a type of injury, but it s different from catheter ablation,  said co-author and radiation oncologist Julie K. Schwarz, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Cancer Biology Division in the Department of Radiation Oncology.  As part of the body s response to that injury, cells in the injured portion of the heart appear to turn on some of these early developmental programs to repair themselves. It s important to understand how this works because, with that knowledge, we can improve the way we re treating these patients and then apply it to other diseases. The researchers also found that the beneficial effects of radiation continued for at least two years in surviving patients. And importantly, they were able to demonstrate in mice that a lower dose of the radiation produced the same effect. A lower radiation dose could minimize long-term side effects and open the door to this type of treatment in other types of heart arrhythmias. And while Notch was a big player in these effects, Schwarz said it s not the only pathway involved. The researchers are continuing to investigate how radiation triggers heart cells to revert to a healthier state.Added first author David M. Zhang, an MD/PhD student in Rentschler s lab:  This was an exciting collaboration not only between basic scientists and clinicians but also cardiologists and radiation oncologists. Historically, radiation oncologists are focused on cancer and try to avoid irradiating the heart, so this study opens up a whole new area of research and collaboration between these two fields.

Lurie Children s Hospital of Chicago, and colleagues, found that overexpression of a growth factor receptor (called PDGFRA) in a mouse model did not cause tumors, as anticipated. Instead, they observed severe hypomyelination, which manifested as impaired balance, and hindlimb and tail tremors. Their findings were published in the journal Brain and Behavior. Our study provides a new model for studying hypomyelination,  said Dr. Becher, senior author on the study, Rory David Deutsch Malignant Brain Tumor Research Scholar at Lurie Children s and Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  Blocking this receptor might prove to be a novel strategy to treat myelination disorders like multiple sclerosis. Of course, more research is needed to confirm our results and explore further. Dr. Becher pointed out that the current study focused on prenatal events, which might explain why no tumors were formed, since timing is very important in cancer development. We saw that too much PDGFRA interfered with differentiation of progenitor cells that give rise to cells that make myelin,  said Dr. Becher.  These progenitor cells, which continue to be generated throughout the human lifespan, are known to be the cell of origin for brain tumors like diffuse midline glioma. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms we observed might spur brain tumor development at a postnatal stage. I would like to express my profound gratitude to the Rory David Deutsch Foundation and Lurie Children s for their vision, confidence and support of this research,  said Dr. Becher.Research at Ann & Robert H.

Kusma, MD, MS, a pediatrician at Lurie Children s and Instructor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  In the past few months, Lurie Children s physicians have frequently appeared in the media reassuring parents about the safety, effectiveness and importance of vaccinating their children. The insights from our study about trusted sources of information, however, along with our demographic findings, will help with more targeted outreach that hopefully will get more children vaccinated against COVID-19 and bring us closer to herd immunity.  Dr. Kusma and colleagues surveyed parents of children younger than 18 years of age living in the Chicago metropolitan area and the surrounding suburbs that make up Cook County, Illinois. Theyanalyzed responses from 1,425 participants. Overall, 33 percent of parents reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for their child.  As vaccines are becoming available to younger children, and with continued spikes in COVID-19 cases, it is of the utmost importance that we are able to widely distribute the vaccine,  said Dr. Kusma.  We especially need to reach the more vulnerable and hesitant populations to help reduce the substantial health inequities we have seen during this pandemic.

Specifically, they examined the importance of the frontal cortex, the portion of the brain used in decision-making, expressive language and voluntary movement.And the two scientists learned that a recurrent neural network structure, or RNN, is responsible for those functions. This RNN receives inputs from emotional regions of the brain and sends outputs to the motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for voluntary movement,  says Qian-Quan Sun, a UW professor of zoology and physiology.  In the artificial intelligence field, computer scientists have designed various artificial neural networks, including RNNs, which effectively solve problems, such as language translation and object recognition, by simulating the neural network in the mammalian brain. This paper provides a basic structure of neural networks in the mammalian brain. This basic structure will guide us in investigating behavioral strategy,  Sun continues.  After more details are acquired, we may translate it to an artificial neural network, using it to solve real-world problems. Sun, director of UW s Wyoming Sensory Biology Center of Biomedical Research Excellence, is the lead author of a paper titled  A Long-Range Recurrent Neuronal Network Linking the Emotion Regions with Somatic Motor Cortex  that was published today (Tuesday) in Cell Reports. The open-access journal publishes peer-reviewed papers across the entire life sciences spectrum that report new biological insight.The first author of the paper is Yihan Wang, a Ph.D. student in UW s Doctoral Neuroscience Program, from Beijing, China. The research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.Artificial RNNs are important deep-learning algorithms that are commonly used for ordinal or temporal lobe problems, such as language translation, natural language processing, speech recognition and image captioning, Sun says. An RNN recognizes sequential characteristics in data and uses patterns to predict the next likely scenario. RNNs are incorporated into popular applications such as Siri, Google Voice Search and Google Translate. The biggest surprise is that RNNs not only exist in our brain, but they are constructed with much more delicate function and, yet, highly efficient in processing sequential inputs,  Sun says.  In general, cortical neurons are spatially reciprocal and intermingle with each other. However, Wang s data not only showed that the RNN does exist in the most important part of the brain -- the frontal cortex -- but additionally, this network is less complex than we thought and mostly unidirectional. This is a big surprise to us, because this tells us that this network may be in charge of unique functions when compared with others. Sun and Wang analyzed the brains of mice for the lab research. Different genetically modified mouse strains provided the two with the ability to label specific types of neurons with fluorescent proteins that follow the brain s connections -- and to monitor the activities of specific neurons with intrinsically fluorescent markers.The research has many real-world implications, according to Sun. One, now that we know of this important building block, the work will help further decipher how our brain makes decisions,  he says.  Two, it will help uncover other similar RNNs in other parts of the brain. It will help researchers use computational simulations to predict how our brain codes short-term memory, and how can it be used. And three, specifically for this study, it will help us understand how emotions, such as fear and anxiety, regulate our movements. Both the content and research approach used by Sun and Wang should have very broad interests with artificial intelligence researchers, biologists, computational modelers and neuroscientists, Sun says. The precise connection map also may help us understand the cause of the neurological and psychiatric disorders where there are problems with the regulation of emotions or voluntary movement,  Sun says.  However, before this finding can have wider applications, there are lots of details -- such as how the local inhibitory network refined the RNN, and how different components underlie specific emotion states -- that still need to be figured out. Wang s goal is to work out these details in his dissertation work, Sun says.Reference: Wang Y, Sun Q-Q.

His skeleton had suggested that he might have some African ancestry.  Most of Spain had been progressively conquered by Arabs and Berbers from Northwest Africa from the eighth century onwards, creating one of the major centres of medieval European civilisation.The ancient DNA analysis was carried out by Dr Marina Silva and Dr Gonzalo Oteo-Garcia, who had been working on the University s Leverhulme Trust doctoral scholarship programme in evolutionary genomics.  They found that the  Giant  carried highly specific North African genetic lineages on both his male and female lines of descent   the Y-chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA   the oldest individual known to have this particular pattern of ancestry. This suggested that his recent ancestry was indeed amongst the newly Islamicised Berber populations of medieval Northwest Africa.But a more detailed examination revealed a more complex situation. The male and female lines of descent account for only a small fraction of our overall ancestry   that from our father s father s father and our mother s mother s mother, and so on. His genome-wide ancestry showed that he also carried a significant amount   likely more than half   of local Spanish ancestry in his chromosomes.  .  Moreover, stable isotope analyses suggested that he most likely grew up locally meaning the  Giant s  Berber ancestry was in fact due to migration from an earlier generation. He therefore belonged to a settled community that had thoroughly intermixed local Spanish and immigrant North African ancestry. Professor Martin RichardsProfessor Martin Richards, Director of the Evolutionary Genomics Research Centre.What was especially striking, revealed Professor Martin Richards, Director of the University s Evolutionary Genomics Research Centre, was that he was very unlike modern people from Valencia, who carry little or none of his Berber genetic heritage.This can be explained by the changing political situation following the Christian reconquest of Spain as Dr Oteo-Garcia, who recently commenced work at the University of Parma, explained:  The decree of expulsion of Moriscos  from the Valencia region, that is, Muslims who had already been forcibly converted to Christianity, was followed by the resettlement by people from further north, who had little North African ancestry, thereby transforming the genetic variation in the region.  Dr Silva, who now works at London s Francis Crick Institute, said:  The impact of this dramatic change in population, resulting from a brutal political decision hundreds of years ago, can finally be witnessed directly using ancient DNA, as seen here in the ancestry of the  Segorbe Giant  and his contemporaries.

When we reflect on our past behaviour and decisions, we can normally identify both occasions where we have been true to ourselves, i.e. acted authentically, as well as times when we have done things in a way that doesn t align with who we believe we are. How do, however, these recollections translate onto the story of who we are that we tell ourselves every day? A new study, conducted at the University of Waikato (New Zealand) by Dr Anna Sutton and Jason Render and published in the open-access academic journal Social Psychological Bulletin, is the first to provide evidence that autobiographical memories of authentic and inauthentic experiences serve specific purposes that might be highly beneficial in the long term. In their research, the psychologists used data collected from a set of questionnaires, where people reflected on their authenticity at their workplaces. This particular context was selected due to earlier evidence pointing to the advantage of studying personal authenticity in an environment where the individual interacts with organisational constraints like job requirements or power imbalances, hence might feel prompted to act against their beliefs, in order to serve a larger purpose or achieve a specific goal.Having analysed the data, the researchers concluded that when we think about our past actions that were authentic, we use the memory to define or enhance our sense of identity and self-knowledge. Authenticity can increase the level of our self-fulfilment: a phenomenon recognised by both psychologists and philosophers.  Data from the past decades has provided strong support for this view by demonstrating that authenticity is positively related to engagement in work and to well-being in general, and is therefore of distinct value for individuals, employing organisations and society at large,  further explains Sutton. The team elaborates on their findings by pointing out that an individual uses memories of past experiences to develop continuity and coherence in their self-concept.   For example, a memory of the past may be used to determine the extent to which one has changed or developed over time. This evaluation is seen as providing a link between who I am now and who I was then, creating a coherent developmental understanding of sometimes discrepant behaviours or attitudes.  However, memories of inauthentic actions - unlike the feeling of inauthenticity itself - do not necessarily translate into a negative experience. Quite the opposite, in fact, thinking about times when we haven t been true to ourselves has an adaptive function within the greater plot of our lives.These recollections of inauthenticity serve a directive function, conclude the researchers. They help us navigate through subsequent situations, plan for the future and improve our problem-solving skills. These memories can prompt us to direct our future behaviour towards a more authentic response.   This is a small-scale study,  says Dr Sutton,  so of course we need to explore this area further. But it s very exciting that we re starting to see how we use memories of authentic and inauthentic experiences in quite different ways, and that both can be beneficial.   By clarifying these memory functions, we hope to have provided the basis for developing future interventions that may improve authenticity and well-being,  concludes the team.","Published: September 24, 2021"

Globally, different languages have divvied up the world of color using their own set of labels, from just a few to dozens.The question of how humans have done this ascribe a finite vocabulary to the multitude of perceivable colors has been long studied, and consistent patterns have emerged, even across wildly divergent languages and cultures. Yet slight differences among languages persist, and what is less understood is how the differing communicative needs of local cultures drive those differences. Do some cultures need to talk about certain colors more than others, and how does that shape their language?In a new study, researchers led by Colin Twomey, a postdoc in Penn s MindCORE program, and Joshua Plotkin, a professor in the School of Arts & Sciences  Biology Department, address these questions, developing an algorithm capable of inferring a culture s communicative needs the imperative to talk about certain colors using previously collected data from 130 diverse languages.Their findings underscore that, indeed, cultures across the globe differ in their need to communicate about certain colors. Linking almost all languages, however, is an emphasis on communicating about warm colors reds and yellows that are known to draw the human eye and that correspond with the colors of ripe fruits in primate diets.The work, a collaboration that included Penn linguist Gareth Roberts and psychologist David Brainard, is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The fact that color vocabularies could be an efficient representation of the communicative needs of colors is an idea that s been around for 20 years,  says Twomey.  It struck me that, OK, if this is our idea about how color vocabularies are formed, then we could go in reverse and ask,  Well, what would have been the communicative needs that would have been necessary for this vocabulary to arrive at its present form?  It s a hard problem, but I had an intuition that it was a solvable one. The color-word problem is a classical one: How do you map the infinitude of colors to a discrete number of words?  says Plotkin.  Colin noticed an evolutionary interpretation of the problem. It s as if the different terms are competing for what colors they will be used to represent. That was a key mathematical insight that allows us to infer the communicative needs of colors in each of these 130 languages. The study relied on a robust dataset known as the World Color Survey, collected more than 50 years ago by anthropologist Brent Berlin and linguist Paul Kay. Traveling to 130 linguistic communities worldwide, Berlin and Kay presented native speakers with the same 330 color chips. They found that even completely different languages tended to group colors in roughly the same way. What s more, when they asked speakers to identify the focal color of a particular named color the  reddest red  or  greenest green speakers  choices were highly similar across languages. Their results were so astonishing,  Plotkin says.  They demanded explanation. Substantial research followed, some of which suggested that one major reason for the remarkable similarities between languages  color vocabularies came down to physiology. Languages differ, cultures differ, but our eyes are the same,  says Plotkin.But another reason for the overarching similarities could be that humans, regardless of what language they speak, are more interested in talking about certain colors than others.The Penn team used data from the World Color Survey on focal colors to work backwards, going from speakers  observations of the reddest red or greenest green to infer the communicative need associated with each of the 330 colors in the survey. What was really surprising was that we could use just those best-example colors to say what those communicative needs would have been,  says Twomey.The researchers were able to use the second part of the World Color Survey data, on how languages divided color, to validate that their inference algorithm could predict the communicative needs of different languages.Their analysis underscores findings from earlier research, that warm-hued colors have a higher communicative need.  On average across languages, the reds and yellows have 30-fold greater demand than other colors,  Plotkin says. No one really cares about brownish greens, and pastels aren t super well represented in communicative needs,  Twomey adds.The researchers also looked at existing data on fruit-eating primates with color vision systems like our own. These primates tend to eat ripe fruit with colors that line up almost precisely with the places in the color spectrum with high communicative need.  Fruits are a way for a plant to spread its seeds, hitching a ride with the animals that eat them. Fruit-producing plants likely evolved to stand out to these animals. The relationship with the colors of ripe fruit tells us that communicative needs are likely related to the colors that stand out to us the most,  says Twomey.  To be clear, this doesn t say that we have the communicative needs we have because we need to communicate about fruit specifically. The team s algorithm could predict not only the similarities but also the differences between languages. While an emphasis on reds and yellows was universal, certain languages also had high communicative needs for blues, while greens turned up as important in other languages. The research team found that some of these differences were associated with biogeography and distance. Cultures that shared similar ecoregions were more similar in their communicative needs around colors, perhaps owing to plants or animals in that region that were important for food or other uses.This approach to the study of communicative needs opens up many other areas for study.  This is something that could be carried to other systems where there is a need to divide up some cognitive space,  says Twomey,  whether it s sound, weight, temperature, or something else. And using this framework also opens up opportunities for pursuing various questions around color and language. Now that we have inferred how often people want to talk about certain colors today, we can take a phylogeny of languages and try to infer what people were talking about 500 or 1,000 years ago. What historical events coincide with changes in our needs to talk about colors?  Plotkin says.  There is tons of work still to be done here. Such questions will demand unique collaborations like the one undergirded by MindCORE, a campus hub for study of human intelligence and behavior which enabled this work.  Inherently interdisciplinary questions like the ones we tackle in our paper together can be challenging to work on precisely because it takes a team of experts from different fields to answer them,  Twomey says.  So I feel very fortunate to have had MindCORE's support here at Penn to assemble exactly the right team for this problem. Reference: Twomey CR, Roberts G, Brainard DH, Plotkin JB.

The study appears in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier.The authors, led by Rick Adams, PhD, at University College London, used electroencephalography (EEG), a noninvasive technique that measures brain waves, to collect data from 107 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 57 of their relatives and 108 control participants. The EEGs of people with schizophrenia displayed hallmark signs including increased theta waves. The nature of brain circuit changes in schizophrenia is unclear,  said Dr. Adams.  Is it too much excitation or not enough, or too much inhibition or not enough, or some combination? To find out, Dr. Adams and colleagues used computational modeling of the EEG data, which showed that the EEG differences seen in people diagnosed with schizophrenia resulted from decreased synaptic gain. This means that excitatory neurons had a diminished ability to stimulate one another. Symptoms of schizophrenia including auditory hallucinations, however, were associated with a loss of neural inhibition, especially in auditory brain areas. This might mean that the loss of excitation comes first, and the brain tries to compensate for this by reducing inhibition, but then this leads to hallucinations,  Dr. Adams said.  Imagine you are trying to listen to someone speaking on the radio, but the signal is very weak; if you turn the volume up, the speech is louder but so is all the static and background noise and so you may mistake some of this noise for actual speech. Something analogous might be happening in brain circuits in schizophrenia.

It s the basics of the beef industry.However, reproductive inefficiency costs the beef industry billions every year. Most of that is driven by embryonic mortality and pregnancy loss, said Ky Pohler, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Animal Science and chair of the Pregnancy and Developmental Programming Area of Excellence at the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. We re conducting a series of studies to evaluate what s really important to the developing pregnancy,  Pohler said.  We want to determine how much of the loss is coming from the physiology of the animal vs. how much is genetic. When a cow loses a pregnancy or undergoes embryonic mortality, the cow may not get pregnant again in that breeding season. Beef producers are paid on pounds of calf weaned or a live calf,  Pohler said.  If there is no calf born, then there s no profit. And the producer s input costs continue to increase. Our cow-calf operations must get more efficient, or we won t be able to maintain them. A recent $500,000 Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture will fund Pohler s project to advance understanding of embryonic mortality and pregnancy loss in the cow.The project, Physiological Function of Prostaglandins and Pregnancy Associated Glycoproteins in Late Embryonic Mortality in Cattle, is part of a series of studies Pohler is conducting to evaluate various aspects of a developing pregnancy.Successful completion of the study is expected to provide foundational information on the physiological and molecular mechanisms associated with embryonic survival and mortality in beef cattle. This knowledge will lead to a better understanding of the causes and potential strategies to prevent such reproductive loss, which is causing major economic problems for the beef and dairy industries.Applying genetic knockout technologyThe new grant allows Pohler s team to study gene knockouts, utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in cattle. You basically knock out a single gene and see what happens with the developing embryo when you do that. Does the pregnancy develop forward, or does it terminate right there?  he said.  We re excited to start using this technology in our projects to really understand pregnancy and developmental programming. Pohler said their study aims to show the impact of a gene family called pregnancy associated glycoproteins or PAGS. These proteins have been known for years; they are the foundation for blood and milk-based pregnancy testing in cattle. The team will remove those genes one by one to determine if they are important to the developing pregnancy. We know ways to minimize pregnancy loss,  he said.  But we don t know how to eliminate it, because we don t know what the true causes are. This is an opportunity to understand the causes and then develop management strategies specific to those causes. Developing more than a band-aid for beef cattle pregnancy lossThe No. 1 economically important thing on a cow-calf operation is pregnancy. All the other things we do are important, but pregnancy is 20 times more financially important than any other production trait,  Pohler said.  If you take it all the way to the consumer level, if you don t have the pregnancy, you will never realize the potential of that animal to generate a steak for the consumer. That is why he is concentrating on ending embryonic mortality.Pohler said he tells people the industry s current practices are like putting a band-aid on the situation    like, I know if I do this, it will help me decrease it, but it doesn t help me eliminate it. So, we want to understand what the real mechanisms are and how do you eliminate it. Will pregnancy loss ever be completely eliminated? No, Pohler said. But we can develop genetic tests. We can develop other types of tools to help minimize that loss. I think what we will be able to do is develop better management strategies. One of the other projects Pohler and his team are working on is to determine how much contribution to embryonic mortality comes from the bull and how much from the cow. We re studying all sides of it,  he said.  This project is really female-focused. But there is a whole opportunity on the bull side as well. And I think understanding both sides is going to be critical. If it ends up being on the bull side, and you can develop a genetic test, there are a lot fewer bulls than there are cows. So, you can make a lot bigger impact in a shorter time. If it ends up being on the cow side, it will take a lot longer time to make that impact. Utilizing technology at the ranch levelCurrently, Pohler estimates only about 25% of beef producers utilize pregnancy diagnosis in their herds, even though the technology has been around for years.Utilizing pregnancy diagnosis can help determine when an animal loses a pregnancy. With technology and better management practices, that producer can be more efficient in generating calves, have animals with better genetics than the previous year, and produce a more uniform calf crop. All these things work toward making a producer s beef cattle operation more financially sustainable. Don t adopt technology for the sake of adopting technology,  Pohler said.  Use the technology you need to get where you need to go. You have to capture the value on it. This article has been republished from the following materials.

Ultimately, it might be used to treat lead-contaminated water supplies at the home level, or to treat contaminated water from some chemical or industrial processes.The new system is the latest in a series of applications based on initial findings six years ago by members of the same research team, initially developed for desalination of seawater or brackish water, and later adapted for removing radioactive compounds from the cooling water of nuclear power plants. The new version is the first such method that might be applicable for treating household water supplies, as well as industrial uses.The findings are published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology   Water, in a paper by MIT graduate students Huanhuan Tian, Mohammad Alkhadra, and Kameron Conforti, and professor of chemical engineering Martin Bazant. It s notoriously difficult to remove toxic heavy metal that s persistent and present in a lot of different water sources,  Alkhadra says.  Obviously there are competing methods today that do this function, so it s a matter of which method can do it at lower cost and more reliably. The biggest challenge in trying to remove lead is that it is generally present in such tiny concentrations, vastly exceeded by other elements or compounds. For example, sodium is typically present in drinking water at a concentration of tens of parts per million, whereas lead can be highly toxic at just a few parts per billion. Most existing processes, such as reverse osmosis or distillation, remove everything at once, Alkhadra explains. This not only takes much more energy than would be needed for a selective removal, but it s counterproductive since small amounts of elements such as sodium and magnesium are actually essential for healthy drinking water.The new approach uses a process called shock electrodialysis, in which an electric field is used to produce a shockwave inside an electrically charged porous material carrying the contaminated water. The shock wave propagates from one side to the other as the voltage increases, leaving behind a zone where the metal ions are depleted, and separating the feed stream into a brine and a fresh stream. The process results in a 95 percent reduction of lead from the outgoing fresh stream.In principle,  this makes the process much cheaper,  Bazant says,  because the electrical energy that you re putting in to do the separation is really going after the high-value target, which is the lead. You re not wasting a lot of energy removing the sodium.  Because the lead is present at such low concentration,  there s not a lot of current involved in removing those ions, so this can be a very cost-effective way. The process still has its limitations, as it has only been demonstrated at small laboratory scale and at quite slow flow rates. Scaling up the process to make it practical for in-home use will require further research, and larger-scale industrial uses will take even longer. But it could be practical within a few years for some home-based systems, Bazant says.For example, a home whose water supply is heavily contaminated with lead might have a system in the cellar that slowly processes a stream of water, filling a tank with lead-free water to be used for drinking and cooking, while leaving most of the water untreated for uses like toilet flushing or watering the lawn. Such uses might be appropriate as an interim measure for places like Flint, Michigan, where the water, mostly contaminated by the distribution pipes, will take many years to remediate through pipe replacements.The process could also be adapted for some industrial uses such as cleaning water produced in mining or drilling operations, so that the treated water can be safely disposed of or reused. And in some cases, this could also provide a way of recovering metals that contaminate water but could actually be a valuable product if they were separated out; for example, some such minerals could be used to process semiconductors or pharmaceuticals or other high-tech products, the researchers say.Direct comparisons of the economics of such a system versus existing methods is difficult, Bazant says, because in filtration systems, for example, the costs are mainly for replacing the filter materials, which quickly clog up and become unusable, whereas in this system the costs are mostly for the ongoing energy input, which is very small. At this point, the shock electrodialysis system has been operated for several weeks, but it s too soon to estimate the real-world longevity of such a system, he says.Developing the process into a scalable commercial product will take some time, but  we have shown how this could be done, from a technical standpoint,  Bazant says.  The main issue would be on the economic side,  he adds. That includes figuring out the most appropriate applications and developing specific configurations that would meet those uses.  We do have a reasonable idea of how to scale this up. So it s a question of having the resources,  which might be a role for a startup company rather than an academic research lab, he adds. I think this is an exciting result,  he says,  because it shows that we really can address this important application  of cleaning the lead from drinking water. For example, he says, there are places now that perform desalination of seawater using reverse osmosis, but they have to run this expensive process twice in a row, first to get the salt out, and then again to remove the low-level but highly toxic contaminants like lead. This new process might be used instead of the second round of reverse osmosis, at a far lower expenditure of energy.Reference: Tian H, Alkhadra MA, Conforti KM, Bazant MZ.

Sun and his team developed a groundbreaking method of applying software to the OCT tool to provide polarization-sensitive capabilities   without the cost and complexity that accompany hardware-based PS-OCT imaging systems. We re trying to replace the hardware associated with PS-OCT,  Sun said.  However, [it] is still in the stage of development and research. By adding a deep learning model on top of an OCT system, suddenly we arrive at PS-OCT capabilities without the traditional added hardware. OCT is a non-invasive imaging test that uses light waves to determine the properties of a biological sample. However, by enabling the tool to use polarization sensitivity, scientists can detect relevant information that OCT cannot capture on its own. For instance: OCT can differentiate tissue in a manner that s precise and when larger features are clear; PS-OCT can detect abnormalities on a deeper level, differentiating microstructural features such as collagen fiber orientations that change in a cancer-infected area compared to a normal area. We proved that applying our method to other systems can generate a PS-OCT contrast, and that this model can be used on many OCT systems to help us differentiate cancer tissues and other types of tissues much better than OCT systems alone,  Sun said.  This is a huge improvement, making this system better for cancer diagnoses. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, enabled Sun s team to create software that can pair with OCT systems to deliver polarization sensitivity. Deep learning enabled a more advanced method of picking up subtle features in images, which can be used for more accurate segmentation and classification. It also allows the imaging tool to use multiple layers to pick up spatial features in an image,  Sun said.By applying historical data, the deep learning methods assist with accurate diagnoses and even medical predictions. Sun's team tested their model by predicting what a photo of a lush summer forest might look like in December: barren, grey, perhaps a smattering of ice and snow in the trees. With this concept in mind, the images from OCT systems, coupled with this deep learning approach, can even predict the PS-OCT images that would have come from the more complex and costly PS-OCT systems. Edwin s study truly highlights the power and potential of AI and deep learning approaches to predict and generate synthetic PS-OCT images from standard OCT images, a type of image-to-image translation. With the increasing use of OCT across medical fields, this advance will likely have a broad impact, and ultimately help to improve the detection and diagnosis of disease,  said Boppart, Sun s Ph.D. thesis advisor who is both a physician and UIUC professor of engineering.This research was supported in part by grants from the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health.Reference: Sun Y, Wang J, Shi J, Boppart SA.

The findings provide new insight into the inner workings of the immune system and may help understand how tissues develop and how certain cancers arise.The study, published Sept. 23 in Nature Immunology, combined computational analyses with advanced molecular biology and genomic techniques to identify a protein called Oct2 as the key determinant of the B-cell humoral immune response.During an infection or after a vaccination, mature B cells form germinal centers, a sort of pop-up training facility. There, the cells mutate and rearrange their antibody-encoding genes, until they either produce an improved antibody or die trying. The process is central to the body's responses to many pathogens, but it's also fraught with danger; poorly-placed B cell mutations can cause lymphoid cancers.""All of our cells have defense mechanisms against becoming mutated, but B cells actually do the opposite; they specialize in mutating, and they do it very fast,"" said co-senior author Dr. Ari Melnick, the Gebroe Family Professor of Hematology / Oncology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.Previous studies showed that B cells control their germinal center maturation by altering the accessibility of different parts of their genomes, and triggering cascades of gene expression changes to direct and limit their development. But what coordinates all of those signals?To answer that question, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences student Ashley Doane, along with colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine and The Rockefeller University, first took a computational approach, mapping all the gene regulation changes maturing B cells undergo.""We started off creating an atlas of all the regulatory elements that come into being and disappear over that period of time,"" said Dr. Melnick. By developing new computational methods, the team was able to deconvolute the changes to identify OCT2 as the molecule that appeared to be at the root of the process.But the distribution of OCT2 in germinal centers was surprisingly similar to its distribution in mature B-cells prior to their activation.  Probing B cells with new genomic and molecular tools in the lab, the researchers found OCT2 in immature B cells pre-positioned in the genome locations where it would later operate during the germinal center reaction. Another gene regulatory protein, OCA-B, triggers the genome locations marked by OCT2 to become active, turning them into ""super-enhancers"" that drive the rest of the B cell maturation regulatory network.""The destiny of the cell is predetermined in a way, so that if it gets the right signal, it will know how to create the germinal center B cell,"" said Dr. Melnick.The notion of cellular predestination - and the identification of a specific mechanism for it - may be the paper's most far-reaching discovery.""I think that's potentially a profound finding that could apply to many different transitions between cell types,"" said co-senior author Dr. Olivier Elemento, who is director of the Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine and associate director of the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.During embryonic development, for example, a single cell divides and matures into all of the cells of a complete organism, following a series of branching decision points that may use similar mechanisms to mark super-enhancers for later activation.Targeting master regulators such as OCT2 and OCA-B, or their counterparts in other cell types, could also provide a powerful new way to attack cancer.""Very often what you'll see is if a gene is really important in terms of maintaining the cancer state, that gene will tend to be regulated by a super-enhancer,"" said Dr. Elemento, who is also professor of physiology and biophysics and professor of computational genomics in computational biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.  Cancer cells rely on them as a way to maintain their identity.""Disrupting tumor cells' ability to form critical cell-type, specific super-enhancers could effectively pull the rug out from under them, shutting down their entire survival strategy.Reference: Doane AS, Chu C-S, Di Giammartino DC, et al.

The Hedge Design for the Abatement of Traffic Emissions (HedgeDATE) online tool allows users to describe their environment -- such as a road with buildings on one side -- and then recommends actions citizens can take to improve its air quality.  For example, HedgeDATE advises that a resident living in a shallow street canyon should install hedges and a green wall; the tool can also give more detailed information on the species of plants suitable for different locations.  The development of HedgeDATE builds on years of research and public engagement work by the University of Surrey s Global Centre for Clean Air Research (GCARE). HedgeDATE grew out of workshops on air pollution mitigation conducted with local communities as part of Guildford Living Lab*.  Professor Prashant Kumar, founding director of GCARE and founder of the Guildford Living Lab at the University of Surrey, said:  The best use of research is for public benefit. However, this poses the challenge of translating complex science into simple, evidence-based actions. At GCARE, we proactively engage with the community and produce co-designed solutions such as HedgeDATE. Soon, when the world is back on its feet after the pandemic, we will need to come to terms with the air pollution and climate change crisis.  HedgeDATE is about giving ordinary people -- our schools, hospitals and councils -- easy-to-use tools that can inspire them to make a real difference to the quality of the air they breathe.  Justine Fuller, co-author of the paper on HedgeDATE from Guildford Borough Council, said:  We have been collaborating with Professor Kumar s team for many years. The HedgeDATE tool is an excellent means of engaging the public on air pollution issues. It has been a pleasure to support this project and will look forward to sharing this with the interested user groups.  Dr Stuart Cole, another co-author from Oxfordshire County Council, said:  We re proud to be collaborators on the HedgeDATE project. HedgeDATE will be a useful educational tool for councils, schools, other organisations and members of the public to consult when planning green areas for improved air quality.  Professor Stephen Holgate, UK Research and Innovation and Met Office Clean Air Champion, and Special Advisor to the Royal College of Physicians on Air Quality, said:  HedgeDATE is another excellent outcome of the work undertaken by Professor Kumar s team to communicate complex science via practical and accessible means. Like their earlier work on guidance for schools, this tool will help to improve and protect public health. There is an urgent need for a joined-up approach to communication, which is one of the next important tasks for us in our role as UKRI/Met Office Clean Air Champions.

Now, researchers at UC San Francisco have gained insight into how they may be doing this through the downstream activity of a powerful estrogen receptor. The discovery offers clues to overcoming resistance to therapies like tamoxifen that are used in many types of breast cancer.  Estrogen receptor   (ER ) drives more than 70 percent of breast cancers. The new research published Sept. 23, 2021, in Cell discovered that in addition to its well-known activity in the nucleus, it can also help malignant cells overcome innate anti-cancer mechanisms and develop resistance to treatment. In the nucleus, ER  regulates the conversion of DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA), a process known as transcription. Once formed, the mRNA strand travels from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it instructs ribosomes to make protein, a process known as translation. To their surprise, the researchers found that ER  plays a role in this process as well by binding to the newly formed mRNA. The RNA-centric function of the estrogen receptor has so far been hidden behind its well-established role as a transcription factor, which may have been supporting cancer progression on the sly,  said Yichen Xu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Urology at UCSF and the first author of the study.  Using breast cancer cell lines, the research team saw how ER  tends to bind to RNAs, particularly messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in cancer progression. Some of these mRNAs keep cells from committing suicide when they accumulate too many harmful mutations. Others help them proliferate under extremely difficult conditions, such as lack of oxygen or nutrients. Still others help them evade therapeutic interventions.   Cancer cells are constantly being exposed to stress, and these cells have learned to live with it,  said Davide Ruggero, PhD, the senior author of the study, a professor of Urology and the Helen Diller Family Endowed Chair in Basic Research at UCSF.  Many compounds used to kill cancer induce stress in the cancer, and most of the cancer cells die. But some eventually find a way to bypass the stress induced by the therapy.  Endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, block the transcription activity of ER  in a cancer cell s nucleus. Although they can be highly effective at first for most patients with ER -positive breast cancer, a significant number develop drug resistance.  To understand ER s role in this, Ruggero s team analyzed cancer cells from 14 patients diagnosed with ER -positive breast cancer and found they had elevated levels of ER  mRNA targets.  Then they experimented with breast cancer cell lines that had acquired resistance to tamoxifen, both in tissue culture and in mouse xenografts. Inhibiting the ER  RNA-binding activity restored tamoxifen s potency against the tumors in mice. It also made the cells in culture more sensitive to stress and apoptosis.  A better understanding of ER s many functions could help optimize current treatments   like tamoxifen   as well as lead to new therapeutic targets. Compounds that target translational control in cancer are already in the clinic and can now be tested for potency against breast cancers that are associated with ER  expression. Much more work needs to be done, however, to really understand how ER  controls RNA biology in the cytoplasm. And other regulators of RNA could yet be discovered.  One of the reasons why we haven t cured cancer is because we still don t fully understand how it works,  Ruggero said.  If we start from the most basic point of view, we might be able to discover new things. Reference: Xu Y, Huangyang P, Wang Y, et al.

It provides further evidence that long-standing concerns about nuts and weight gain   often found in popular media and clinical nutrition guidelines   are unwarranted, the researchers say.  Overall, we found there is no association between nuts and weight gain, and in fact some analyses showed higher nut intake associated with reductions in body weight and waist circumference,  said lead author Stephanie Nishi, who was a doctoral student in nutritional sciences in the Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the time of the study.  This study really hits home the idea that nuts can be a good option for people with diabetes or cardiovascular risk, but also for all individuals broadly as part of a healthy eating plan, without caveats.  The researchers pooled the results of 121 clinical trials and prospective studies, with over half a million participants in total. They then used a widely accepted system called GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to gage the quality of the studies.  We found the certainty of evidence was high for trials and moderate for observational studies,  said John Sievenpiper, principal investigator on the study and an associate professor of nutritional sciences and medicine at the Temerty Faculty of Medicine.  That s a good indication of no harm from nuts relative to weight gain   no more than any other foods   and there may indeed be a benefit of weight loss in addition to the other widely acknowledged health benefits of nuts.  Many nutrition and clinical guidelines for diabetes and heart disease recommend nuts as part of a healthy approach to eating. They include the Mediterranean, Portfolio, vegetarian or plant-based and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) dietary patterns. Yet, global consumption of nuts is far below those guidelines, and when people do meet the bar, it s often through peanuts. A typical serving of nuts is 28 to 42 grams (1 to 1.5 ounces), or what fits in the palm of an adult hand   and many guidelines suggest one serving per day.  We ve seen consumption of nuts increase in some areas over the last decade, especially middle- and high-income countries, but most people could better realize their benefits,  said Sievenpiper, adding he eats more than a handful most days.  Always good to practise what you preach,  he said. Sievenpiper said the study was a massive amount of work. It was led by Nishi during more than four years of her doctoral studies and encompassed many types of nuts, as well as people with various health conditions and statuses. In related work, Sievenpiper is running a clinical trial on heart health and the Portfolio diet, with nuts as a core pillar. Earlier this year, his lab found that a calorie labelled is not the same as a calorie digested and absorbed, when people consume almonds. Nishi is now studying nuts, cognitive performance and vascular health in the lab of Jordi Salas Salvad  at Spain s University of Rovira i Virgili.  I didn t used to eat many nuts, but now I m surrounded by almonds and macadamias   so eating more,  Nishi said.  Especially due to the evidence supporting their health benefits, but also because of their versatility in the kitchen and on the go. ReferenceNishi SK et al. Are fatty nuts a weighty concern?

This suggests that limiting neuroinflammation may represent a promising new approach to treat neurological diseases and neuropathic pain that are driven by neuroinflammation.In a preclinical study published in the journal Glia, Peter King, M.D., and Burt Nabors, M.D., show that their small molecule drug, SRI-42127, can potently attenuate the triggers of neuroinflammation. These experiments in glial cell cultures and mice now open the door to testing SRI-42127 in models of acute and chronic neurological injury.Glial cells are the non-neuronal cells of the central nervous system, or CNS, that help support and protect neurons. One of the types, microglia, are brain macrophages that respond to injury or infection.  Microglia and astroglia are key cells in the central nervous system that   when activated   drive neuroinflammation by secreting toxic inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines,  King and Nabors said.King and Nabors, both professors in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Neurology, have collaborated for 25 years to study the mechanisms that trigger neuroinflammation and the role of neuroinflammation in neurological injury, degenerative disease and cancer. They say this current study builds on their prior findings that microglia and astroglia cells rely on a key RNA-binding protein called HuR that protects the messenger RNAs encoding inflammatory mediators from degradation and promotes their translation into proteins.Neuroinflammation occurs when activated microglia and astrocytes in the brain or spinal column secrete cytokines and chemokines like IL1 , IL-6, TNF- , iNOS, CXCL1 and CCL2. The messenger RNAs for those pro-inflammatory signaling proteins contain adenine- and uridine-rich elements, or AREs, that govern their expression.King, Nabors and UAB colleagues have previously shown that HuR, an RNA regulator protein that binds to AREs, plays a major positive role in regulating the inflammatory cytokine production, making it a major control point in neuroinflammation.HuR normally concentrates in the nuclei of glial cells. However, when glial cells are activated, HuR translocates out of the nucleus and into the cell cytoplasm, where it can boost production of neuroinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.In previous work, the UAB researchers showed that HuR translocates out of the nucleus of astrocytes in the acute CNS diseases spinal column injury and stroke. They also showed that it translocates out of the nucleus in microglia in the chronic CNS disease ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Importantly, monomer HuR cannot pass through the nuclear envelope that acts as a regulatory membrane barrier between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Only HuR dimers   made up by the coupling of two single HuR molecules   are able to translocate from nucleus to cytoplasm. This knowledge permitted collaborative research by Southern Research, of Birmingham, Alabama, and UAB, using high-throughput screening, to identify the small molecule drug SRI-42127 that inhibits dimerization of HuR.In the current study, King, Nabors, Natalia Filippova, Ph.D., and UAB colleagues tested the biological relevance of SRI-42127, using lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, to activate glial cells to initiate the inflammatory cascade. The UAB researchers found that treatment with SRI-42127 suppressed HuR translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in LPS-activated glial cells, both in tissue culture and in mice. SRI-42127 also significantly attenuated the production of proinflammatory mediators, including the cytokines IL1 , IL-6, TNF-  and iNOS, and the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2.Furthermore, SRI-42127 suppressed microglial activation in mouse brains, and it attenuated the recruitment of immune-cell neutrophils and monocytes into the CNS from outside the blood-brain barrier. Such an entry of neutrophils and monocytes can exacerbate inflammation in the brain or spinal cord. In summary, SRI-42127 penetrated the blood-brain barrier and quickly suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Our findings,  King and Nabors said,  underscore HuR s critical role in promoting glial activation and the potential for SRI-42127 and other HuR inhibitors to treat neurological diseases driven by this activation. In unpublished work in collaboration with Robert Sorge, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Psychology, UAB College of Arts and Sciences, King and Nabors have found potential beneficial effects of SRI-42127 to reduce neuropathic pain, a condition that is triggered by microglial-induced neuroinflammation.  This would be a non-opioid approach to treating pain,  they said.Any future potential clinical treatments will require finesse. Therapeutic targeting of glia in CNS disease is a balancing act since these cells also exert neuroprotective and neuroplastic effects, depending on the phase of recovery from CNS injury or stage of neurodegenerative disease,  King and Nabors said.  In the initial phases after spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury or stroke, the pro-inflammatory activation of glia worsens secondary tissue injury and triggers pathways of chronic neuropathic pain, in contrast to the more chronic phases where glia become protective. In neurodegenerative processes like ALS and Alzheimer s, glia also play changing roles during the course of the disease. Reference: Chellappan R, Guha A, Si Y, et al.

Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey dated these tracks using radiocarbon dating of seed layers above and below the footprint horizons. The dates range in age and confirm human presence over at least two millennia with the oldest tracks dating from around 23,000 years ago, which corresponds to the height of the last glacial cycle   making them the oldest known human footprints in the Americas. Footprints found at White Sands National Park in New Mexico, providing the earliest evidence of human activity in the Americas. The research, published in Science on Sept. 23, was conducted by scientists from Cornell, Bournemouth University, the National Park Service, U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Arizona. The tracks at White Sands were first discovered by David Bustos, resources manager at the park. In order to investigate the site, the team pioneered non-invasive geophysical techniques led by Thomas Urban, research scientist in the College of Arts and Sciences and with the Cornell Tree Ring Laboratory""  Detection and imaging with nondestructive technology has greatly expanded our capacity to study these remarkable footprints in their broader context,  Urban said.  Now we have a unique window into life during the Pleistocene in North America, and this new study provides the first unequivocal evidence of a sustained human presence in the Americas thousands of years earlier than most archaeologists thought was likely.  The footprints tell an interesting tale of what life was like at this time, say the researchers. Judging by their size, the tracks were left mainly by teenagers and younger children, with the occasional adult. Animal tracks   mammoth, giant ground sloth, dire wolves and birds   are present as well.  It is an important site because of all of the trackways we ve found there show an interaction of humans in the landscape alongside extinct animals,  said co-author Sally Reynolds of Bournemouth University.  We can see the coexistence between humans and animals on the site as a whole, and by being able to accurately date these footprints, we re building a greater picture of the landscape.  Traditional archaeology relies on the discovery of bones and tools but can often be difficult to interpret. Human footprints provide unequivocal evidence of presence and also of behavior. It was previously thought that humans entered America closer to 16,000 years ago, after the melting of the North American ice sheets, which opened up migration routes. However, the footprints show a much earlier migration of humans into the Americas.  The footprints left at White Sands give a picture of what was taking place, teenagers interacting with younger children and adults,  said Matthew Bennett, Bournemouth University, who helped lead the study.  We can think of our ancestors as quite functional, hunting and surviving, but what we see here is also activity of play, and of different ages coming together. A true insight into these early people.

The researchers analyzed 362 industry-sponsored Phase III randomized trials in oncology from 2008 to 2017, and found that 87% were either false-positive or true-negative for meeting overall survival goals. More than half of the initially reported positive trials were found to be false-positive (58.4%) for overall survival, while the overwhelming majority of negative results were determined to be true-negative (with only 0.9% false-negative).Dr. Shen continued:  Our study shows that reducing false positive errors by imposing more stringent statistical threshold in Phase III trials is not likely to be practically feasible. A better strategy is to rethink the process that leads to the decision of moving a new therapy to Phase III testing to begin with. More research is needed in this regard. Our study highlights the need to more efficiently identify which new therapies merit Phase III testing,  said lead researcher Changyu Shen, PhD, Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School at the time this study was conducted.  In order to sustain the rate of innovation in cancer therapeutics and ensure that our patients have access to effective yet affordable therapies, the clinical trial pipeline in oncology must be efficient and accurate. Our work shows that in the past ten years, this has not been the case. Most of the trials in this novel study focused on lung, breast, gastrointestinal, and hematologic cancers; trials with fewer than 100 participants were excluded, meaning rare cancer types were less likely to be included. The Phase III trials were predominately two-arm studies of an interventional regimen compared with a control treatment. This paper shows that a lot of drugs with  positive  Phase III trials may have a smaller ultimate benefit than was expected, and that changing the threshold for statistical significance is not a quick fix,  said Elizabeth A. Handorf, PhD, Associate Research Professor, Fox Chase Cancer Center, who was not involved in this research.  I think it highlights the need for more efficient study designs, like adaptive trials, and clear definitions of what makes an effect clinically meaningful.

Amyloid PET scans already are used widely in Alzheimer s research, and this algorithm represents a new way of analyzing such scans to approximate when symptoms will arise. Using a person s age and data from a single amyloid PET scan, the algorithm yields an estimate of how far a person has progressed toward dementia   and how much time is left before cognitive impairment sets in. I perform amyloid PET scans for research studies, and when I tell cognitively normal individuals about positive results, the first question is always,  How long do I have until I get dementia? ,  said senior author Suzanne Schindler, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology.  Until now, the answer I d have to give was something like,  You have an increased risk of developing dementia in the next five years.  But what does that mean? Individuals want to know when they are likely to develop symptoms, not just whether they are at higher risk. Schindler and colleagues analyzed amyloid PET scans from 236 people participating in Alzheimer s research studies through Washington University s Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. The participants were an average of 67 years old at the beginning of the study. All participants underwent at least two brain scans an average of 4  years apart. The researchers applied a widely used metric known as the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) to the scans to estimate the amount of amyloid in each participant s brain at each time point.The researchers also accessed over 1,300 clinical assessments on 180 of the participants. The assessments typically were performed every one to three years. Most participants were cognitively normal at the start of data collection, so the repeated assessments allowed the researchers to pinpoint when each participant s cognitive skills began to slip.Schindler spent years trying to figure out how to use the data in amyloid PET scans to estimate the age at which symptoms would appear. The breakthrough came when she realized that amyloid accumulation has a tipping point and that each individual hits that tipping point at a different age. After this tipping point, amyloid accumulation follows a reliable trajectory. You may hit the tipping point when you re 50; it may happen when you re 80; it may never happen,  Schindler said.  But once you pass the tipping point, you re going to accumulate high levels of amyloid that are likely to cause dementia. If we know how much amyloid someone has right now, we can calculate how long ago they hit the tipping point and estimate how much longer it will be until they are likely to develop symptoms. People in the study who reached the tipping point at younger ages took longer to develop cognitive symptoms than those who reached it later in life. Participants who hit the tipping point at age 50 typically took nearly 20 years to develop symptoms; those who hit it at age 80 took less than 10 years. When we look at the brains of relatively young people who have died with Alzheimer s, they typically look pretty healthy, other than Alzheimer s,  Schindler said.  But older people more frequently have damage to the brain from other causes, so their cognitive reserves are lower, and it takes less amyloid to cause impairment. The power of this new technique is that it requires just one brain scan, plus the person s age. With that data, the model can estimate the time to symptom onset, plus or minus several years. In this study, the correlation between the expected age of symptom onset and the true age at diagnosis was better than 0.9 on a scale of 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation).After age, the genetic variant APOE4 is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer s dementia. People who carry one copy of the variant are two to three times more likely to develop Alzheimer s dementia than the general population, and people who carry two copies are 10 times more likely. In this study, people with the high-risk variant hit the tipping point younger, but once that point was passed, they followed the same trajectory as everyone else. APOE4 seems to have a seeding effect,  Schindler said.  At very low levels, below the tipping point, you see amyloid rising in people with APOE4 while it s not changing in people without APOE4. That means APOE4 carriers are going to hit the tipping point sooner. People with two copies of APOE4 hit the tipping point about 10 years earlier than people with no copies. But after that point, we see no difference between the APOE4 carriers and noncarriers. At an out-of-pocket cost of about $6,000, amyloid PET brain scans are too expensive for routine clinical use. However, this algorithm could help accelerate the pace of drug development by streamlining clinical trials. Most participants in clinical trials designed to prevent or slow Alzheimer s symptoms do not develop symptoms during the trials,  Schindler said.  That s a lot of time and effort   for the participants as well as the researchers   that doesn t yield useful data. If we could do trials only on people who are likely to develop symptoms in the next few years, that would make the process of finding therapies much more efficient.

For example, the tissue of aging human brains sometimes develops abnormal clumps of proteins that are the hallmark of Alzheimer s disease. How can you protect your brain from these effects?Researchers at Rush University Medical Center have found that older adults may benefit from a specific diet called the MIND diet even when they develop these protein deposits, known as amyloid plaques and tangles. Plaques and tangles are a pathology found in the brain that build up in between nerve cells and typically interfere with thinking and problem-solving skills.Developed by the late Martha Clare Morris, ScD, who was a Rush nutritional epidemiologist, and her colleagues, the MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets. Previous research studies have found that the MIND diet may reduce a person s risk of developing Alzheimer s disease dementia.Now a study has shown that participants in the study who followed the MIND diet moderately later in life did not have cognition problems, according to a paper published on Sept. 14 in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease. Some people have enough plaques and tangles in their brains to have a postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease, but they do not develop clinical dementia in their lifetime,  said Klodian Dhana, MD, PhD, lead author of the paper and an assistant professor in the Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine at Rush Medical College . Some have the ability to maintain cognitive function despite the accumulation of these pathologies in the brain, and our study suggests that the MIND diet is associated with better cognitive functions independently of brain pathologies related to Alzheimer s disease.In this study, the researchers examined the associations of diet from the start of the study until death brain pathologies and cognitive functioning in older adults who participated in the Rush Alzheimer s Disease Center s ongoing Memory and Aging Project, which began in 1997 and includes people living in greater Chicago. The participants were mostly white without known dementia, and all of them agreed to undergo annual clinical evaluations while alive and brain autopsy after their death.The researchers followed 569 participants, who were asked to complete annual evaluations and cognitive tests to see if they had developed memory and thinking problems. Beginning in 2004, participants were given an annual food frequency questionnaire about how often they ate 144 food items in previous year.Using the questionnaire answers, the researchers gave each participant a MIND diet score based on how often the participants ate specific foods. The MIND diet has 15 dietary components, including 10  brain-healthy food groups  and five unhealthy groups   red meat, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried or fast food.To adhere to and benefit from the MIND diet, a person would need to eat at least three servings of whole grains, a green leafy vegetable and one other vegetable every day   along with a glass of wine   snack most days on nuts, have beans every other day or so, eat poultry and berries at least twice a week and fish at least once a week. A person also must limit intake of the designated unhealthy foods, limiting butter to less than 1 1/2 teaspoons a day and eating less than a serving a week of sweets and pastries, whole fat cheese, and fried or fast food.Based on the frequency of intake reported for the healthy and unhealthy food groups, the researchers calculated the MIND diet score for each participant across the study period. An average of the MIND diet score from the start of the study until the participant s death was used in the analysis to limit measurement error. Seven sensitivity measures were calculated to confirm accuracy of the findings. We found that a higher MIND diet score was associated with better memory and thinking skills independently of Alzheimer's disease pathology and other common age-related brain pathologies. The diet seemed to have a protective capacity and may contribute to cognitive resilience in the elderly.  Dhana said. Diet changes can impact cognitive functioning and risk of dementia, for better or worse,  he continued.  There are fairly simple diet and lifestyle changes a person could make that may help to slow cognitive decline with aging, and contribute to brain health.

But until recently, AI has been narrowly focused on emulating human logic. Now, researchers are looking to mimic human cognition in devices that can learn, remember and make decisions the way a human brain does.Emulating such features in the solid state could inspire new algorithms in AI and neuromorphic computing that would have the flexibility to address uncertainties, contradictions and other aspects of everyday life. Neuromorphic computing mimics the neural structure and operation of the human brain, in part, by building artificial nerve systems to transfer electrical signals that mimic brain signals.Researchers from Rutgers, Purdue and other institutions studied how the electrical conductivity of nickel oxide, a special type of insulating material, responded when its environment was changed repeatedly over various time intervals. The goal was to find a material whose electrical conductivity can be tuned by modulating the concentration of atomic defects with external stimuli such as oxygen, ozone and light,  said Subhasish Mandal, a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers-New Brunswick.  We studied how this material behaves when we dope the system with oxygen or hydrogen, and most importantly, how the external stimulation changes the material's electronic properties. The researchers found that when the gas stimulus changed rapidly, the material couldn t respond in full. It stayed in an unstable state in either environment and its response began to decrease. When the researchers introduced a noxious stimulus such as ozone, the material began to respond more strongly only to decrease again. The most interesting part of our results is that it demonstrates universal learning characteristics such as habituation and sensitization that we generally find in living species,  Mandal said.  These material characteristics in turn can inspire new algorithms for artificial intelligence. Much as collective motion of birds or fish have inspired AI, we believe collective behavior of electrons in a quantum solid can do the same in the future. The growing field of AI requires hardware that can host adaptive memory properties beyond what is used in today s computers,  he added.  We find that nickel oxide insulators, which historically have been restricted to academic pursuits, might be interesting candidates to be tested in future for brain-inspired computers and robotics.

Has an old song ever brought back memories of a first date? The ability to remember relationships between unrelated items (an odor and a location, a song and an event) is known as associative memory.Psychologists began studying associative memory in the 1800s, with William James describing the phenomenon in his 1890 classic The Principles of Psychology. Scientists today agree that the structures responsible for the formation of associative memory are found in the medial temporal lobe, or the famous  memory center  of the brain, but the particular cells involved, and how those cells are controlled, have remained a mystery until now.Neuroscientists at the University of California, Irvine have discovered specific types of neurons within the memory center of the brain that are responsible for acquiring new associative memories. Additionally, they have discovered how these associative memory neurons are controlled. We rely on associative memories in our everyday lives and this research is an important step in understanding the detailed mechanism of how these types of memories are formed in the brain. Although associative memory is one of the most basic forms of memory in our everyday life, mechanisms underlying associative memory remain unclear  said lead researcher Kei Igarashi, faculty fellow of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and assistant professor of anatomy & neurobiology at the UCI School of Medicine.The study published today in the journal Nature, reports for the first time, that specific cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the medial temporal lobe, called fan cells, are required for the acquisition of new associative memories and that these cells are controlled by dopamine, a brain chemical known to be involved in our experience of pleasure or reward.In the study, researchers used electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics to record and control activity from fan cells in mice as they learn to associate specific odors with rewards. This approach led researchers to discover that fan cells compute and represent the association of the two new unrelated items (odor and reward). These fan cells are required for successful acquisition of new associative memories. Without these cells, pre-learned associations can be retrieved, but the new associations cannot be acquired. Additionally acquiring new associations also requires dopamine. We never expected that dopamine is involved in the memory circuit. However, when the evidence accumulated, it gradually became clear that dopamine is involved,  said Igarashi.  These experiments were like a detective story for us, and we are excited about the results. This discovery is an important piece in the puzzle of understanding how memories are formed in the brain and lays a foundation on which other researchers can continue to build. Associative memory abilities are known to decline in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer s Disease. Understanding the neurobiological mechanism of how these memories are formed is the first step to developing therapeutics to slow the loss of associative memory abilities in Alzheimer s Disease.Reference: Lee JY, Jun H, Soma S, et al.

Neighborhoods matter. They are important spaces for older adults, and they really impact opportunities or barriers to age well in place,  said Jessica Finlay, lead author on the studies and a research fellow at the U-M Institute for Social Research Survey Research Center. These papers think through how neighborhoods might encourage healthy behaviors that could in turn benefit the brain, and for Alzheimer s and dementia risks, which are among the greatest fears and greatest burdens that our aging population faces. Finlay and colleagues found older adults whose neighborhoods are conducive to physical activity and socialization were about three years younger, in terms of cognitive health, than those who had very little access to exercise and socialization. Those who had access to intellectually stimulating places such as museums, higher education campuses and libraries had about a five-year difference in cognitive age compared to those who had little to no access to such places.However, the study examining intellectually stimulating places shows a larger protective benefit for white adults than for Black older adults. The researchers think this likely reflects the impact of broad, structural systems of racism that constrain and distort Black populations  access to such spaces. This isn t a one-size-fits-all finding. We do see that access to these neighborhood sites diverges along different axes of power and privilege, including race, gender and socioeconomic status,  said Michael Esposito.Esposito, an assistant professor of sociology at Washington University, led the studies  quantitative analysis. Each of the studies used a mixed method analysis, which compared interviews and analysis of a small group of older adults in an urban area to a survey of a much larger, nationally representative group of older adults.In the first assessment, Finlay interviewed 125 older adults in the Minneapolis metropolitan area to learn about how those older adults lived in their communities. In each of the studies, Finlay s team identified a connection between older adults  cognitive health and proximity to places where they could socialize, exercise and visit intellectually stimulating places.One participant told Finlay about what she finds valuable about her exercise center. They built a YMCA for us 50-plus,  said the participant in an interview.  The people there, we re all older. It s just like a big social club. We work out, but we also laugh and have fun. It s just a bunch of old people getting together and hanging out. I always felt that laughter is very healthy for you. I feel rejuvenated going there, both mentally and spiritually. It s just like a safe haven to go to, plus we get healthy. Esposito tested Finlay s observations against a much larger group, using results from an ongoing study of just over 30,000 people, called the REGARDS study. The REGARDS study recruited participants with an average age of 64 between 2003 and 2007. In 2006, the participants  cognitive health was first assessed, with a follow-up every two years after. Jessica s qualitative work gave us clues about where people might have these interactions they need to promote their cognitive health, and we used that as a starting point to build out quantitative models, to see if these observations held,  Esposito said.  Using the REGARDS data, we could figure out what environmental conditions people with higher cognitive function scores experienced and what external conditions people who displayed lower cognitive function scores had in common. The researchers found that places of socialization that were more positively associated with protecting cognitive health were senior centers and organizations such as Veterans of Foreign Wars or racial or ethnic organizations. Living in neighborhoods with high densities of parks, fitness and sports recreation centers, and walkable destinations were associated with better cognitive health.In the study examining intellectually stimulating centers, the researchers found that museums and other cultural sites provided the best cognitive health benefit but again, the effect was larger for white people. Moving forward, we re looking at differences by person and by place so for example, differences in protective cognitive benefits by men or women or nonbinary adults, by education levels and by race,  said Finlay, who is also a postdoctoral fellow at the U-M School of Public Health s Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health. Understanding these differences might help inform community-level interventions that are more targeted to those who are most at risk, which include marginalized and underserved communities, who have higher rates of dementia and Alzheimer s risk. Senior study author Philippa Clarke said understanding the neighborhood environments that can support cognitive health is essential for mitigating the future burden of dementia in America s aging population. Additionally, as COVID-19 has changed the day-to-day lives of aging Americans, it is critical to understand which neighborhood environments can buffer the impact of the pandemic on cognitive decline,  said Clarke, professor of epidemiology at the U-M School of Public Health and research professor at ISR s Survey Research Center.References: This article has been republished from the following materials.

This is shown by a joint study of the University of Bonn, the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the Institut Fran ois Jacob in France. However, in certain mutations that can cause Parkinson's disease, this cooperation is impaired. The findings are published in the renowned journal Cell.The protein alpha-synuclein (abbreviated aSyn) performs important tasks in the nerve cells of the brain. But under certain circumstances, aSyn molecules can clump together and form insoluble aggregates. These damage the neurons; they are for instance typically found in the brains of people suffering from Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia.The immune cells of the brain, the microglial cells, therefore try to break down and dispose of the aSyn aggregates. This process is not only time-consuming; it can also cause the microglial cells themselves to perish. ""We have now identified a mechanism that addresses both problems,"" explains Prof. Dr. Michael Heneka.

A major finding of the study was that genetic regulations were found in close proximity to the gene in 88 per cent of all the genes analysed. These are called cis effects.

Yet, it is solicited everywhere, all the time, and even more so in recent years with the widespread daily use of electronic devices that emit vibrations. Indeed, any moving object transmits oscillatory signals that propagate through solid substrates. Our body detects them by means of mechanoreceptors located below the skin and transmits the information to the brain similarly to auditory, olfactory or visual stimuli. By studying how mice and humans perceive tactile vibrations, Swiss researchers from the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Fribourg (UNIFR) discovered that the brain does not reliably perceive the frequency of a vibration when its amplitude varies. An illusory phenomenon is thereby created, which highlights how far our perception of the world around us can deviate from its physical reality. The results can be discovered in the journal Nature Communications.   Vibrations are small oscillatory movements emitted from a point of equilibrium. By propagating as waves through solid materials, they can be perceived by most living organisms. Vibrations are defined by two principle features: frequency, which signals the rate of change in Hz (i.e. the number of repetitions per second) and amplitude, which corresponds to the maximal size the wave can reach, in other words its intensity.  When for instance our phone vibrates, the vibration can vary more or less rapidly   its frequency   and more or less strongly   its amplitude , explains Daniel Huber, professor in the Department of Basic Neuroscience at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, who directed the study.  How does our brain interpret these physical characteristics? This is the question we aimed to answer in our study . This article has been republished from the following materials.

Published in the scientific journal iScience, the series of experiments led by Yoichi Shinkai showed that postnatal treatment resulted in improved symptoms, both in the brain and in behavior.Normally, we get two good copies of most genes, one from each parent. In Kleefstra syndrome, one copy of the EHMT1 gene is mutated or missing. This leads to half the normal amount of GLP, a protein whose job is to control genes related to brain development through a process called H3K9 methylation. Without enough GLP, H3K9 methylation is also reduced, and the connections between neurons in the brain do not develop normally. The result is intellectual disability and autistic-like symptoms.  We still don t know if Kleefstra syndrome is a curable disease after birth or how this epigenetic dysregulation leads to the neurological disorder,  says Shinkai.  Our studies in mice have provided new information about what causes the behavioral abnormalities associated with the syndrome and have shown that a cure is a real possibility in the future. Reasoning that extra GLP might be an effective treatment, the researchers performed a series of experiments in mice that were engineered to have only one good copy of the EHMT1 gene. The brains of these mice show characteristics of the human condition, including 40% less GLP and 30% less H3K9 methylation. The mice also display several behaviors seen in humans with Kleefstra syndrome, such as reduced locomotion and greater anxiety. After each experiment, the researchers measured these factors and compared them to normal mice to see if the treatment had been effective.The researchers artificially induced GLP production after birth in two experiments, once throughout the whole brain and once specific to adult neurons in the brain. Treatment in 3- to 4-week-old juvenile mice quickly rescued GLP and H3K9 methylation levels in the brain in both tests. Behavior improved several weeks later, but only when GLP was increased throughout the whole brain. Thus, brain and behavioral symptoms were successfully rescued by treatment that increased GLP levels throughout the brain after mice had already become juveniles.The researchers next wanted to know why their treatment only fully worked when GLP was increased throughout the brain, not just in neurons. Thinking that perhaps the disorder abnormally activates microglia cells in the brain, which are known to control immune responses such as inflammation, the team searched and found a well-known inflammatory response in the brains of the model mice, along with greater amounts of activated microglial cells. Knocking out a key protein involved in the inflammatory response reversed some of the brain abnormalities caused by inflammation but did not change the behavior.  This means that brain inflammation is only part of the story,  explains first author Ayumi Yamada.  To have a complete understanding of the disease, we need to find out what happens in other non-neural cells when we increase GLP. As this is the first report of neuro-inflammation in Kleefstra syndrome, the next step is to find out if it also occurs in the human condition. Shinkai believes the chances are high and says he would not be surprised if other neurological diseases caused by epigenetic dysregulation were also related to abnormal inflammation in the brain.  Although we don t yet know if our findings will be applicable to patients with Kleefstra syndrome,  he says,  we have shown that a cure after birth is possible and believe this will bring hope to patients and their families.

With the renewable proportions of petroleum-derived fuels set to increase from 5 per cent to 20 per cent by 2030, fuel additives sourced this way could help address net-zero carbon emission targets. Malcolm Joyce, Professor of Nuclear Engineering at Lancaster University, said:  Co-generation with nuclear energy is an important area of current research, for example, using heat alongside the production of electricity.  We set out to determine whether radiation might also present a similar possibility, and discovered that it can: in this case yielding a low-carbon fuel additive. Dr Vesna Najdanovic, an expert in biofuels from Aston University, and previously at Lancaster University, said:  I am so excited about our work as it reveals a new method for processing wastes from biodiesel industry using spent nuclear energy. This green technology will pave the pathway to use waste as a resource to produce valuable chemicals and biofuels. Reliable, low-carbon energy from nuclear or biofuels is integral to many strategies to reduce carbon emissions, however nuclear plants have high upfront costs and the manufacture of biodiesel produces waste glycerol, which has few secondary uses.Combining technologies to create raw materials from waste glycerol using ionising radiation could diversify nuclear energy use, and also make a valuable use of biodiesel waste.  Researchers have discovered that leftover energy from spent nuclear fuel can be harnessed to produce a short-lived, radiation-induced catalyst. This catalyst facilitates a reaction that produces both solketal and acetol. This process forgoes the requirement for costly and energy-intensive steps such as pH changes, high temperatures, high pressures or additional catalytic reagents with negligible ongoing radiation-processing costs once fully set up.Solketal is an emerging fuel additive that increases fuel octane numbers and reduces gum formation, consequently preventing irregular fuel combustion (knocking) and engine efficiency losses while also lowering particulate emissions. Meanwhile, acetol can be used in the production of other useful chemicals such as propylene glycol and furan derivatives, or as a dyeing agent for textile manufacturing.Considering the scalability of this process to existing nuclear facilities within Europe (i.e. spent fuel pools or contemporary Pressurized Water Reactors), researchers have hypothesised that 104 tonnes per year of solketal could be generated by nuclear co-production. This would equate to significant quantities of usable fuel blend per year.An increase of 5 per cent to 20 per cent v/v in the renewable proportion of commercial petroleum blends is forecast by 2030, and it was announced recently that E10 petrol will be adopted as the standard grade in the UK.  Nuclear-driven, biomass-derived solketal could contribute in this context towards net-zero emissions targets, combining low-carbon co-generation and co-production.Reference: Plant AG, Kos B, Jazbec A, Snoj L, Najdanovic-Visak V, Joyce MJ.

The ability to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes could lead to earlier detection and more targeted therapies for the disease.Only about 8% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma survive, in part because their disease was not detected early, when surgery or chemotherapy might have been more effective. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma currently relies on a single biomarker, which may not be relevant to all subtypes, meaning that many cases could be missed. We have been thinking about all liver cancers as being the same and using the same diagnostic tool for everyone,  explained Anand Mehta, Ph.D., senior author on the article and professor in the MUSC Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.  And that s a huge limitation in early diagnosis. It s the biggest hurdle right now. Diagnostic tools that are better able to distinguish between hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes would aid in earlier detection and could lead to more personalized therapies. This approach is already being used for breast and other cancers, and Mehta thinks it could work for liver cancer as well.In the current study, he and his team, which had previously studied sugar structures in hepatocellular carcinoma tumors, tried to find a way to correlate specific sugar structures to specific hepatocellular carcinoma tumor subtypes.Around 60% of proteins in the human body contain sugars. These specific sugars, N-glycans, change in a cancerous environment. For example, imagine you are deciding which outfit to wear based on the temperature outside. In normal tissue, the proteins are  decorated  with specific sugars, e.g., a thick coat for winter weather. In a tumor, regardless of the environment, the proteins are decorated with sugars at random, e.g., a thick coat and a beanie for summer weather. Mehta and his lab used these specific  outfits  to distinguish the three genetic subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma. This is the first piece of evidence to show that the genetic subtypes of cancers affect the sugar profile you will see,  said Andrew DelaCourt, a doctoral candidate in the Mehta laboratory and lead author on the article.DelaCourt thought it particularly interesting that the biomarker currently used to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma is able to detect only one of the two aggressive subtypes that the team studied, lessening the likelihood that the disease would be detected early in people with that subtype. The researchers found that a particular sugar, fucose, is associated with the other aggressive subtype and could be used as an early-detection biomarker.For this study, Mehta and DelaCourt identified sugars on hepatocellular carcinoma tumors, using a technique pioneered at MUSC that relies on the advanced imaging technology MALDI-IMS, which works by determining the mass of the sugars that are cleaved from a tissue sample. With that information, Mehta s laboratory was able to identify which sugars correlated with which subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma tumor.Moving forward, the team wishes to expand this research by investigating whether they can identify hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes using patient blood samples. A blood-based diagnostic would have several clinical advantages. It would be much less invasive, as it would not require patients to undergo a tumor biopsy. It could also be more easily interpreted, as sugar levels in blood can be assessed with widely available techniques. The goal is to analyze the similarity between the sugars  changes in the blood and the tumor tissues,  said Mehta.  This is the next step toward clinical relevance.

However, many who live in resource-limited countries haven t been able to get vaccines, partly because these areas lack temperature-controlled shipping and storage facilities. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Nano have developed a microneedle patch that delivers a COVID-19 DNA vaccine into the skin, causing strong immune responses in cells and mice. Importantly, the patch can be stored for over 30 days at room temperature.To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three vaccines for use during the COVID-19 pandemic: one based on protein, and two on RNA. All of them must be kept refrigerated or frozen, which limits their distribution to remote or resource-limited areas. In addition, the vaccines must be administered by a healthcare worker as an injection into a muscle. Because immune cells aren t typically found in muscles, scientists have investigated various ways to deliver vaccines into the skin, which contains abundant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and could therefore generate a stronger immune response. Hui Li, Guangjun Nie, Hai Wang and colleagues wanted to develop a microneedle patch that efficiently delivers a COVID-19 vaccine under the skin, causing potent and durable immunity without the need for a cold chain or painful injections.  The researchers based their vaccine on DNA, which is easier to make than RNA or protein. It s also more stable than RNA. However, in clinical trials, intramuscular DNA vaccines have been limited in their effectiveness because, unlike RNA or protein, the DNA must find its way inside the cell nucleus to work. By delivering the vaccine into APC-rich skin rather than muscle, the researchers reasoned that they could increase the chances that the DNA would enter the nucleus of an APC.To make their delivery system, the team attached DNA sequences encoding either the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or nucleocapsid protein to the surface of non-toxic nanoparticles. Inside the nanoparticles was an adjuvant   a molecule that helps stimulate an immune response. Then, the researchers coated a microneedle patch with the vaccine nanoparticles. The small rectangular patch contained 100 biodegradable microneedles, each less than 1/10 the diameter of a bee s stinger, that could painlessly penetrate the skin s outer layer. The researchers tested the system in mice, showing that the spike-protein-encoding microneedle patch caused strong antibody and T-cell responses, with no observable side effects. Because the vaccine patches can be stored at room temperature for at least 30 days without losing efficacy, they could be an important tool for developing COVID-19 vaccines with global accessibility, the researchers say.Reference: Yin Y, Su W, Zhang J, et al.

Newly minted Ph.D. Sophie Coulson and her colleagues explained in a recent paper in Geophysical Research Letters that, as glacial ice from Greenland, Antarctica, and the Arctic Islands melts, Earth s crust beneath these land masses warps, an impact that can be measured hundreds and perhaps thousands of miles away. Scientists have done a lot of work directly beneath ice sheets and glaciers,  said Coulson, who did her work in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and received her doctorate in May from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.  So they knew that it would define the region where the glaciers are, but they hadn t realized that it was global in scale.  By analyzing satellite data on melt from 2003 to 2018 and studying changes in Earth s crust, Coulson and her colleagues were able to measure the shifting of the crust horizontally. Their research, which was highlighted in Nature, found that in some places the crust was moving more horizontally than it was lifting.  In addition to the surprising extent of its reach, the Nature brief pointed out, this research provides a potentially new way to monitor modern ice mass changes. To understand how the ice melt affects what is beneath it, Coulson suggested imagining the system on a small scale:  Think of a wooden board floating on top of a tub of water. When you push the board down, you would have the water beneath moving down. If you pick it up, you ll see the water moving vertically to fill that space.  These movements have an impact on the continued melting.  In some parts of Antarctica, for example, the rebounding of the crust is changing the slope of the bedrock under the ice sheet, and that can affect the ice dynamics,  said Coulson, who worked in the lab of Jerry Mitrovica, the Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science. The current melting is only the most recent movement researchers are observing.  The Arctic is an interesting region because, as well as the modern-day ice sheets, we also have a lasting signal from the last ice age,  Coulson explained. An ice sheet once covered what is now Northern Europe and Scandinavia during the Pleistocene Epoch, the ice age that started about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until roughly 11,000 years ago.  The Earth is actually still rebounding from that ice melting.   On recent timescales, we think of the Earth as an elastic structure, like a rubber band, whereas on timescales of thousands of years, the Earth acts more like a very slow-moving fluid.  said Coulson, explaining how these newer repercussions come to be overlaid on the older reverberations.  Ice age processes take a really, really long time to play out, and therefore we can still see the results of them today.  The implications of this movement are far-reaching.  Understanding all of the factors that cause movement of the crust is really important for a wide range of Earth science problems. For example, to accurately observe tectonic motions and earthquake activity, we need to be able to separate out this motion generated by modern-day ice-mass loss,  she said. Coulson is continuing her research as a Director s Postdoctoral Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico as part of a climate group that works on future projections of ice sheets and ocean dynamics. Glenn Antony Milne, professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Ottawa, explained that understanding the extent of this movement clarifies all studies of the planet s crust.  Sophie s work is important because it is the first to show that recent mass loss of ice sheets and glaciers causes 3D motion of the Earth s [solid] surface that is greater in magnitude and spatial extent than previously identified,  he said.  Also, one could look for this signal in regional and larger-scale global navigation satellite system datasets to, in principle, produce improved constraints on the distribution of ice mass fluctuations and/or solid Earth structure.

Whether this protection could pass from mothers to their infants before birth had remained a question.Published online September 22 in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology Maternal Fetal Medicine, the new study of 36 newborns whose mothers received either the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy found that 100 percent of the infants had protective antibodies at birth.Antibodies can either be produced as part of the natural response to infection or triggered by vaccines. With that in mind, the research team was able to tell apart antibodies in the neonatal blood that were created in response to natural infection from those made in response to the vaccines. The result is relevant because natural antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are not sufficiently protective for many people. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that just 23 percent of pregnant women have been vaccinated, despite growing evidence of prenatal vaccine safety.Led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the study authors observed the highest levels of antibodies in cord blood of mothers who were fully vaccinated during the second half of their pregnancies. This insight provides evidence of transferred immunity to neonates, which correlates to protection against infection for infants during the first months of life. Studies continue to reinforce the importance of vaccines during pregnancy and their power to protect two lives at once by preventing severe illness in both mothers and babies,  says Ashley S. Roman, MD, director of the Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine and the Silverman Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at NYU Langone Health, and one of the study s principal investigators.  If babies could be born with antibodies, it could protect them in the first several months of their lives, when they are most vulnerable. As the COVID-19 vaccines received authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the CDC consistently asserted that they should not be withheld from people who are pregnant and want the vaccine. Dr. Roman and colleagues confirm the strong evidence that the mRNA vaccines are safe during pregnancy in a study published August 16 in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology Maternal Fetal Medicine, titled  COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy: Early Experience from a Single Institution.  The study found no increased risks during pregnancy, birth complications, or identifiable risks to the fetus among those who received the vaccine.In the current study, though the sample size is small,  it is encouraging that neonatal antibody levels are high if women are vaccinated,  says Jennifer L. Lighter, MD, associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics, hospital epidemiologist at Hassenfeld Children s Hospital at NYU Langone, and the study s senior author.Existing studies analyze antibodies to the spike protein (anti-S IgG) alone, which may be present after natural infection or vaccination, and do not include antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein (anti-N IgG), which is only present following natural infection. Among the 36 samples collected, all had high levels of anti-S IgG. Of those samples, 31 were tested for anti-N IgG and were negative. High levels of transplacental antibody transfer are not surprising. It is consistent with what we see with other immunizations. Our findings add to a growing list of important reasons why women should be advised to receive the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy for the added benefit of their newborn receiving crucial protection,  adds Dr. Lighter.Reference: Trostle M, Aguero-Rosenfeld ME, Roman AS, et al.

It compared a variety of synthetic ropes commonly used in the maritime industry   but differing in age, wear surface and material   to assess the quantity and characterises of microplastics produced while they were in use. This was achieved by simulating, in both laboratory and field experiments, the rope hauling activity which is typically performed on board maritime vessels such as fishing boats. The results show that new and one-year old ropes can release around 20 microplastic fragments into the ocean for every metre hauled. However, as the rope gets older it can release significantly more fragments   two-year-old ropes shed on average around 720 fragments per metre, while 10-year-old rope releases more than 760 fragments per metre. Writing in Science of the Total Environment, researchers say that in fishing activities the rope length deployed during each haul could be up to 220m depending on the type of vessel and the depth of the ocean. However, based on a modest 50m of rope being hauled from a boat, they estimate that each time new rope is hauled it could release between 700 and 2000 microplastic pieces. Used rope could release anywhere up to 40,000 fragments. With more than 4,500 active fishing vessels in the UK, their estimates suggest this could result in anything between 326 million to 17 billion microplastic pieces entering the ocean annually from the UK fleet alone. Research Fellow Dr Imogen Napper, who led the study, said:  These estimates were calculated after hauling a 2.5kg weight. However, most maritime activities would be hauling much heavier loads, creating more friction and potentially more fragments. It highlights the pressing need for standards on rope maintenance, replacement and recycling in the maritime industry. However, it also shows the importance of continued innovation in synthetic rope design with the specific aim to reduce microplastic emissions.  The University of Plymouth was the first to highlight the global problem of marine microplastics, earning the Queen s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in 2019. Previous research, in conjunction with the Fishing for Litter initiative, has shown that commercial fishers are acutely aware of the potential for marine litter to cause lasting damage to their catches and the wider industry. The University is also part of an ongoing project working to develop biodegradable fishing gear that can be used by both small and large boats across the industry. This study was funded by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) as part of a wider project examining the impact of tyres and textiles on the marine environment. Professor Richard Thompson OBE FRS, Head of the International Marine Litter Research Unit, said:  For centuries, most everyday items including rope and netting used in the maritime industry was produced using natural resources. However, the large-scale increase in plastic production since the 1950s has resulted in plastics progressively replacing their natural counterparts. The durability of plastic has however resulted in a major environmental challenge once items reach the end of their lifetime or, as in this study, when they shed microplastics. Greater appreciation of the issues within wider society, are starting to make a difference. However, this study emphasises a previously unquantified yet substantive source of microplastics and reinforces the level of collaboration required to achieve lasting and positive change.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/sensor-can-differentiate-which-viruses-are-infectious-353928,Sensor Can Differentiate Which Viruses Are Infectious Researchers have developed a new sensor that can detect the presence and infectivity of a virus in minutes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new sensor can detect not only whether a virus is present, but whether it s infectious   an important distinction for containing viral spread.Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and collaborators developed the sensor, which integrates specially designed DNA fragments and nanopore sensing, to target and detect infectious viruses in minutes without the need to pre-treat samples. They demonstrated the sensor s power with two key viruses that cause infections worldwide: the human adenovirus and the virus that causes COVID-19.   Yi Lu, a professor emeritus of chemistry, and Benito Marinas, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, co-led the work with University of Illinois Chicago professor Lijun Rong; professor Omar Azzaroni, of the National University of La Plata in Argentina; and Mar a Eugenia Toimil-Molares, of the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany. They reported their findings in the journal Science Advances. The infectivity status is very important information that can tell us if patients are contagious or if an environmental disinfection method works,  said Ana Peinetti, the first author of the study, who performed the work while a postdoctoral researcher at Illinois. She now leads a research group at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.  Our sensor combines two key components: highly specific DNA molecules and highly sensitive nanopore technology. We developed these highly specific DNA molecules, named aptamers, that not only recognize viruses but also can differentiate the infectivity status of the virus. The  gold standard  of viral detection, PCR tests detect viral genetic material but cannot distinguish whether a sample is infectious or determine whether a person is contagious. This can make it more difficult to track and contain viral outbreaks, the researchers said. With the virus that causes COVID-19, it has been shown that the level of viral RNA has minimal correlation with the virus s infectivity. In the early stage when a person is infected, the viral RNA is low and difficult to detect, but the person is highly contagious,  Lu said.  When a person is recovered and not infectious, the viral RNA level can be very high. Antigen tests follow a similar pattern, though even later than viral RNA. Therefore, viral RNA and antigen tests are both poor in informing whether a virus is infectious or not. It may result in delayed treatment or quarantine, or premature release of those who may still be contagious. Tests that detect infectious viruses, called plaque assays, exist but require special preparation and days of incubation to render results. The new sensing method can yield results in 30 minutes to two hours, the researchers report, and since it requires no pre-treatment of the sample, it can be used on viruses that will not grow in the lab.Being able to distinguish infectious from noninfectious viruses and to detect small amounts from untreated samples that may contain other contaminants is important not only for rapid diagnosis of patients who are in the early stage of infection or who are still contagious after treatment, but for environmental monitoring as well, Marinas said. We chose human adenovirus to demonstrate our sensor because it is an emerging waterborne viral pathogen of concern in the United States and throughout the world,  Marinas said.  The capability to detect infectious adenovirus in the presence of viruses rendered noninfectious by water disinfectants, and other potentially interfering background substances in wastewaters and contaminated natural waters, provides an unprecedented novel approach. We see potential for such technology to provide more robust protection of environmental and public health. The sensing technique could be applied to other viruses, the researchers say, by tweaking the DNA to target different pathogens. The DNA aptamers used in the sensor can be readily produced with widely available DNA synthesizers, similarly to the RNA probes produced for PCR tests. Nanopore sensors are also commercially available, making the sensing technique readily scalable, said Lu, now a professor at the University of Texas, Austin.The researchers are working to further improve the sensors  sensitivity and selectivity, and are integrating their DNA aptamers with other detection methods, such as color-changing dipsticks or sensors to work with smartphones, to eliminate the need for special equipment. With the ability to distinguish noninfectious from infectious viruses, the researchers said they hope their technology could also aid in understanding mechanisms of infection. In addition, the aptamer technology could be further developed into multichannel platforms for detecting other emerging waterborne viral pathogens of public and environmental health concern, such as norovirus and enteroviruses, or for variants of the virus that causes COVID-19,  Marinas said.

Meanwhile, master gunners tinkered with gunpowder formulas, trying to find the ideal concoction. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Omega have recreated medieval gunpowder recipes and analyzed the energies released during combustion, revealing that the evolution of the perfect powder was a slow, trial-and-error process.Although largely obsolete in modern weaponry, gunpowder, also known as black powder, is still used in historical weapons, fireworks and pyrotechnics. The explosive is a combination of varying ratios of potassium nitrate (or  saltpeter ), sulfur and charcoal. Medieval recipes sometimes included interesting additives, such as camphor, varnish or brandy, with obscure purposes. Dawn Riegner, Cliff Rogers and their team of chemists and historians wanted to analyze the energetics of medieval gunpowder recipes to help understand the intent of master gunners in creating these formulas, as well as to provide important technical information about early gunpowder manufacturing. To do this, the researchers identified over 20 gunpowder recipes from medieval texts dated 1336 to 1449 A.D. They prepared the powders and measured the energies released just before and during combustion using differential scanning calorimetry and bomb calorimetry. They also tested a few of the recipes at a West Point firing range using a replica of an early 15th-century stone-throwing cannon. In general, in the period 1338 1400 A.D., the percentage of saltpeter increased and charcoal decreased, causing lower heats of combustion, which could have produced safer recipes for medieval gunners. After 1400 A.D., the percentage of saltpeter (the most expensive ingredient) decreased slightly, while sulfur and charcoal increased, raising the heat of combustion, although not as high as for the earliest recipes. Certain additives, such as the combination of camphor and ammonium chloride, appeared to make gunpowder stronger, whereas others, such as water or brandy, did not show energetic advantages, but might have served other purposes. For example, they might have made the material more stable during transport or storage. Although the researchers have characterized the gunpowders in the lab and in limited experiments on the firing range, more field work must be done to evaluate which formulation would perform the best in historical contexts, they say.ReferenceRitchie TS, Riegner KE, Seals RJ, Rogers CJ, Riegner DE.

Scientists at The Wistar Institute discovered that loss of ARID1A function enhances a cellular stress response pathway that promotes survival of cancer cells, which become sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of this pathway. These findings were published online in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, and point to a new therapeutic opportunity for this type of ovarian cancer for which new solutions are urgently needed.Inactivating mutations in the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene are genetic drivers of OCCC, which does not respond to chemotherapy and carries the worst prognosis among all subtypes of ovarian cancer. The goal of our research is to uncover the molecular changes caused by ARID1A loss so that we can target them specifically to achieve effective therapies for this devastating disease,  said Rugang Zhang, Ph.D., deputy director of The Wistar Institute Cancer Center, professor and leader of the Immunology, Microenvironment & Metastasis Program, and lead author of the study.  In this study, we focused on a stress response mechanism that tumors resort to for survival and found a link that offers a therapeutic opportunity. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cellular structure that oversees protein production and harbors complex mechanisms to respond to the stress caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins. The ER stress response is frequently hyperactivated in cancer cells to favor their survival in stressful microenvironment conditions. Therefore, inhibition of this mechanism has been explored as a therapeutic approach for cancers with hyperactive ER stress response.The IRE1a/XBP1 pathway is the major signaling pathway involved in the ER stress response. The protein Inositol-required enzyme alpha (IRE1a) senses ER stress and activates the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), resulting in upregulation of genes that resolve the ER stress and promote cell survival.Zhang and colleagues found that ARID1A inhibits the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway and, consequently, ARID1A loss in ovarian cancer causes an increased activation of the pathway, creating a dependence of cancer cells on upregulated IRE1a-XBP1. Indeed, treatment of ovarian cancer cells that do not express ARID1A with the selective IRE1  inhibitor B-I09 caused cell death as a result of unresolved ER stress. In some cases, the mechanisms cancer cells exploit to their advantage also make them vulnerable because they become dependent on certain pathways,  added Zhang.  If we can find ways to block those pathways, we may be able to use them as weak spots for killing cancer. Importantly, this observation was confirmed in vivo, as B-I09 treatment reduced tumor burden and improved survival in mouse models bearing ARID1A-inactivated ovarian tumors.Therapeutic resistance enables cancer cells to escape the effects of single agent treatments, and combination strategies offer a solution for this major challenge. Therefore, researchers tested the combination of IRE1a inhibition with histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibition, which is also effective against ARID1A-mutant cancers. Since HDAC6 regulates the degradation of misfolded proteins, the team hypothesized that the two treatments may act in synergy to suppress ARID1A-mutant cancers. Our findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response, alone or in combination with HDAC6 inhibition, represents a potential therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated cancers,  said Joseph Zundell, a pre-doctoral trainee in the Zhang lab and first author on the paper.Reference: Zundell JA, Fukumoto T, Lin J, et al.

Despite their tiny size, these micro-robotic swimmers   whose movements were inspired by bacteria and sperm   could one day be a formidable new tool for targeted drug delivery.For more than a decade, Mingming Wu s lab has been investigating the ways microorganisms, from bacteria to cancer cells, migrate and communicate with their environment. The goal was to create a remotely controlled micro-robot that could navigate in the human body.Wu s team initially tried to design and 3D print a micro-robot that mimicked the way bacteria use flagellum to propel themselves. However, like the early aviators whose cumbersome airplanes were too bird like to fly, that effort collapsed. Soon, they began exploring a less literal approach. The primary hurdle was how to power it. As a person must crawl before they can walk, a micro-robot needs to be energized before it can swim. Bacteria and sperm basically consume organic material in the surrounding fluid, and that is sufficient to power them,  Wu said.  But for engineered robots it s tough, because if they carry a battery, it s too heavy for them to move. The team hit upon the idea of using high-frequency sound waves. Because ultrasound is quiet, it can be easily used in an experimental lab setting. As an additional bonus, the technology has been deemed safe for clinical studies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Working with the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility (CNF), former postdoctoral researcher Tao Luo created a triangular micro-robotic swimmer that looks like an insect crossed with a rocket ship.The swimmer s most important feature is a pair of cavities etched in its back. Because its resin material is hydrophobic, when the robot is submerged in solution, a tiny air bubble is automatically trapped in each cavity. When an ultrasound transducer is aimed at the robot, the air bubble oscillates, generating vortices   also known as streaming flow   that propel the swimmer forward.Other engineers have previously built  single bubble  swimmers, but the Cornell researchers are the first to pioneer a version that uses two bubbles, each with a different diameter opening in their respective cavity. By varying the sound waves  resonance frequency, the researchers can excite either bubble   or tune them together   thereby controlling which direction the swimmer is propelled.The challenge ahead will be to make the swimmers biocompatible, so they can navigate among blood cells that are roughly the size as they are. Future micro-swimmers will also need to consist of biodegradable material, so that many bots can be dispatched at once. In the same way that only a single sperm needs to be successful for fertilization, the volume is key. For drug delivery, you could have a group of micro-robotic swimmers, and if one failed during the journey, that s not a problem. That s how nature survives,  Wu said.  In a way, it s a more robust system. Smaller does not mean weaker. A group of them is undefeatable. I feel like these nature-inspired tools typically are more sustainable, because nature has proved it works. Reference: Luo T, Wu M.

A significant hurdle in treatment for pediatric brain cancer is tailoring treatment plans to the variation and complexity of cancer cells in individual patients, according to Amir Sheikhi, assistant professor of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering.With a grant from the Meghan Rose Bradley Foundation, Sheikhi plans to develop a novel biomaterial that could be used to simulate the response of pediatric brain cancers to different approaches   and customized with cells from the patient to enable personalized treatments. The current treatments are not as efficient as they could be because the disease is unique to each patient,  Sheikhi said.  We are very hopeful that we can make a difference in the quality of life of people, particularly children, in this project. Sheikhi and his research team aim to design a new polymer-based biomaterial. This class of materials comprises chained-together molecules that, among other activities, can mimic the growth environment of cancer cells inside a tumor. The researchers plan to use soft, water-absorbent microengineered gels as a scaffold for patient-derived cells, which can then grow and form tissues.   The polymer will replicate the microenvironment that cells reside on inside the tumor,  Sheikhi said.  That environment is made of a range of biochemical and topological cues, so when cancer cells are added to it, they behave similarly to how they behave in patients  tumors. The researchers will begin by building a system using a single cancer cell on a simple scaffold and progressively increase the complexity of the system with the goal of mimicking a tumor outside of the human body that can be used to test different medications.Sheikhi also plans for the system to be easy for others to use regardless of scientific training.  We are very interested in developing a technology that is translational and has all the scientific standards to mimic a real tumor but is convenient so that people using it don t need experience in biomaterials,  he said.  Ultimately, when the system is fully ready in the future, we envision that all medical providers or researchers would need to do is add the right cells to the right location, culture them based on our recommendations and then have a functional imitation tumor to test treatments with.  Sheikhi will collaborate with several neuroscience experts, including James Connor, distinguished professor of neuroscience and anatomy and vice chair for research at the Penn State College of Medicine s Department of Neurosurgery.The Meghan Rose Bradley Foundation was established in 2004 in memory of Bradley, an honors student, multi-sport athlete and competitive dancer who died at the age of 16 from brain cancer.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The LC s name comes from the Latin for blue spot, its noticeable hue a product of intense chemical activity. This activity produces the brain s primary source of the vitally important neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, which controls our  fight-or-flight  response to stimuli in our environment, and plays roles in our sleep-wake cycle and emotional regulation.A new study, published in Science Translational Medicine, suggests changes in the LC might provide a novel way of indicating the early spread of Alzheimer s disease through the brain.The study was published by a collaborative group of researchers including Dr. Heidi Jacobs, an assistant professor at the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital. First author Jacobs spoke to Technology Networks about the difficulties in studying this region.  It s very deep in the brain, located in the pons. It s a really hard region to image with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tools because it s so low. In the scanner, the coils that go over your head end up just below the pons so that the signal that you are capturing becomes noisy. It s also very tiny, it s about 2 mm thick and 12 mm long. Standard MRI methods image in resolution of 1 or 2mm, so it s hard to capture,  explains Jacobs. Functional findingsJacobs s team showed that reductions in LC integrity were a key indicator of higher levels of tau protein accumulation in the entorhinal cortex. Increases in tau neurofibrillary tangles in the LC were associated with worse cortical pathology rating, called Braak staging, while reduction in pigmentation of the LC was associated with later Braak stages.Importantly, says Jacobs, the disease processes that most strongly related to the LC were those at the earliest stages of Alzheimer s disease, a sign that assessment of the LC could be used as a predictor for later disease spread.A final experiment showed that reduced integrity of the LC is associated with a more rapid decline in memory and executive function   key symptoms of Alzheimer s disease. What we ve shown is that the integrity of the LC is associated with these initial cortical patterns of tau pathology and cognitive decline,  says Jacobs. She explains that some researchers had believed changes in the LC were simply indicators of healthy aging, but these new findings show that the MRI signal could instead be an early biomarker of Alzheimer s.By providing an indication of disease risk decades before symptom onset, the LC signal, hopes Jacobs, could make for more successful clinical trials where early intervention is thought to be crucial to success.  We need to go earlier, and I think this is where the clinical implication of this work lies,  Jacobs concludes. ","Published: September 22, 2021"

Human antibodies have been a key treatment for serious cases during the pandemic, but typically need to be administered by infusion through a needle in hospital.Public Health England has described the research as having  significant potential for both the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 , adding that the nanobodies  are among the most effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agents we have ever tested. Nanobodies have a number of advantages over human antibodies,  said Professor Ray Owens, head of protein production at the Rosalind Franklin Institute and lead author of the research.  They are cheaper to produce and can be delivered directly to the airways through a nebuliser or nasal spray, so can be self-administered at home rather than needing an injection. This could have benefits in terms of ease of use by patients but it also gets the treatment directly to the site of infection in the respiratory tract. The research team, whose findings are published in the journal Nature Communication, were able to generate the nanobodies by injecting a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into a llama called Fifi, who is part of the antibody production facility at the University of Reading.The spike protein is found on the outside of the virus and is responsible for binding to human cells so it can infect them.Although the injections did not make Fifi sick, it triggered her immune system to fight off the virus protein by generating nanobodies against it. A small blood sample was then taken from the llama and the researchers were able to purify four nanobodies capable of binding to the Covid-19 virus.The nanobodies were then combined together into chains of three to increase their ability to bind to the virus. These were then produced in cells in the laboratory.The team found three nanobody chains were able to neutralise both the original variants of the Covid-19 virus and the Alpha variant that was first identified in Kent, UK. A fourth nanobody chain was able to neutralise the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.When one of the nanobody chains   also known as a trimer   were administered to hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, the animals showed a marked reduction in disease, losing far less weight after seven days than those who remained untreated. Hamsters that received the nanobody treatment also had a lower viral load in their lungs and airways after seven days than untreated animals. Because we can see every atom of the nanobody bound to the spike, we understand what makes these agents so special,  said Professor James Naismith, Director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, who helped lead the research.The results are the first step towards developing a new type of treatment against Covid-19, which could prove invaluable as the pandemic continues. While vaccines have proven extraordinarily successful, not everyone responds to vaccination and immunity can wane in individuals at different times,  said Professor Naismith.  Having medications that can treat the virus is still going to be very important, particularly as not all of the world is being vaccinated at the same speed and there remains a risk of new variants capable of bypassing vaccine immunity emerging. If successful and approved, nanobodies could provide an important treatment around the world as they are easier to produce than human antibodies and don t need to be stored in cold storage facilities, added Professor Naismith.The research team, which included scientists at the University of Liverpool, University of Oxford and Public Health England, now hope to obtain funding so they can conduct further research needed to prepare for clinical studies in humans.Prof Miles Carroll, Deputy Director of the National Infection Service, Public Health England (PHE), said:  Although this research is still at an early stage, it opens up significant possibilities for the use of effective nanobody treatments for COVID-19. These are among the most effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agents we have ever tested at PHE. We believe the unique structure and strength of the nanobodies contribute to their significant potential for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and look forward to working collaboratively to progress this work into clinical studies. Dr Andrew Bourne, Director of Partnerships at EPSRC, said: Utilising the unique properties of llamas  nanobodies, this research could lead to an important new form of treatment for Covid-19 that is cheaper to produce and easier to administer. It is a vivid illustration of the impact that long-term discovery research at the cutting edge of physical and life sciences, as undertaken at the Rosalind Franklin Institute, can have. Professor James Stewart, co-author and professor of molecular virology at the University of Liverpool said:  The pre-clinical trials of the nanobodies in hamsters are extremely encouraging and suggest that they may be effective at treating COVID-19 disease as well as help prevent infection. Having therapies such as this will be important for populations that are either unvaccinated or where vaccination is inappropriate or ineffective. The researchers, who were funded by the UK Research and Innovation s Medical Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, The EPA Cephalosporin Fund and Wellcome, also hope the nanobody technology they have developed could form a so-called  platform technology  that can be rapidly adapted to fight other diseases. When a new virus emerges in the future, the generic technology we have developed could respond to that, which would be important in terms of producing new treatments as quickly as possible,  said Professor Owens.Reference: Huo J, Mikolajek H, Le Bas A, et al.

We can perform very complex information processing tasks in a fraction of the time using much less computer resources compared to what reservoir computing can currently do,  Gauthier said. And reservoir computing was already a significant improvement on what was previously possible. The study was published today (Sept. 21, 2021) in the journal Nature Communications.Reservoir computing is a machine learning algorithm developed in the early 2000s and used to solve the  hardest of the hard  computing problems, such as forecasting the evolution of dynamical systems that change over time, Gauthier said.Dynamical systems, like the weather, are difficult to predict because just one small change in one condition can have massive effects down the line, he said.One famous example is the  butterfly effect,  in which   in one metaphorical example   changes created by a butterfly flapping its wings can eventually influence the weather weeks later.Previous research has shown that reservoir computing is well-suited for learning dynamical systems and can provide accurate forecasts about how they will behave in the future, Gauthier said.It does that through the use of an artificial neural network, somewhat like a human brain. Scientists feed data on a dynamical network into a  reservoir  of randomly connected artificial neurons in a network. The network produces useful output that the scientists can interpret and feed back into the network, building a more and more accurate forecast of how the system will evolve in the future.The larger and more complex the system and the more accurate that the scientists want the forecast to be, the bigger the network of artificial neurons has to be and the more computing resources and time that are needed to complete the task.One issue has been that the reservoir of artificial neurons is a  black box,  Gauthier said, and scientists have not known exactly what goes on inside of it   they only know it works.The artificial neural networks at the heart of reservoir computing are built on mathematics, Gauthier explained. We had mathematicians look at these networks and ask,  To what extent are all these pieces in the machinery really needed?  he said.In this study, Gauthier and his colleagues investigated that question and found that the whole reservoir computing system could be greatly simplified, dramatically reducing the need for computing resources and saving significant time.They tested their concept on a forecasting task involving a weather system developed by Edward Lorenz, whose work led to our understanding of the butterfly effect.Their next-generation reservoir computing was a clear winner over today s state of-the-art on this Lorenz forecasting task. In one relatively simple simulation done on a desktop computer, the new system was 33 to 163 times faster than the current model.But when the aim was for great accuracy in the forecast, the next-generation reservoir computing was about 1 million times faster. And the new-generation computing achieved the same accuracy with the equivalent of just 28 neurons, compared to the 4,000 needed by the current-generation model, Gauthier said.An important reason for the speed-up is that the  brain  behind this next generation of reservoir computing needs a lot less warmup and training compared to the current generation to produce the same results.Warmup is training data that needs to be added as input into the reservoir computer to prepare it for its actual task. For our next-generation reservoir computing, there is almost no warming time needed,  Gauthier said. Currently, scientists have to put in 1,000 or 10,000 data points or more to warm it up. And that s all data that is lost, that is not needed for the actual work. We only have to put in one or two or three data points,  he said.And once researchers are ready to train the reservoir computer to make the forecast, again, a lot less data is needed in the next-generation system.In their test of the Lorenz forecasting task, the researchers could get the same results using 400 data points as the current generation produced using 5,000 data points or more, depending on the accuracy desired. What s exciting is that this next generation of reservoir computing takes what was already very good and makes it significantly more efficient,  Gauthier said.He and his colleagues plan to extend this work to tackle even more difficult computing problems, such as forecasting fluid dynamics. That s an incredibly challenging problem to solve. We want to see if we can speed up the process of solving that problem using our simplified model of reservoir computing.

The neuronal activity required to scan the next word in a sentence also increases according to the complexity of the word, the researchers found.The insights gained by the research team, based in the University s Centre for Human Brain Health, could help support diagnosis and training programmes for people with certain types of dyslexia where the pre-processing of words is impaired.The team has also used the principles highlighted in their study to propose a new theory for how humans perceive other, more general scenes as they observe and navigate the world around them.In a second, theoretical paper, published in Trends in Cognitive Neuroscience, the team suggests that humans do not necessarily perceive objects simply one after another (in series), and nor do they perceive items simultaneously (in parallel). Instead, they establish a pipeline of observations, in which meaning from one object is established while another region of the brain is simultaneously deciding which next item is important.These processes are co-ordinated by alpha waves in the brain and they happen extremely rapidly, with the eye moving around 3-4 times every second.Yali Pan, a co-author on both studies, said:  The speed at which the participants in our experiment were able to recognise the complexity of the next word in the sequence was really remarkable, and much faster than we predicted. In the experimental study, the team used a combination of eye tracking technology and measurements of magnetic fields in the brain to assess this activity. While eye tracking can be used to pinpoint how the eye moves and what object or word it fixates on, magnetoencephalography, or MEG, reveals  what is going on  behind the scenes  as the brain processes this information.The researchers asked 39 participants aged between 18 and 35 to read a series of sentences on a screen. In each sentence, one word was  tagged    it was programmed to flicker at a high frequency (60Hz). Although the participants could not detect this consciously, it was picked up by a specific region of their brain and detected by the MEG sensors.By monitoring both MEG signals and eye tracking, the researchers were able to get a detailed picture of what the participants were fixating on different words in a text, and then how different regions of the brain processed that information.Professor Ole Jensen, also a co-author, said:  Understanding how the brain decodes written information can help us develop more sophisticated diagnostic tools for conditions such as dyslexia. Our research has clearly shown that eye tracking and brain scanning must be studied together to get meaningful insights into these processes. Co-author Dr Steven Frisson added:  It s fascinating to see how different brain regions are responsible for different types of visual processing, and how these observations can give us entirely new insights into the links between visual perception and meaning in the brain.

One way NMR data can be used is to understand proteins and chemical reactions in the human body. NMR is closely related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for medical diagnosis.NMR spectrometers allow scientists to characterize the structure of molecules, such as proteins, but it can take highly skilled human experts a significant amount of time to analyze that data. This new machine learning method can analyze the data much more quickly and just as accurately.In a study recently published in Nature Communications, the scientists described their process, which essentially teaches computers to untangle complex data about atomic-scale properties of proteins, parsing them into individual, readable images. To be able to use these data, we need to separate them into features from different parts of the molecule and quantify their specific properties,  said Rafael Br schweiler, senior author of the study, Ohio Research Scholar and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at The Ohio State University.  And before this, it was very difficult to use computers to identify these individual features when they overlapped. The process, developed by Dawei Li, lead author of the study and a research scientist at Ohio State s Campus Chemical Instrument Center, teaches computers to scan images from NMR spectrometers. Those images, known as spectra, appear as hundreds and thousands of peaks and valleys, which, for example, can show changes to proteins or complex metabolite mixtures in a biological sample, such as blood or urine, at the atomic level. The NMR data give important information about a protein s function and important clues about what is happening in a person s body.But deconstructing the spectra into readable peaks can be difficult because often, the peaks overlap. The effect is almost like a mountain range, where closer, larger peaks obscure smaller ones that may also carry important information. Think of the QR code readers on your phone: NMR spectra are like a QR code of a molecule   every protein has its own specific  QR code,  Br schweiler said.  However, the individual pixels of these  QR codes  can overlap with each other to a significant degree. Your phone would not be able to decipher them. And that is the problem we have had with NMR spectroscopy and that we were able to solve by teaching a computer to accurately read these spectra. The process involves creating an artificial deep neural network, a multi-layered network of nodes that the computer uses to separate and analyze data.The researchers created that network, then taught it to analyze NMR spectra by feeding spectra that had already been analyzed by a person into the computer and telling the computer the previously known correct result. The process of teaching a computer to analyze spectra is almost like teaching a child to read   the researchers started with very simple spectra. Once the computer understood that, the researchers moved on to more complex sets. Eventually, they fed highly complex spectra of different proteins and from a mouse urine sample into the computer.The computer, using the deep neural network that had been taught to analyze spectra, was able to parse out the peaks in the highly complex sample with the same accuracy as a human expert, the researchers found. And more, the computer did it faster and highly reproducibly.Reference: Li D-W, Hansen AL, Yuan C, Bruschweiler-Li L, Br schweiler R.

Further insight into this role could aid our understanding of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth or cell death.Prions are proteins that are abnormally folded into different shapes. Prions can spread or be passed on to new cells. They have famously been linked to two deadly brain diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Mad Cow disease. But some prions can be helpful. Each shape of prion may perform a different task in the cell, in a similar way to a Swiss Army knife. While scientists have known about prions for decades, we don t yet know what distinguishes beneficial prions from harmful ones,  says co-first author David Garcia, PhD, who was a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Chemical Systems Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine, California, US, and is now Assistant Professor at the Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, US.To learn more, Garcia and colleagues studied a yeast enzyme called pseudouridine synthase that can take on two different shapes. They found that, in its alter-ego prion form, this enzyme causes yeast to multiply and grow more quickly, although these changes come at the cost of a shorter lifespan for the yeast.Through computer modelling, the team then showed that the changes brought about by the prion are beneficial when environmental resources are abundant, but harmful when resources are scarce. By reducing a so-called protein  chaperone , they also showed that the prion can revert to its original enzyme shape. Since protein chaperones themselves fluctuate during changing conditions, they propose that this might be a way to turn the prion on or off when desirable. We ve identified a new role for prions in which they can transform cell growth and survival,  says co-first author Edgar Campbell, a PhD student in Chemical and Systems Biology at Stanford Medicine.  These findings suggest that prions may be another form of epigenetic control of cells. Epigenetic changes can alter the behaviour of cells without changing their DNA, can be passed on to new generations of cells, and may be turned on or off by environmental conditions. The authors suggest that learning more about the role of prions in epigenetic control may be critical to improving our understanding of prion diseases. These types of epigenetic changes are missed when we sequence genomes but can still have a major influence on cell growth,  concludes senior author Daniel Jarosz, PhD, Associate Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology and Developmental Biology at Stanford Medicine.  It is critical to learn more about the consequences of prion-driven epigenetic changes in cells and find new ways to search for them in yeast and other organisms.

Roughly 40% of women over 60 will experience what s known as female pattern hair loss (also known as androgenetic alopecia). However, a new study suggests that a nutraceutical supplement may improve hair growth and quality. The study results will be presented during The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, September 22-25, 2021.Hair shedding or thinning is a devastating reality for most women as they age, as it can have a strong impact on self-esteem and emotional well-being. Unfortunately, the therapeutic options on the market are limited.The new study out of California suggests that a nutraceutical supplement   with nutrient-derived bioactive compounds derived from food sources   may effectively promote hair growth in peri-, menopausal, and postmenopausal women whose hormone changes are associated with decreased hair growth, as well as percentage of hairs and time spent in the anagen phase (when hair follicles form a new hair shaft). These findings offer hope for women near the menopause transition who are experiencing hair shedding or loss.Researchers compared results at 6 months and 12 months of treatment and found that mean total hair counts increased significantly and progressively. Global hair quality improvements significantly increased by 40% with few or no side effects, along with a decrease in hair shedding. With the aging of our society and the fact that women now spend approximately one-third of their lives in the postmenopausal period, research into interventions for menopause symptoms, including hair thinning, is critical, especially with therapeutic options being so limited,  says Dr. Glynis Ablon of the Ablon Skin Institute and Research Center in California and lead author of the study. Hair loss is a significant concern for midlife women,  says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, NAMS medical director.  Additional research will help confirm the long-term efficacy of nutraceutical supplements.

Such phenomena, however, are difficult to measure in experiments, and theoretical frameworks explaining them continue to be at odds with one another. Researchers in Italy, Japan, and Poland seek to point a way toward a unified theory for how DNA changes shape when expressing genes. Presenting their work in Biophysics Reviews, published by AIP Publishing, the scientists use an approach called statistical mechanics to explore the phenomenon of so-called expression waves of gene regulation.The group hopes to reconcile a long-standing gulf between the two scientific fields most involved in the topic.""Many scholars at the crossroad between physics and biology are now approaching what is probably the most crucial puzzle of biology,"" said co-author Alessandro Giuliani. ""How is it possible that, starting from the same genetic background in the fertilized egg, around 400 highly differentiated cell types can arise, each endowed with a specific physiological role?""Biology-based theories often center on regulator proteins, called transcription factors, that biochemically conduct a symphony of genes to be expressed together. By contrast, many physicists have focused on expression waves, the rhythmic changes in expression levels across the genome, driven by relaxation and condensing of the DNA molecule itself.""It is something like the so-called hola, common in soccer and in other sport events, in which the spectators stand up simultaneously giving rise to a 'wave' spreading all over the stadium,"" Giuliani said.To get at the heart of the issue, the group focuses on a specific type of cell found in breast cancer with a proven track record of consistently behaving the same way to stimuli.They used statistical mechanics to make sense of how DNA molecules fold by assessing the collective behavior of a huge number of microscopic players in terms of ensemble properties, unlike classical top-down perspectives, like Newton's laws.Ultimately, the researchers landed in favor of expression waves, acknowledging that while transcription factors play a vital role, they are second fiddle to the changing shape of DNA.To unify these two perspectives, the authors present their conclusion using concepts common to biology and physics, limiting the use of mathematics to intuitive approaches such as recurrence quantification analysis and the classical statistical method of principal component analysis.Next, they look to apply the same approach to identify ecological tipping points based on the makeup of species in particular habitats.Reference: Zimatore G, Tsuchiya M, Hashimoto M, Kasperski A, Giuliani A.

Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against the virus all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2.Both viral and cellular proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models.In this study, led by the University of Liverpool and the Institut Pasteur in Paris, researchers used a mass spectrometry approach to study proteolytic cleavage events during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mass spectrometry-based approaches to identify protease substrates have existed for a number of years however, they have seen only limited application to the study of viral substrates, and had not been previously applied to the study of proteolysis during coronavirus infection,  explains lead author Dr Emmott Edward, a Tenure-Track Fellow at the University s Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology.The team found previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts.They discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and identified 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays.They went on to show that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS CoV-2 titres.Both Bafetinib (an experimental cancer drug) and Sorafenib (an approved drug used to treat kidney and liver cancer) showed SARS-CoV-2 inhibition at concentrations that did not result in cytotoxicity in a human cell line model of infection.Dr Emmott said:  An improved understanding of the exact ways in which proteolytic cleavage is regulated, modulates protein activity, and serves to benefit viral replication will be crucial for targeting cellular substrates of viral proteases as a therapeutic strategy. As further SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, the incorporation of post translational modification data from studies such as this can also support efforts to predict phenotypes from genetic data on emerging variants.

Lewy bodies are hallmarks of Parkinson s disease, the most common movement disorder affecting about 1.2 million people in the United States and Canada. Currently, there are no treatments that slow the progression of Parkinson s disease   they only treat the symptoms,  says Kalipada Pahan, PhD, the Floyd A. Davis Professor of Neurology at Rush University Medical Center and a research career scientist at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, who led the study.Lewy bodies are also associated with the development of Lewy body dementia and a rare neurological disorder called multiple system atrophy (MSA).  At present, there is also no effective treatment for dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy,  Pahan says.  Understanding how these diseases work is important to developing effective drugs that inhibit alpha-synuclein pathology, protect the brain, and stop the progression of Lewy body diseases. The lab-developed peptides tested in the study are known as TLR2-interacting domain of Myd88 (TIDM) and NEMO-binding domain (NBD). The drugs, which were delivered through the nose, were found to slow inflammation in the brain and stop the spread of alpha-synuclein in mice with Parkinson s disease. The treatments also improved the mice s gait, balance, and other motor functions. If these results can be replicated in patients, it would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of devastating neurological disorders,  Pahan says.The research was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health.

Bioengineer Kevin McHugh of Rice s George R. Brown School of Engineering has received a five-year, $1.9 million National Institutes of Health grant to fix that by refining the shapes of their microscopic particles.His lab s initial goal is to provide a platform that offers better drug performance and the prospect of fewer injections for patients.The grant administered by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences will allow McHugh and his team to refine the morphology of drug particles meant to degrade over long time scales. He said most particles delivered now release less and less of their contents over time, which can result in too much drug early on and not enough at later time points.  The earliest controlled-release and most clinically advanced injectables are all made of the same polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid),  said McHugh, an assistant professor of bioengineering who joined Rice as a CPRIT Scholar in 2019.  It s super common, but your control over drug encapsulation and release is rather limited because it is bulk-degrading. There s almost always a burst of the drug released right away, and then the rate decreases. They re good enough in some cases, but we d like to expand the types of drugs compatible with these systems as well as the duration over which controlled-release formulations can act,  he said.  We re trying to leverage structure-function relationships to make particles that act predictably over their lifetimes by controlling their surface area.  McHugh is also interested in using the delivery system to release biological drugs -- those produced from or with components from living organisms -- whose usage has increased dramatically over the past decade due to their specificity and potency.He said labs have only recently gained the ability to design and 3D print prototype particles that measure in tens to hundreds of microns, small enough to slip through a needle into a patient s tissue. These won t be nanoparticles to inject into the blood,  McHugh said.  Like a vaccine, they would be injected into muscle and they ll stay there and release their drugs. For chronic diseases, the idea would be to get a systemic drug level that is constant, high enough to be effective and low enough to maintain safety.  But there s also the opportunity to treat a specific site, like a tumor,  he said.  You can administer these particles within the tumor and have them release cancer drugs for the next month. Ultimately, McHugh said the strategy can be extended to multipurpose injections that deliver drugs in sequence when and where patients need them. That could dramatically reduce the number of injections they have to endure and also improve patient adherence to dosing schedules, which can be as low as 50% for some chronic diseases.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Conversely, a more relaxed parenting style, eating together as a family, and involving a child in the preparation if food all reduced the likelihood of fussy eating.Lead researcher and USC PhD student Laine Chilman says the research hopes to help parents and carers better understand fussy eating in children. For parents with a fussy eater, mealtimes can be especially stressful   juggling the family meal and a picky eater is no small feat,  Chilman says. Some families have kids who turn their noses up at any vegetable. Others are dealing with kids who dislike certain textures or colours of food. Some of these preferences relate to a child s characteristics or personality, which are difficult to change, if at all. But others are external factors that could help reduce fussy eating in kids. Eating together as a family, with siblings, and having a single meal at a regular time all helped reduce food fussiness. As did getting the fussy child involved in the meal, either by helping to choose the menu, or helping to prepare the meal. Yet if fussy eaters were allowed to eat in front of the TV, or if they were rewarded for eating certain foods, these behaviours negatively influenced picky children. According to the Australian Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey, most children do not meet recommended diet and nutrition guidelines.UniSA researcher Dr Ann Kennedy-Behr says stress can contribute to fussy eating.  When you have a child who is a picky eater, it s very stressful for a parent or carer   they re forever questioning whether their child is getting enough nutrients, enough food, and often enough weight gain,  Dr Kennedy-Behr says. Yet it s important to understand that being overtly anxious or worried can actually contribute to increased picky eating. Avoiding getting cross and limiting any negativity around mealtime will be benefit everyone. Positive parenting, no matter how difficult it can be in certain situations, is the best step forward for fussy eaters.

One of the most powerful imaging tools in a researcher s arsenal, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can visualize proteins, pathogens and sundry cell components almost down to their individual atoms.But preparing samples for cryo-EM is cumbersome process that relies on ethane   a powerful coolant in liquid form, and a flammable gas at room temperature prone to explosions.A new study published Sept. 7 in the journal of the International Union of Crystallography demonstrates that cryo-EM samples can be prepared with a safer and less expensive coolant   liquid nitrogen   and these samples can produce even sharper images than those prepared with ethane. The findings upend conventional wisdom dating back to the 1980s, and may improve the safety and quality of cryo-EM. Ethane is not a standard lab chemical. It is hazardous, and using it adds additional complications,  said senior author Robert Thorne, professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences and a Weiss Presidential Fellow.  Liquid nitrogen is the coolant of choice. Cryo-EM works by firing electrons through molecules that are flash frozen in a glassy sheet of water, capturing multiple fuzzy images of the molecules within the ice. Sophisticated software can often average those blurry clips into one crisp 3D image, but not consistently.Some of the blurriness comes from the sample itself. When the water encasing the molecules is cooled too slowly, it forms ice crystals that degrade the image. Scientists circumvent this problem by using ethane to cool the water so quickly that it snaps into a glassy, crystal-free sheet. But such rapid freezing puts stress on the sheet, which rests on a thin film of gold. When the electron beam hits the sheet, stress causes the molecules to move, blurring the final image in a phenomenon known as beam-induced motion. We have two opposing factors,  Thorne said.  We want to cool the samples fast, to prevent ice crystal formation and to capture the biological structure of the molecules. But we also want to cool the samples as slowly as possible to minimize their motion during imaging. Ethane cools samples very quickly. But researchers must use liquid nitrogen to convert ethane gas into a liquid, and then more liquid nitrogen to store samples after they are frozen.  Ethane is cumbersome, it s dangerous, and, ultimately, the samples end up in liquid nitrogen anyway,  Thorne said.Liquid nitrogen cools at rates roughly 50 times slower than those of ethane, according to reports over the last 40 years, and that s not fast enough to convert water into a glassy sheet. But in 2006, Thorne s research group discovered the main factor slowing down nitrogen was cold gas hovering above the surface of the liquid, which cooled small samples before they ever got to the liquid.Thorne s company, MiTeGen, eventually developed an automated cooling instrument for X-ray crystallography   another method used to image protein molecules   that removes the cold gas just before a sample is plunged into nitrogen, and found that cooling rates increased to a mere six times slower than ethane. MiTeGen staff then adapted their cooling instrument for cryo-EM samples and collaborated with staff at the Cornell Center for Materials Research and postdoctoral associate Jonathan Clinger to collect and analyze cryo-EM data.As the new study reports, nitrogen cools at the perfect speed for cryo-EM sample preparation   fast enough to avoid significant ice crystal formation, but slow enough to reduce beam-induced motion later on. Ethane is overkill,  Thorne said.  For speed you don t need, you re getting blurry images with beam-induced motion, and that is more problematic than any ice crystals that form from slightly slower cooling. And all-liquid nitrogen cooling, Thorne said, will simplify cryo-EM workflows, removing the extra steps demanded by ethane and making it easier to design automated cooling instruments that meet current lab safety standards. This is a nice illustration of how basic academic science   looking into how small objects cool and how ice forms within them   can lead to practical solutions and commercial products.

The research is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.  This study relates to the fate of nuclear materials in nature, and we stumbled upon a previously unknown mechanism by which certain radioactive elements could spread in the environment,  said LLNL scientist and lead author Gauthier Deblonde.  We show that there are molecules in nature that were not considered before, notably proteins like  lanmodulin  that could have a strong impact on radioelements that are problematic for nuclear waste management, such as americium, curium, etc.  Past and present nuclear activities (e.g., for energy, research or weapon tests) have increased the urgency to understand the behavior of radioactive materials in the environment. Nuclear wastes containing actinides (e.g. plutonium, americium, curium and neptunium) are particularly problematic, as they remain radioactive and toxic for thousands of years. However, very little is known about the chemical form of these elements in the environment, forcing scientists and engineers to use models to predict their long-term behavior and migration patterns. Thus far, these models have only considered interactions with small natural compounds, mineral phases and colloids, and the impact of more complex compounds like proteins has been largely ignored. The new study demonstrates that a type of protein that is abundant in nature vastly outcompetes molecules that scientists previously considered as the most problematic in terms of actinide migration in the environment.  The recent discovery that some bacteria specifically use rare-earth elements has opened new areas of biochemistry with important technological applications and potential implications for actinide geochemistry, because of chemical similarities between the rare-earths and actinides,  said Joseph Cotruvo Jr., Penn State assistant professor and co-corresponding author on the paper. The protein called lanmodulin is a small and abundant protein in many rare-earth-utilizing bacteria. It was discovered by the Penn State members of the team in 2018. While the Penn State and LLNL team has studied in detail how this remarkable protein works and how it can be applied to extract rare-earths, the protein s relevance to radioactive contaminants in the environment was previously unexplored.  Our results suggest that lanmodulin, and similar compounds, play a more important role in the chemistry of actinides in the environment than we could have imagined,  said LLNL scientist Annie Kersting.  Our study also points to the important role that selective biological molecules can play in the differential migration patterns of synthetic radioisotopes in the environment.   The study also shows for the first time that lanmodulin prefers the actinide elements over any other metals, including the rare-earth elements, an interesting property than could be used for novel separation processes,  said LLNL scientist Mavrik Zavarin. Rare-earth element biochemistry is a very recent field that Penn State and LLNL have helped to pioneer, and the new work is the first to explore how the environmental chemistry of actinides may be linked to nature s use of rare-earth elements. Lanmodulin s higher affinity for actinides might even mean that rare-earth-utilizing organisms that are ubiquitous in nature may preferentially incorporate certain actinides into their biochemistry, according to Deblonde.ReferenceDeblonde GJ-P, Mattocks JA, Wang H, et al.

This was shown in a recent study funded by the Medical Science Fund of the Mayor of the City of Vienna and conducted by an interdisciplinary team led by Klaus Schmetterer, Robert Strassl (both Department of Laboratory Medicine) and Johannes Kovarik (Department of Medicine III) at MedUni Vienna and Vienna General Hospital. The study has now been published in the leading journal  Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology .Due to an overreaction of the immune system, infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a severe clinical course of disease, potentially including multiple organ failure. Schmetterer explains: ""This has already been shown in multiple studies, but the problem with it was that the previous data could only be obtained at a later stage of the disease from seriously ill patients in intensive care units. Data from the early phase of COVID-19 infection and appropriate control groups were often lacking. Therefore, it has been largely unclear whether the immune system responds differently to SARS-CoV-2 in the early post-infection period than it does to the known seasonal respiratory viruses."" In order to better define the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the interdisciplinary team used a cohort of outpatients who visited the University Hospital Vienna with typical symptoms of a viral respiratory infection. ""These patients presented with the typical symptoms that can occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also with other viral respiratory infections (e.g. fever, shortness of breath, cough, ). For the purposes of this study, we deliberately selected patients who visited the Vienna General Hospital within the first two days after the onset of symptoms and had no known pre-existing conditions,"" explains Robert Strassl. Based on PCR test results, the patients were divided into a COVID-19 positive group and a COVID-19 negative group, i.e. patients with other infections. The researchers additionally included a third comparison group of healthy subjects.  For the study, all groups were tested for a total of 65 immune markers in blood plasma. This provided a detailed insight into the complex immunological processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection: ""We were actually able to define four messenger substances (NB: BLC, sCD30, MCP-2 and IP-10) that are elevated in the blood of patients in the early phase following infection with SARS-CoV-2 but not in other viral infections,"" says the first author of the study, Johannes Kovarik. Firstly, the results of these investigations could provide starting points for future therapeutic approaches for Covid-19, and secondly, the new findings could also constitute important comparative parameters for further studies, for example on chronic forms of the disease such as ""Long COVID"".ReferenceKovarik JJ et al.

Current treatment options for memory loss are very limited and the search for safe and effective drug therapies has, until now, had limited success.The research was done in collaboration with colleagues at the international biopharmaceutical company Sosei Heptares. The findings, published in Nature Communications, identify specific receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that re-route information flowing through memory circuits in the hippocampus. Acetylcholine is released in the brain during learning and is critical for the acquisition of new memories. Until now, the only effective treatment for the symptoms of cognitive or memory impairment seen in diseases such as Alzheimer s is using drugs that broadly boost acetylcholine. However, this leads to multiple adverse side effects. The discovery of specific receptor targets that have the potential to provide the positive effects whilst avoiding the negative ones is promising.Lead author, Professor Jack Mellor, from the University of Bristol s Centre for Synaptic Plasticity, said:  These findings are about the fundamental processes that occur in the brain during the encoding of memory and how they may be regulated by brain state or drugs targeting specific receptor proteins. In the long-term, the discovery of these specific targets opens up avenues and opportunities for the development of new treatments for the symptoms of Alzheimer s disease and other conditions with prominent cognitive impairments. The academic-industry partnership is important for these discoveries and we hope to continue working together on these projects. Dr Miles Congreve, Chief Scientific Officer at Sosei Heptares, added:  These important studies have helped us to design and select new, exquisitely targeted therapeutic agents that mimic the effects of acetylcholine at specific muscarinic receptors, without triggering the unwanted side effects of earlier and less-well targeted treatments. This approach has the exciting potential to improve memory and cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer s and other neurological diseases. It is fascinating how the brain prioritises different bits of information, working out what is important to encode in memory and what can be discarded. We know there must be mechanisms to pull out the things that are important to us but we know very little about how these processes work. Our future programme of work aims to reveal how the brain does this using acetylcholine in tandem with other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline,  said Professor Mellor.Reference: Palacios-Filardo J, Udakis M, Brown GA, et al.

In blood circulation, they repetitively encounter various levels of oxygen tension. Hypoxia, a low oxygen tension condition, is a very common micro-environmental factor in physiological processes of blood circulation and various pathological processes such as cancer, chronic inflammation, heart attacks and stroke. In addition, an interplay between poor cellular deformability and impaired oxygen delivery is found in various pathological processes such as sickle cell disease. Sickle red blood cells simultaneously undergo drastic mechanical deformation during the sickling and unsickling process.The interactions between hypoxia and cell biomechanics and the underlying biochemical mechanisms of the accelerated damage in diseased red blood cells are well understood, however, the exact biomechanical consequences of hypoxia contributing to red blood cell degradation (aging) remains elusive.Researchers from Florida Atlantic University s College of Engineering and Computer Science , in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), sought to identify the role of hypoxia on red blood cell aging via the biomechanical pathways. In particular, they examined hypoxia-induced impairment of red blood cell deformability at the single cell level, compared the differences between non-cyclic hypoxia and cyclic hypoxia, and documented any cumulative effect vs. hypoxia cycles, such as aspects that have not been studied quantitatively. Red blood cell deformability is an important biomarker of its functionality.For the study, published in the journal Lab on a Chip , researchers developed a multifaceted microfluidic in vitro assay to precisely control the gaseous environment while probing the mechanical performance of red blood cells, which can be used as a characterization tool for other cell types involved in oxygen-dependent biological processes. The assay holds promise for investigating hypoxic effects on the metastatic potential and relevant drug resistance of cancer cells. Cancer cells are more metastatic in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment and cancer cell stiffness has been shown to be an effective biomarker of their metastatic potential.Findings from the study indicate an important biophysical mechanism underlying red blood cell aging in which the cyclic hypoxia challenge alone can lead to mechanical degradation of the red blood cell membrane. This process in combination with the deformation-induced mechanical fatigue represents two major fatigue loading conditions that circulating red blood cells experience. A unique feature of our system lies in that the cell deformability measurement can be made on multiple, individually tracked red blood cells under a well-controlled oxygen tension environment,  said Sarah Du, Ph.D., senior author, an associate professor in FAU s Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, and a member of FAU s Institute for Human Health and Disease Intervention (I-HEALTH).   Our results showed that the deformability of red blood cells decreases under deoxygenation conditions by before-and-after mechanical characterization of individual cells in response to the switching of oxygen levels within a microfluidic device. Microfluidics serves as a miniaturized and efficient platform for gas diffusion by interfacing the gas and aqueous solution through flow or a gas-permeable membrane, which also is amenable to the control of the cellular gaseous microenvironment.For the study, researchers subjected red blood cells to a well-controlled repeated hypoxia microenvironment while allowing simultaneous characterization of the cell mechanical properties. They integrated an electro-deformation technique into a microdiffusion chamber, which was easy to implement and flexible in simultaneous applications of cyclic hypoxia challenge and shear stresses on individual cells in suspension and under quasi-stationary conditions.Measurements of biomarkers, such as oxidative damage, can provide additional information to establish quantitative relationships between the fatigue loading and the biological processes, allowing a better understanding of red blood cell failure and aging. The microfluidic assay also can be extended to study other types of biological cells for their mechanical performance and response to gaseous environments. The unique method developed by professor Du s lab also can be a useful tool to predict the mechanical performance of natural and artificial red blood cells for transfusion purposes as well as to assess the efficacy of relevant reagents in extending the cellular lifespan in circulation,  said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean, College of Engineering and Computer Science.  This promising and cutting-edge assay has the potential to further extend to red blood cells in other blood diseases and other cell types. Reference: Qiang Y, Liu J, Dao M, Du E.

Higher intakes of dairy fat were not associated with an increased risk of death.Researchers then combined the results of this study in just over 4,000 Swedish adults with those from 17 similar studies in other countries, creating the most comprehensive evidence to date on the relationship between this more objective measure of dairy fat consumption, risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Dr Matti Marklund from The George Institute for Global Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Uppsala University said that with dairy consumption on the rise worldwide, a better understanding of the health impact was needed.  Many studies have relied on people being able to remember and record the amounts and types of dairy foods they ve eaten, which is especially difficult given that dairy is commonly used in a variety of foods. Instead, we measured blood levels of certain fatty acids, or fat  building blocks  that are found in dairy foods, which gives a more objective measure of dairy fat intake that doesn t rely on memory or the quality of food databases,  he added.  We found those with the highest levels actually had the lowest risk of CVD. These relationships are highly interesting, but we need further studies to better understand the full health impact of dairy fats and dairy foods.  Dairy and dairy product consumption in Sweden is among the highest worldwide. An international collaboration between researchers in Sweden, the US and Australia assessed dairy fat consumption in 4150 Swedish 60-year-olds by measuring blood levels of a particular fatty acid that is mainly found in dairy foods and therefore can be used to reflect intake of dairy fat. They were then followed up for an average of 16 years to see how many had heart attacks, strokes and other serious circulatory events, and how many died from any cause during this time. After statistically adjusting for other known CVD risk factors including things like age, income, lifestyle, dietary habits, and other diseases, the CVD risk was lowest for those with high levels of the fatty acid (reflecting high intake of dairy fats). Those with the highest levels had no increased risk of death from all causes. Dr Marklund added that the findings highlight the uncertainty of evidence in this area, which is reflected in dietary guidelines.  While some dietary guidelines continue to suggest consumers choose low-fat dairy products, others have moved away from that advice, instead suggesting dairy can be part of a healthy diet with an  emphasis on selecting certain dairy foods - for example, yoghurt rather than butter - or avoiding sweetened dairy products that are loaded with added sugar,  he said. Combining these results with 17 other studies involving a total of almost 43,000 people from the US, Denmark, and the UK confirmed these findings in other populations.  While the findings may be partly influenced by factors other than dairy fat, our study does not suggest any harm of dairy fat per se,  Dr Marklund said. Lead author Dr Kathy Trieu from The George Institute for Global Health said that consumption of some dairy foods, especially fermented products, have previously been associated with benefits for the heart.  Increasing evidence suggests that the health impact of dairy foods may be more dependent on the type - such as cheese, yoghurt, milk, and butter - rather than the fat content, which has raised doubts if avoidance of dairy fats overall is beneficial for cardiovascular health,  she said.  Our study suggests that cutting down on dairy fat or avoiding dairy altogether might not be the best choice for heart health.   It is important to remember that although dairy foods can be rich in saturated fat, they are also rich in many other nutrients and can be a part of a healthy diet. However, other fats like those found in seafood, nuts, and non-tropical vegetable oils can have greater health benefits than dairy fats,  Dr Trieu added.ReferenceTrieu K et al.

Currently, this research is conducted on surplus embryos willingly donated by individuals who have undergone in vitro fertilization. Nevertheless, this research is limited by the availability of embryos and strict international ethical time limits on how long an embryo is allowed to develop in the laboratory (14 days maximum).Now, Caltech researchers have created embryo-like structures out of human stem cells. In contrast to natural embryos that are formed by a combination of sperm and egg, these structures are formed by combining so-called pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to develop into specialized types of cells. Though these embryo-like structures have some key differences from real embryos, the technology to create them will be critical in answering open questions about human development without the need for donated embryos.The research was conducted in the laboratory of Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, Bren Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering at Caltech, and is described in a paper appearing in the journal Nature Communications on September 21.The structures are made from a type of pluripotent stem cell that gives rise to distinct types of cells that then self-assemble into a structure with morphology clearly reminiscent of that of an embryo, which has distinct embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. The pluripotent stem cells were initially isolated from a real human embryo by other researchers and have since been maintained in a laboratory environment. Remarkably, the cells can still ""remember"" how to assemble into an embryo when supported by the right environmental conditions.""The ability to assemble the basic structure of the embryo seems to be a built-in property of these earliest embryonic cells that they are simply unable to 'forget,'"" says Zernicka-Goetz. ""Nevertheless, either their memory is not absolutely precise or we don't yet have the best method of helping the cells recover their memories. We still have further work to do before we can get human stem cells to achieve the developmental accuracy that is possible with their equivalent mouse stem cell counterparts.""The ability to generate embryo-like structures from stem cells means that additional donated embryos are not needed; in addition, the structures can be created in large quantities. Thus, this model system may lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of early embryonic development that are not constrained by the limited availability of human embryos. For example, it will be possible to perturb particular genes and study the resulting impact on the developmental process. Additionally, this system can be used to understand how different cellular components coordinate their development at very early stages and the impact of this cellular cross-talk upon later developmental stages.Reference: Sozen B, Jorgensen V, Weatherbee BAT, Chen S, Zhu M, Zernicka-Goetz M.

Investigators have determined that HR-HPV DNA can be detected in saliva in most patients with HPV-driven OPC at the time of diagnosis. This work highlights a potentially life-saving screening program based on salivary HR-HPV DNA testing for early cancer detection and patient monitoring. Their findings appear in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, published by Elsevier.  Despite the upsurge in HPV-driven HNC, there are no early detection methods or screening strategies for this cancer type, unlike cervical cancer, which is caused by the same virus. Biomarkers enabling early detection, monitoring and disease prognostication are warranted to combat the rising incidence of HPV-driven OPC,  observed lead investigator Chamindie Punyadeera, PhD, head, Saliva & Liquid Biopsy Translational Laboratory, School of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), and Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.Dr. Punyadeera and her colleagues investigated the efficacy of salivary HPV detection as a biomarker of HPV-HNC and survival patterns in patients with OPC to evaluate the utility of salivary HR-HPV as a prognostic biomarker for OPC.Saliva testing was performed on 491 patients at the time of first diagnosis of HNC and 10 patients with recurring HNC. Forty-three percent were positive for salivary HR-HPV DNA. HPV16, a high-risk strain of the virus, was detected in 92% of the HPV-positive saliva samples. The vast majority of HPV-HNC had arisen from the oropharynx, especially from the palatine tonsils and the base of the tongue, confirming that the oropharynx is the hotspot for these cancers. Seventy-two percent of OPC patients were positive for HR-HPV DNA in their saliva, and tumor p16 overexpression was observed in 89.3%. These findings support the utility of saliva testing as a biomarker for facilitating early detection and screening of HR-HPV DNA. Two hundred and fifteen patients with OPC were followed for up to five years. Salivary HR-HPV positive patients had a clear survival advantage over their salivary HR-HPV negative counterparts. The median event-free survivals were 205 months for HR-HPV positive patients, compared to 82 months for HR-HPV negative patients. Although the number of patients with recurrent cancer in the study was small, findings indicate that salivary HR-HPV tends to be positive in the majority of patients at the locoregional point of occurrence. When the noninvasive nature and convenience of the collection are considered, salivary HR-HPV testing is an ideal mode of screening asymptomatic individuals and the long-term monitoring of HPV-driven HNC patients. Our findings indicate that in the near future, salivary HR-HPV testing will become part of routine clinical management for HPV-driven OPC patients,  noted Dr. Punyadeera. Liquid biopsy in HNC has the potential to be truly transformative,  explained co-investigator Sarju Vasani, MD, Royal Brisbane and Women s Hospital; and the Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.  It has the potential to personalize treatment selection and aid in assessing disease prognosis. It can help us select patients for adjuvant treatment and will alert us to recurrence before imaging or clinical examination has detected any specific abnormality. It is only a matter of time before these biomarkers translate from research settings to clinical practice. In some countries, including the United States, HNC and particularly OPC, have surpassed cervical cancers as the most common HPV-driven cancer. Patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. In the early stages, these cancers are difficult to locate with imaging studies or physical examination. The oropharynx is difficult to access, and detection is further complicated if these smaller lesions are hidden in the crevices of the tonsils. These cancers can metastasize at an early stage, even when the primary cancer is still undetectable in size.Reference: Ekanayake Weeramange C, Liu Z, Hartel G, et al.

Researchers from Lancaster University Management School, the Norwegian University Science and Technology and Trinity College Dublin examined the cognitive function of more than 2,000 retired people from across Europe, and found that post-retirement internet usage is associated with substantially higher scores on tests. The study, published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, uses data drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) that collects information about the health, employment history and socio-economic status of older people. Focusing on a sample of 2,105 older people from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland who have been retired since 2004, researchers examined retirees  cognitive function in both 2013 and 2015. They specifically focused on a word recall test, where individuals were asked to recall a list of 10 words immediately, and then again five minutes later.Results found that, on average, people who used the internet after they retired were able to recall 1.22 extra words in the recall test compared to non-internet users. However, retirees who used the internet were also more likely to be male, younger, better educated, and have been retired for a shorter period. They also appear to be in better health   even though they drink and smoke more.Dr Vincent O Sullivan, a co-author from Lancaster University Management School said:  Our results reveal that using the internet, post-retirement, leads to a marked reduction in the rate of cognitive decline. Interestingly, this protective effect was found to be most significant amongst women, with female retirees who regularly surfed the internet able to recall 2.37 more words compared to women who didn t go online. The results were also consistent among men, with retired internet users able to recall 0.94 more words than men with similar characteristics who didn t use the internet. We also found that retirees who used computers in their jobs before retirement were more likely to keep using computers once they retired, and hence had better cognitive function. Researchers compared the cognitive function of retirees who used to work in jobs where computers were commonplace to retirees who worked in jobs where computers weren t often used. For example, among teachers, computers became common in the workplace much later than sectors such as financial services. Their results revealed that people with pre-retirement exposure to computers were more likely to continue to use them once they retired.Among the overall results, the researchers also found a stark difference in the patterns of internet usage between European countries, with no more than 12% of retirees using the internet in Italy, compared to over 60% in Denmark. Research has shown that retirement from the workforce is a critical period for cognitive function, which declines with age and can be a predictor for a range of key health outcomes among older people,  said co-author Likun Mao, formerly a PhD student at Lancaster but now at Trinity College Dublin.  Although there is a widespread belief that computer usage improves older people s cognitive function   such as memory, attention, spatial abilities and problem solving   there has been mixed evidence from previous studies.  We were able to discern that pre-retirement computer usage does not directly influence post-retirement cognitive decline, and we ensured our results referred only to post-retirement internet usage.  Professor Colin Green, of the Norwegian University Science and Technology, added:  Within our study we estimated statistical models which controlled for individuals  ages, education levels, occupational skills and years since retirement, so we are confident that our results are robust and relate only to the use of the internet, post retirement. This sets it apart from other studies and raises the interesting question of what it is about internet use exactly, that drives this positive effect on cognitive function. Interacting with others online, finding out information in order to attend social activities or simple tasks like shopping online can all make life easier for retirees, but we are yet to understand which, if any, of these tasks actually go as far as improving cognitive performance.

The findings were published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.The researchers looked at retrospective data of 1,961 diabetic patients who were new users of this class of drugs and matched them to 4,371 unexposed control subjects. After 150 days on average, 10 patients in the medicated group were newly diagnosed with glaucoma (0.5 percent) compared to 58 patients (1.3 percent) in the control group. The findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may decrease a diabetic patient s risk of developing glaucoma by half.The findings are supported by a Penn Medicine study from 2020, which found that GLP-1R agonists reduced neuroinflammation and prevented retinal ganglion cell death in mice. This class of drugs has also shown similarly protective effects against Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases in animal models, and clinical trials are underway to test the medications against neurodegenerative diseases in humans.Glaucoma affects 3 million Americans and is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. People with diabetes are twice as likely to develop the eye condition. It was very encouraging to see that a popular diabetes medication could significantly reduce the risk of developing glaucoma, and our study suggests that these medications warrant further study in this patient population,  says Qi N.

The enzyme, called Cas7-11, modifies RNA targets without harming cells, suggesting that in addition to being a valuable research tool, it provides a fertile platform for therapeutic applications. This new enzyme is like the Cas9 of RNA,  says McGovern Fellow Omar Abudayyeh, referring to the DNA-cutting CRISPR enzyme that has revolutionized modern biology by making DNA editing fast, inexpensive, and exact.  It creates two precise cuts and doesn't destroy the cell in the process, like other enzymes,  he adds.Up until now, only one other family of RNA-targeting enzymes, Cas13, has extensively been developed for RNA targeting applications. However, when Cas13 recognizes its target, it shreds any RNAs in the cell, destroying the cell along the way. Like Cas9, Cas7-11 is part of a programmable system; it can be directed at specific RNA targets using a CRISPR guide. Abudayyeh, McGovern Fellow Jonathan Gootenberg, and their colleagues discovered Cas7-11 through a deep exploration of the CRISPR systems found in the microbial world. Their findings were recently reported in the journal Nature.","Published: September 21, 2021"

However, those antibodies don t bind well to newer variants, a new study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found.Characterizing what kinds of antibodies the body is most likely to make to fight a natural infection is an important roadmap for vaccine design, says study leader Nicholas Wu, an Illinois professor of biochemistry. His research team published its findings in the journal Nature Communications. Antibody response is quite relevant to everything from understanding natural infection and how we recover from infection to vaccine design. The body has the capability to produce diverse antibody responses   it s estimated we could make a trillion different antibodies. So when you see people are making quite similar antibodies to a particular virus, we call it convergent antibody response,  Wu said.  That means we can design vaccines trying to elicit this kind of antibody response, and that is probably going to improve the responsiveness of more individuals to the vaccine. The researchers mined published papers about COVID-19 patients for data about the sequence of the antibodies they produced. They focused on antibodies against the spike protein, the part of the virus that binds to receptors on human cells to infect them. The spike protein is the target of most vaccines.They found that many antibody sequences converged into two main groups, indicating a consistent human immune response to the virus, said graduate student Timothy Tan, the first author of the study. We really focused on characterizing the antibodies created in those infected with the original strain of the virus,  Tan said.  Before we started the study, variants weren t much of a problem. As they emerged, we wanted to see whether the common antibodies we identified were able to bind to newer variants. The researchers studied the convergent antibodies  ability to bind to several variants and found that they no longer bound to some. The finding has implications for the ability of new variants to reinfect people who contracted earlier versions of the virus, as well as for the continuing efficacy of vaccines and the design of possible vaccine boosters, Wu said. Even though this antibody response is very common with the original strain, it doesn t really interact with variants,  Wu said.  That, of course, raises the concern of the virus evolving to escape the body s main antibody response. Some antibodies should still be effective   the body makes antibodies to many parts of the virus, not only the spike protein   but the particular groups of antibodies that we saw in this study will not be as effective. The researchers said they would like to conduct similar studies characterizing antibody responses to delta and other variants, to see whether they also produce a convergent response and how it differs from the original strain. We want to design vaccines and boosters, if needed, that can protect a majority of the population,  Tan said.  We expect that the antibody response to those variants would be quite different. When we have more data about the antibodies of patients who have been infected with variants, understanding the difference in the immune response is one of the directions that we would like to pursue.

The drug had more effect in the 31 patients with left-sided/rectal tumours, increasing overall survival   that is, patients lived longer.The researchers caution that these are early results and that larger trials are needed to establish whether the drug improves survival compared to standard treatment. The trial tested adavosertib among patients who were on a treatment break following chemotherapy, but the drug could potentially benefit patients with other types of bowel cancer or alongside standard treatments in other lines of therapy.The subset of patients who took part in the trial had tumours with two common mutations, RAS and TP53, that the researchers hypothesised would make the tumours more sensitive to the effects of the drug. About a third of all colorectal cancer patients have tumours with these two mutations.

With a multitude of studies supporting similar conclusions still to be presented (tomorrow), new research revealed today that individuals with cancer have an appropriate, protective immune response to vaccination without experiencing any more side-effects than the general population. Indirect evidence suggests that a third  booster  shot could further increase the level of protection among this patient population.  As patients with cancer were excluded from the clinical trials conducted to develop the vaccines and support their authorisation for use, the questions of whether the vaccines are safe in this vulnerable population and whether they provide adequate protection against severe forms of COVID-19 to individuals whose immune system may be weakened by various anticancer medicines had until now been left open.   The ESMO annual congress, held for the second time in a virtual format this year in an extra effort to protect our colleagues, has devoted significant efforts to making COVID-19 a priority,  said ESMO Chief Medical Officer George Pentheroudakis.

In a paper published in the British Medical Journal, they write that by updating the QCovid tool developed in 2020, which directly influenced UK policy in February 2021, adding 1.5 million people in February 2021 to list of those advised to shield, they are able to identify groups more at risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19.They used national linked datasets from general practice, national immunisation and SARS-CoV-2 testing, death registry and hospital episode data, in order to analyse a sample of over 6.9m vaccinated adults, of whom 5.2m had both vaccines doses, which was representative of the UK population as a whole. This sample included 2,031 Covid-19 deaths and 1,929 Covid-19 related hospital admissions, of which 81 deaths and 71 admissions occurred 14 or more days after the second vaccine dose. Based on this, the researchers have developed cumulative risk scores to calculate people s risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19 following one, or two vaccination doses. These scores take into account factors including age, sex, ethnic group and the background rate of Covid infections, and in particular highlight an elevated risk to: Julia Hippisley-Cox, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and General Practice at the University of Oxford, co-author of the paper, said: The UK was the first place to implement a vaccination programme and has some of the best clinical research data in the world. We have developed this new tool using the QResearch database, to help the NHS identify which patients are at highest risk of serious outcomes despite vaccination for targeted intervention. This new tool can also inform discussions between doctors and patients about the level of risk to aid shared decision making. The researchers report that there were relatively few COVID-19 related hospitalisations or deaths in the group who had received the second dose of any vaccine, meaning that the study lacked the statistical power to determine if the groups listed above are more, or less, at risk following a second vaccine dose compared with following the first dose.Furthermore, they did not distinguish between type of vaccination offered, and acknowledge that their study may have been limited by factors such as exposure, as occupation for example is not something that is often recorded in general practice or hospital records.Aziz Sheikh, Professor of Primary Care Research & Development and Director of the Usher Institute at The University of Edinburgh and a co-author of the paper, said: This enormous national study of over 5 million people vaccinated with 2 doses across the UK has found that a small minority of people remain at risk of Covid-19 hospitalisation and death.  Our risk calculator helps to identify those who remain most at risk post-vaccination.  'Our new QCovid tool, developed with the help of experts from across the UK, has been designed to identify those at high risk who may benefit from interventions such as vaccine booster doses or new treatments such as monoclonal antibodies, which can help reduce the risk of progression SARS-CoV-2 infection to serious Covid-19 outcomes.  The researchers hope that these data can be used in a variety of health and care settings to inform those more likely to be at risk, and potentially help to prioritise those identified for further trials of vaccines, boosters or future preventative therapies. Prof. Hippisley-Cox concludes: Individual risk will always depend on individual choices as well as the current prevalence of the disease, however we hope that this new tool will help shared decision making and more personalised risk assessment.

It involves participants looking at a series of flashing images on a computer over two minutes, whilst their brain waves are measured using an EEG cap.Published in the journal BRAIN, the research shows that the technique is highly effective at picking up small, subtle changes in brain waves which occur when a person remembers an image. Crucially, the technique is completely passive, meaning the person doing the test doesn t need to understand the task or respond, and may not even be aware of their memory response.The team behind the  Fastball EEG  technology says the approach is cheap, portable and relies on pre-existing technology already available in hospitals, making it easily scalable. They are now beginning to use Fastball EEG in a study of the earliest stages of Alzheimer s disease in collaboration with the Research Institute for the Care of Older People (RICE) and the Bristol Brain Centre at Southmead Hospital.Alzheimer s is the underlying cause of approximately 60% of dementia, with an estimated prevalence rate in Europe and North America of 5-7% of the population. Estimates suggest the disease costs the UK economy around  26 billion a year, with costs expected to rise as an ageing population will see numbers increasing.Alzheimer s disease is currently diagnosed using a combination of subjective and objective reports of cognitive decline, often involving memory tests administered in a clinic. These tests are prone to various biases, including assessment anxiety, but also require verbal and written communication abilities which make them ineffective for certain people.By knowing more about people s disease at an earlier stage drugs can be prescribed earlier when they may be more effective, such as the recently approved Aducanumab, the first disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer s disease. Lifestyle interventions can also be implemented to help slow disease progression. Current diagnosis for Alzheimer s typically occurs late in the progression of the disease.In the near future, the researchers hope that Fastball EEG could help lower the age of diagnosis by up to five years. Longer-term, they say it may offer opportunities to expand this further. They liken their future aspirations for its application to current screening tools used to test for high blood pressure in middle age.Lead researcher and cognitive neuroscientist Dr George Stothart of the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath explains:  Fastball offers a genuinely novel way of measuring how our brain is functioning. The person being assessed doesn t need to understand the test, or even respond, they simply watch a screen of flashing images and by the way we manipulate the images that appear we can learn an enormous amount about what their brain is, or is not, able to do. The tests we currently use to diagnose Alzheimer s miss the first 20 years of the disease, which means we are missing huge opportunities to help people. For decades now we have had tools in scientific research that have been able to probe how the brain is working, but we have never made the leap to a viable clinical tool for the objective assessment of cognition. We hope that Fastball may be that leap. We are at a really exciting stage in its development. We are testing the tool in earlier and earlier stages of Alzheimer s and expanding the type of brain function it can measure, to include language and visual processing. This will help us to not only understand Alzheimer s but also the many other less common forms of dementia. Ultimately the Holy Grail of a tool like this would be a dementia screening tool used in middle age for everyone, regardless of symptoms, in the same way we test for high blood pressure. We are a long way from that, but this is a step towards that goal. Mark Poarch, chief executive of BRACE Dementia Research, added:  We were delighted to be able to fund Dr Stothart s research, which clearly has exciting potential. It could result in an early diagnostic tool with benefit for innumerable people and help turn the tide against dementia. More generally, we have seen in the last year what happens when the world ploughs resources into medical research to find a vaccine for a dangerous virus, and we now need to give dementia researchers the resources they need to achieve comparable breakthroughs. Dr Stothart and colleagues will soon start work on a significant  100,000 longitudinal study of early dementia funded by the Academy of Medical Sciences. The study will involve testing patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment using the new Fastball tool. Mild Cognitive Impairment is for some patients the first signs of Alzheimer s, but crucially for many it is not, and determining who is going to progress to Alzheimer s could move diagnosis earlier by up to five years.Reference: Stothart G, Smith LJ, Milton A, Coulthard E.

The research team used observations of these winds over the 20th century to better represent their variability in climate model predictions of the future. They found that this made the predictions of future climate less certain in the extratropics   particularly in the North Atlantic region and particularly in winter   and that unusually hot, cold, wet or dry decades are projected to be much more likely by the middle of the century in this region than existing climate simulations suggest. Dr Christopher O Reilly, a Royal Society University Research Fellow in the University of Reading s Department of Meteorology, said:  Variations between decades in the strength of winds in the more temperate regions of the world are a crucial missing ingredient in projections of the future climate of those regions.  By adding this extra variability into climate models, we showed that these winds may be an additional source of uncertainty on top of climate change. This could mean that within these regions,  temperatures are pushed to relatively extreme highs or lows more often. While in some decades they could counteract increases to temperatures and heavy rainfall caused by climate change, in other periods they could make these extremes even more extreme.  This is yet another reminder that preparation will be crucial as we face up to more variable regional climates as an impact of climate change in the future.  The team used wind observation data from the Met Office, Copernicus Climate Data Store and NOAA, among others, to carry out their analysis and bolster the climate model predictions. The range of temperature and rainfall most likely to occur in future decades increased by 50% across Northern Europe, Northern America and the Mediterranean   with uncertainty nearly doubling in some cases. This strengthens previous research that suggests rainfall and temperatures that are very unlikely today will fall within the likely range in future due to climate change. The updated projections showed that the Mediterranean would see a higher frequency of drier-than-average winters. As studies show that dry winters in this region make heatwaves in Europe more common the following summer, this has health and infrastructure implications for several countries.ReferenceO Reilly CH, Befort DJ, Weisheimer A, Woollings T, Ballinger A, Hegerl G.

The app has already shown itself to be effective in a clinical trial, with subjects experiencing less fear of real spiders after completing just a few training units with the app at home.Fear of spiders is one of the most common phobias and leads to a variety of limitations in everyday life, as those affected seek to avoid situations involving spiders. For example, sufferers are known to avoid social occasions outdoors, visits to the zoo or certain travel destinations   or to excessively check rooms for spiders or avoid certain rooms, such as basements or lofts, altogether. One effective treatment for a fear of spiders is  exposure therapy,  in which patients are guided through therapeutic exposure to the situations they fear in order to gradually break down their phobia. This treatment is rarely used, however, because those affected are reluctant to expose themselves to real spiders.To remedy this situation, the interdisciplinary research team led by Professor Dominique de Quervain has developed a smartphone-based augmented reality app called Phobys. Writing in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders, the researchers have reported promising results with this app designed to tackle the fear of spiders.Phobys is based on exposure therapy and uses a realistic 3D spider model that is projected into the real world.  It s easier for people with a fear of spiders to face a virtual spider than a real one,  explains Anja Zimmer, lead author of the study.

The finding, published this week in PNAS, could offer an unexpected new target to fight this condition.Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a form of eczema. AD affects up to 13% of children and 10% of adults, with an annual treatment cost of $5.3 billion in the U.S. alone. We often think of eczema as a dry-skin condition and treat mild cases with moisturizers,  said corresponding author Tamia Harris-Tryon, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Dermatology and Immunology at UTSW.  Here, we re showing that a gene that s important for making sex hormones seems to play a role in the skin making its own moisturizers. If we could alter this gene s activity, we could potentially provide relief to eczema patients by helping the skin make more oils and lipids to moisturize itself. Dr. Harris-Tryon explained that previous research has linked AD to overactivity in genes responsible for the production of two inflammatory immune molecules, interleukins 4 and 13 (IL-4 and IL-13). A relatively new drug called dupilumab   a monoclonal antibody that reduces the amount of the inflammatory molecules   has been extremely effective in many patients with moderate to severe AD. However, the molecular mechanisms behind how IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to this form of eczema was unknown.To investigate this question, Dr. Harris-Tryon and her colleagues focused on sebocytes, the cells that make up sebaceous glands. These glands produce an oily, waxy barrier that coats the skin, helping it retain moisture.The researchers dosed human sebocytes growing in petri dishes with IL-4 and IL-13, then used a technique called RNA sequencing to get a readout on gene activity for the entire genome and compared it with gene activity in sebocytes that weren t treated with these immune molecules. They found that a gene called HSD3B1, which makes an enzyme called 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, became up to 60 times more active when exposed to the two interleukins.The finding was a surprise, Dr. Harris-Tryon said, because this enzyme is well known for playing a key role in the production of sex hormones such as testosterone and progesterone, but it had never been linked to atopic dermatitis and skin lipid production. Databases of human gene activity showed that HSD3B1 tends to be overactive in patients with eczema; a single study of patients on dupilumab showed that this drug appears to lower HSD3B1 s activity. Both pieces of evidence suggest that IL-4 and IL-13 drive up the activity of this gene.To determine how this gene affects sebum output, the researchers manipulated HSD3B1 s activity in sebocytes growing in petri dishes. They found that when they made this gene less active, the levels of sex hormones decreased, and skin sebum production increased. The reverse was also true, with more gene activity leading to higher amounts of sex hormones and less sebum. The researchers made similar findings in a mouse model of AD, with sex hormone production decreasing the production of skin lipids.Together, Dr. Harris-Tryon said, these findings suggest that HSD3B1 could be a new target for fighting AD and potentially other forms of eczema.  Changing the output of this gene could eventually offer a way to treat AD that s completely different from any treatment that currently exists,  she added.Other UTSW researchers who contributed to this study include Chenlu Zhang, Mahendran Chinnappan, Courtney A.

Transport proteins have an important role to play in this process. In an article published in the journal Nature Communications, a German/UK research team led by Heinrich Heine University D sseldorf (HHU) has now described the three-dimensional structure of transport protein Pdr5, found also in a similar form in pathogenic fungi. The results could help develop mechanisms to combat dangerous pathogens.Micro-organism resistance to antibiotics in particular is a major problem in everyday medicine. This has seen the number of resistant microbes increase exponentially. As a result, infections that appeared to already have been eradicated using modern drugs now once again pose a potentially fatal threat to humans. The situation is further complicated by the fact that more and more germs are emerging which are resistant to not one but several antibiotics or other drugs. Research is under way into the mechanisms used by microbes to defend themselves against substances toxic to them. One method is to actively transport the toxic substances out of the cell before they can cause any damage. The microbes use special membrane transport proteins for this purpose. In particular in eukaryotic microbes such as fungi that have a cell nucleus   unlike bacteria, which have none   these membrane proteins are part of the family of ABC transporters ( ATP-binding cassette ). They export the toxic substances by splitting the cellular ATP energy transporter. In a current publication in Nature Communications, a German/UK research team headed up by Prof. Dr. Lutz Schmitt from the Institute of Biochemistry at HHU has presented the three-dimensional structure of yeast ABC transporter Pdr5 in several functional states. They determined these structures using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, which makes it possible to examine in particular biological molecules in their natural form at very high resolutions by flash-freezing them to low temperatures. Not only did the research team show that Pdr5 is a central transport protein in creating the resistance conferred by the membrane protein, it also used solved structures to localise the drug-binding site and define the transport cycle. For more than 30 years, Pdr5 has constituted the model for PDR proteins in pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans, which causes Candidiasis. The new findings help to explain what it is at molecular level that enables a single membrane protein to prevent structurally diverse molecules from entering the cell or transport them out of the cell efficiently. The findings can now be used as a basis for designing new drugs in a targeted way to counteract resistance.ReferenceHarris A., Wagner M, Du D et al.

Most famously, late blight of potato resulted in the Great Irish Famine. Blight continues today, affecting crops around the world. One form of bacterial blight (caused by Pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis or Pcal) affects cruciferous plants, such as cabbage, as well as green manure crops like oats.Pcal is known to use virulence factors, but these factors have not been investigated until recently, when scientists from the University of Tsukuba in Japan conducted research into coronatine (COR) function, one of the pathogen s well-known virulence factors. A phytotoxin, COR is known to aid pathogen growth and lesion formation or expansion by reopening stomata, which makes the plant more vulnerable, but its exact role in Pcal infection was unknown.Investigating the interaction between Pcal and cabbage and oats, the University of Tsukuba scientists found that COR does reopen the stomata but that it also suppresses salicylic acid, which plants use to protect themselves from pathogens. Through these actions, COR helps Pcal successfully infect the plant, leading to bacterial blight. Because of the unique Pcal characteristics, which can infect both dicot and monocot plants, we were able to investigate COR functions in the interactions between the pathogen and two very different plants: cabbage and oat,  explained scientist Nanami Sakata, who hopes that this research can be used to develop bacterial pathogens protection methods or chemicals that target pathogen infection processes.  We believe that the reveal of this virulence mechanism can lead to the development of new disease control strategies. Reference: Sakata N, Ishiga T, Masuo S, Hashimoto Y, Ishiga Y.

Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering and doctoral student Xiang Zhao detail a framework incorporating several mathematical models and methodologies that factor everything from chemical recycling equipment, processes and energy sources, to environmental effects and the market for end products.The framework is the first comprehensive analysis of its kind that quantifies the life-cycle environmental impacts of plastic waste chemical recycling, such as climate change and human toxicity.Billions of tons of plastic have been produced since the 1950s, yet most of it   91%, according to one often cited study   has not been recycled. While growing landfills and contaminated natural areas are among the concerns, the failure to reduce and reuse plastic is also seen by some as a missed economic opportunity.That s why the emerging industry of chemical recycling is capturing the attention of the waste industry and researchers like You, who is helping to identify optimal technologies for chemical recycling and providing a roadmap for the future of the industry.Not only does chemical recycling create a  circular economy,  in which a waste product can be turned back into a natural resource, but it opens the door for plastics such as high-density polyethylene   used to produce items such as rigid bottles, toys, underground pipes, and mail package envelopes   to be recycled more commonly.You s framework can quantify the environmental consequences of market dynamics that typical life-cycle sustainability assessments would overlook. It s also the first to combine superstructure optimization   a computational technique for searching over a large combinatorial space of technology pathways for minimizing cost   with life-cycle analysis, market information and economic equilibrium.The paper highlights the benefits of consequential life-cycle optimization when compared with more traditional analytical tools. In one scenario, to maximize economic outcomes while minimizing environmental impacts, life-cycle optimization produced a more than 14% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and a more than 60% reduction of photochemical air pollution when compared with the attributional life-cycle assessment approach typically used in environmental assessment studies.While the analysis gives industry experts and policy makers a general pathway for advancing chemical recycling and a circular economy for plastics, a myriad of choices and variables along the technological path must be considered. For instance, if the market demand for basic chemicals like ethylene and propylene is strong enough, the framework recommends a specific type of chemical separation technology, while if butane or isobutene are desired, another type technology is optimal. It s a chemical process and there are so many possibilities,  You said.  If we want to invest in chemical recycling, what technology would we use? That really depends on the composition of our waste, the variants of polyethylene plastic, and it depends on current market prices for end products like fuels and hydrocarbons. Environmental consequences of chemical recycling depend on variables such as supplier process of chemical feedstocks and products. For instance, the framework found that producing butene onsite as opposed to having it supplied can reduce photochemical air pollution from recycling plants by nearly 20%, while onsite use of natural gas increases more than 37% of potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There s always something we can twist and adjust in the technology and process, and that s the tricky part,  said You, who added that as new chemical recycling techniques emerge and markets change, consequential life-cycle optimization will remain a powerful tool for guiding the emerging industry.Reference: Zhao X, You F.

Like a good housekeeper who saves as much as she can, she knows how to avoid what is too much and too little.One of the best examples of this thrifty behaviour of Nature is the evolution of ruminants: animals such as deer, goats, cows and antelope have developed a unique digestive system, consisting of four different stomachs, to convert even the toughest grasses and leaves into nourishing milk, wool and protein. Remember, as a child, how one cringed at the idea of regurgitating your own food to chew on it before it being swallowed again? Well, cows spend about eight hours of their day doing exactly that, thereby assisting their microbial community to process the raw plant food. A cow is therefore a natural example of consolidated bioprocessing where cellulose (in plantmaterial) is hydrolysed and converted to various products in a single vessel (the cow). So what can we learn from Nature, and more specifically cows, when dealing with the 83 million metric tons of agricultural, municipal and fruit waste produced in South Africa every year? According to microbiologists at Stellenbosch University, the concept of a biorefinery based on the four-stomach digestive system of ruminants, may just be key to the establishment of simple and robust, small-scale biorefinery operations in South Africa and Africa. Prof Emile van Zyl, distinguished professor in microbiology at SU, says first-world countries have made significant progress over the last few decades in the development of capital-intensive and advanced technologies to produce bioethanol from plant material. Yet, as long as relatively cheap fossil fuels are around, the upscaling of these technologies remain commercially non-viable.  South Africa and Africa cannot afford the huge capital costs of large-scale cellulosic ethanol plants and the technological challenges associated with it,"" he explains. That is why, in a recent review published in the journal Catalysis, they propose the introduction of the rumen microbiome into anaerobic digestion processes. Currently, mixed anaerobic microbial cultures are used to break down organic matter to generate mostly biogas, and much research is aimed at finding the most efficient microbes and identifying the parameters for their optimal functioning.  Yet, argue the researchers, mammalian ruminants have naturally evolved to perform anaerobic digestion of plant material. Furthermore, instead of producing biogas, they suggest supressing that latter part of the digestion process and rather use microbial hosts to produce industrial important organic acids, such as acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric and caproic acids from agricultural wastes. Yeast biotechnology can also be employed for the conversion of malic acid in grape and apple pomace to higher-value lactic, citric, fumaric and succinic acids. For example, the current value of organic acids can vary from about US$600 per metric ton for acetic acid to more than US$2000 per metric ton for carbon 4-6 carboxylic acids. With the rise in demand for bioplastics, organic polymers such as polylactate reach values of more than US$3500 per metric ton. Prof Marinda Viljoen-Bloom, one of the co-authors, says while the application of rumen microbes for the digestion of plant material is not a new concept, it remains a challenge to replicate the complicated interactions found in ruminants in a bioreactor. In the Biofuels Research Group at the Department of Microbiology, they are specifically looking at ways to add value to South African waste streams: For his PhD, Dr Sesethu Njokweni explored the anaerobic production of volatile fatty acids from agricultural waste, while PhD student Annica Steyn is constructing a recombinant yeast strain that can effectively convert malic acid to higher-value organic acids. Did you know? The most significant sources of organic waste in South Africa is sugarcane bagasse (5.35 million metric tonnes), invasive plants (11.30 million metric tonnes) and fruit wastes (1.3 billion metric tonnes). Microbiologists from Stellenbosch University are investigation the use of mammalian rumen in the anaerobic digestive process to break down or separate organic waste into its original building blocks, from where it can subsequently be converted into various high-value products   just as a cow does with processing the tough plant material into the basic building blocks upon which the production of milk is based.ReferenceNjokweni SG, Steyn A, Botes M, Viljoen-Bloom M, van Zyl WH.

Currently, the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion, as there are no diagnostic tests specific to AA to differentiate it from other disorders, including inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs), which share similar symptoms. However, the process of excluding other diagnoses takes several weeks and can delay treatment, highlighting the need for a fast and accurate diagnostic test specific to the disorder.Researchers at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) hypothesized that AA could be distinguished from IBMFSs using three laboratory findings specific to the autoimmune pathogenesis of AA: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clones, copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity in chromosome arm 6p (6p CN-LOH), and clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma gene (TRG) rearrangement.To test their hypothesis, the researchers analyzed lab samples from 454 pediatric and adult patients with AA, IBMFSs, and other hematologic diseases. They found that PNH and acquired 6p CN-LOH clones encompassing HLA genes have 100% positive predictive value for AA and can facilitate diagnosis in approximately half of AA patients. Conversely, they found that clonal TRG rearrangement is not specific for AA. Our analysis demonstrates that PNH and 6p CN-LOH clones effectively distinguish AA from IBMFSs, and both measures should be incorporated early in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected AA,  said senior study author Daria V. Babushok, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist in the Comprehensive Bone Marrow Failure Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.  The next frontier in BMF diagnostics will include combining these two assays with more sophisticated T-cell analyses and faster, more comprehensive somatic and germline genetic studies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis of acquired and inherited BMF disorders.

Because of its lack of symptoms and dearth of reliable and effective methods for screening and early detection, the vast majority of patients are diagnosed at a late stage when surgery isn't possible, leading to an extremely poor prognosis. The five-year overall survival rate is less than 10%, says Hruban, and the median survival in patients with metastatic disease is less than 12 months.Although numerous studies have examined the genes of pancreatic tumors and identified several mutations linked to this disease, adds Zhang, these mutations cannot be targeted with drug therapies. In addition, these tumors don't attract a significant response from the immune system, so immunotherapies have not been broadly effective.Searching for new ways to fight pancreatic cancer, Hui Zhang, Ralph Hruban, Daniel W. Chan, Ph.D., director of the clinical chemistry division and professor of pathology, postdoctoral researcher Liwei Cao, Ph.D., and collaborators from Johns Hopkins as well as other institutions around the globe took a new look at pancreatic tumors from several different angles. They compared 140 tumor samples with 67 samples of normal adjacent pancreatic tissue from the same patients, and with nine samples of pancreatic tissue from patients who did not have cancer. The team looked at the whole genome, DNA coding sequences, modifications to DNA that turn certain genes on or off, messenger RNA molecules to which the information in the DNA is transferred, and micro RNAs that regulate gene expression. They took an accounting of proteins produced in pancreatic cancer cells, including various modifications to these proteins, such as adding phosphate groups or sugar molecules that can change their function.The team confirmed that pancreatic tumors are more likely to have mutations in several genes identified in previous studies, including KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A and SMAD4. In addition, they identified 222 proteins with at least a twofold increase in abundance between pancreatic cancerous cells and normal cells; nearly 5,000 sites in these proteins with increased phosphorylation abundance patterns; and more than 1,700 sites with an increase in attached carbohydrates, or glycosylation.Several of these glycosylated proteins are secreted from pancreatic cancer cells, Zhang says, suggesting they could potentially be captured in the blood for early diagnosis. In addition, PAK1 and PAK2 two specialized proteins, called kinases, that place phosphate groups onto other proteins that are dysregulated in pancreatic cancer could offer previously unrecognized targets to treat this disease. There are several small molecule inhibitors targeting PAK1, offering a potential path toward treating pancreatic tumors, which are still under investigation. Other protein differences between the cancer cells and normal tissue appear to be roadblocks that stymie immune system attack, adds Zhang, suggesting new ways to improve immune response to these tumors.The abundance of data produced in this study could aid the search for new ways to improve pancreatic cancer detection and treatment far into the future, Hruban adds.

They constantly modify their shape and even move through tissue. These vital properties are based on a dynamically organized network of branched actin filaments, which generates pushing forces to move the cell membrane. An interdisciplinary team lead by Peter Bieling and Stefan Raunser from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology (MPI) in Dortmund has now jointly revealed a previously unknown mechanism, explaining how stopping the growth of older actin filaments within the network promotes the formation of new ones, thereby maintaining the structure and function of the cytoskeleton, much like proper pruning of hedges in the garden.Cells grow, divide, change their shape and move. They provide structure for the body and tissues, enter wounds to close them or chase down bacteria in our blood. The mobility of cells is a prerequisite for a variety of essential biological functions and is ensured by the cytoskeleton. This dynamic protein network assembles on the inside of the cell membrane and is responsible for the cell s shape, its mechanical stability and it s ability to move.How tiny molecules assemble into large powerful structuresOne key component of the cytoskeleton is actin, which can self-assemble into filaments. But where does the pushing force of the cytoskeleton actually originate from? The origin lies in a nucleation process that occurs just beneath the cell membrane. Nucleation of new actin filaments is initiated by a protein complex called Arp2/3, which is activated by membrane-bound nucleation promoting factors (NPF). The Apr2/3 forms the initial seed of a new filament and connects this seed to the side of older filaments. After the initial formation of this actin seed, further actin monomers attach and construct a filament, which grows against the membrane. This growth process generates the pushing force. The resulting structure of the actin network looks like a tree or a hedge, with many connected branches of actin filaments.Trimming the actin hedge promotes the growth of new filamentsTo ensure optimal power transmission to the plasma membrane, the branched actin network requires continuous maintenance. A key player in this process is the capping protein. Its main task is to stop the elongation of filaments before they become too long and to prevent the non-productive elongation of filaments that grow away from the cell membrane. Capping actin filaments thus has a similar effect to trimming a hedge: it keeps the (actin) hedge neat and tidy, much like proper pruning However, it also stimulates the budding production (actin branching) near the plant s edges (membrane) through the Arp2/3 complex. The precise mechanism involved in how the capping protein controls the speed by which Arp2/3 forms new filaments was not previously understood.How a molecular tentacle regulates branchingAn interdisciplinary team of structural biologists and biochemists from the MPI in Dortmund, together with cell biologists from Braunschweig University, has now uncovered the so far enigmatic mechanism behind the opposing function of the capping protein in the branched network assembly. A high-resolution structure of the capping protein bound to an actin filament-end produced by co-first author Felipe Merino using electron cryo-microscopy revealed that the capping protein does much more than previously assumed. It not only stops filament growth, but also blocks the end from interacting with other proteins. Most importantly, it blocks the binding of nucleation promoting factors (the Arp2/3 activators) via a tiny  tentacle  extension. Johanna Funk, co-first author of the study, was able to show, that removing this tentacle did not prevent the capping protein from stopping filament growth, but drastically inhibited the network assembly and the efficiency of lamellipodial protrusion required for cell movement when working together with all other proteins required to build branched networks. Studying the role of the capping protein from many different angles has uncovered details about how the core proteins that build branched actin networks  do not act as separate players as previously thought, but really as a functional unit. We hope, that our findings will contribute to a better understanding of cell movement of both healthy as well as diseased cells in the future,  says Peter Bieling.Reference: Yu J, Raia P, Ghent CM, et al.

In a study of the University of Turku and Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, the researchers observed that already a higher two-hour glucose level in the glucose tolerance test predicts worse performance in a test measuring episodic memory after ten years. Decline in episodic memory is one of the first symptoms of Alzheimer s disease.Diabetes is known to be an independent risk factor for memory disorders. Previous studies have shown that risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and decreased insulin sensitivity are associated with decline in cognitive functions and heightened risk of developing memory disorders. Fasting blood glucose is not as good a tool for measuring the risk as these are, and according to a previous report of the Health 2000 study, it did not predict decline in memory functions.Two-hour glucose in a glucose tolerance test is a commonly used test in healthcare services, where it is used to study whether the person being tested has diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. According to the definition, a person has impaired glucose tolerance when glucose level in two-hour glucose tolerance test is elevated, but the diagnostic criteria for diabetes are not met. In the new study, the researchers studied whether the glucose levels of two-hour glucose tolerance test are connected to cognitive functions after a ten-year follow-up period. The surveys were conducted in 2000 2002 and 2011 for a total of 961 participants. Memory and other cognitive functions were measured with three tests which are commonly used in e.g. diagnostics and follow-up of patients suffering from memory disorders. The study suggested that higher blood glucose level measured in a glucose tolerance test in 2001 2002 was associated with weaker performance in a memory test conducted in 2011, in which the participants needed to recall a previously learned list of words after a delay. ""The glucose level measured in the two-hour glucose tolerance test was also associated with a greater decline in the results of the test during the follow-up period.

During the first survey, the participants were aged 45 74 years (mean 55.6 years).""The study shows that glucose tolerance test helps identify patients with impaired glucose tolerance who have a heightened risk of cognitive decline.

The researchers, Dr Adelina Gschwandtner (Kent s School of Economics), Dr Sarah Jewell and Professor Uma Kambhampati (both from the University of Reading s School of Economics), used an instrumental variable approach to filter out any effect from happiness to lifestyle. It showed that it is rather the consumption of fruit and vegetables and exercising that makes people happy and not the other way round.Findings demonstrate that the ability of individuals to delay gratification and apply self-control plays a major role in influencing lifestyle decisions, which in turn has a positive impact on wellbeing. The research also shows that men appear to exercise more, and women eat more fruit and vegetables.With it being well known that lifestyle diseases are a leading cause of ill health and mortality worldwide, and the UK having one of the highest obesity rates in Europe, these findings could have significant implications for public health policy.Dr Gschwandtner said:  Behavioural nudges that help the planning self to reinforce long-term objectives are likely to be especially helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If a better lifestyle not only makes us healthier but also happier, then it is a clear win-win situation. Professor Kambhampati said:  There has been a bigger shift in recent years for healthier lifestyle choices. To establish that eating more fruit and vegetables and exercising can increase happiness as well as offer health benefits is a major development.

We wanted to understand the spectrum of allergies to the new vaccines and understand what was causing them,  said the study s senior author, Kari Nadeau, MD, PhD, the Naddisy Foundation Professor in Pediatric Food Allergy, Immunology, and Asthma.The study analyzed 22 potential allergic reactions to the first 39,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines given to health care providers at Stanford soon after the vaccines received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.Most of those in the study who developed reactions were allergic to an ingredient that helps stabilize the COVID-19 vaccines; they did not show allergies to the vaccine components that provide immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, these allergic reactions occurred via an indirect activation of allergy pathways, which makes them easier to mitigate than many allergic responses.  It s nice to know these reactions are manageable,  said Nadeau, who directs the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford.  Having an allergic reaction to these new vaccines is uncommon, and if it does happen, there s a way to manage it. The study s lead author is former postdoctoral scholar Christopher Warren, PhD, now an assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.The research also suggests how vaccine manufacturers can reformulate the vaccines to make them less likely to trigger allergic responses, Nadeau said.","Published: September 20, 2021"

This work clearly demonstrates a much more sophisticated role for this neurotransmitter than was previously appreciated, and it means we need to rethink models of addiction that depend on the dopamine/drug reward mentality,  said Danny Winder, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Addiction Research.  In the press, dopamine is often referred to as a  pleasure molecule  or a  reward molecule,  said Calipari, who also is a faculty member of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute and the Center for Addiction Research.  In the scientific community, research has helped us understand that dopamine s role in learning and memory is more complex than that, but we did not have a complete and accurate theory that could explain what dopamine actually does in the brain. The prevailing model, called the reward prediction error theory, is based on the idea that dopamine signals predictions about when rewards will occur. This theory suggests that dopamine is a tracker of every error we make when we try to achieve rewards. The authors show that RPE is only accurate in a subset of learning scenarios by proving that  while rewards increase dopamine, so do stressful stimuli,  Calipari said.  We then go on to show that dopamine is not a reward molecule at all. It instead helps encode information about all types of important and relevant events and drive adaptive behavior regardless of whether it is positive or negative. The researchers collaborated with Lin Tian, professor and vice chair of biochemistry and molecular medicine at UC Davis, to use cutting-edge technology to study an unprecedented diversity of neurobehavioral processes related to dopamine release. The authors used machine learning and computational modeling to analyze the data, along with optogenetic manipulations, which use light to control activity of genetically modified neurons.The analysis established a novel computational model of behavior that shows  accurate prediction of the behavioral impact of optogenetic perturbations of dopamine release.  Calipari concluded that  this work replaces our current understanding with a formalized theory and calls for revision of textbook facts regarding dopamine in the central nervous system. A common theme of all drugs of abuse is that they increase dopamine release in the brain, which helped feed the notion of dopamine as a reward molecule. This work clearly demonstrates a much more sophisticated role for this neurotransmitter, and it means we need to rethink models of addiction that depend on the dopamine/drug reward mentality,  said Danny Winder, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Addiction Research.Calipari emphasizes that  these data rewrite facts about dopamine, including what it encodes within the brain and how it drives behavior.  This is incredibly important as dopamine is dysregulated in Parkinson s disease and in nearly every psychiatric disease: addiction, anxiety and depression, schizophrenia and others, she said. Understanding what these dopamine deficits mean will be critical in understanding patients  symptoms and in developing better evidence-based treatments for these diseases. We plan to research how this framework fits into our understanding of drug addiction and how drugs alter dopamine signaling to disrupt behavior within this novel framework,  Calipari said.  Most of our understanding of addiction neurobiology centers around dopamine and the dopaminergic network, as many therapeutic approaches that aim to treat addiction target dopamine. However, altering dopamine without having a full understanding of what dopamine actually does may lead to many unforeseen side effects, and more importantly, failed treatment strategies. This new knowledge about what dopamine actually does will affect many fields outside neuroscience and have a strong impact on human lives and health outcomes.

As well as looking at the standard two full doses of the Pfizer vaccine, we will look at how well volunteers respond when their second dose of Pfizer is half that of the first dose, or if different vaccines are used altogether, such as the vaccines manufactured by Moderna or Novavax. This will provide the JCVI with information crucial to informing their advice about immunising teenagers in the UK. Participants can either receive two COVID-19 vaccine doses in the study, in which case their first dose will be the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Alternatively, those who have already received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine through the NHS can be enrolled at the time of their second dose.All participants will be randomly allocated at the time of the second dose to receive either a full dose or half dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a full dose of the Novavax vaccine or a half dose of the Moderna vaccine.Professor Matthew Snape said:  This is the latest in series of studies such as COMCOV and COV-Boost that have looked at ways the different COVID-19 vaccines available in the UK can be used to generate the best and most durable immune response, in as safe a manner as possible. The study is single-blind and randomised, meaning participants will not know what second dose vaccine they are receiving. Researchers will assess reactogenicity (any side effects) and immune system responses to these new combinations of vaccines.Professor Andrew Ustianowski, NIHR Clinical Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Programme and Joint National Infection Specialty Lead, said:  It is important to establish the most effective vaccine doses for different population groups, and this latest study will help develop our understanding of immune responses for young people once vaccinated against COVID-19. We continue to see valuable contributions from volunteers across COVID-19 vaccine research across the UK to help us identify the best vaccine schedules, and I hope we see similar levels of engagement with the Com-Cov 3 study. The study hopes to report initial results by December   if the results are promising, regulators MHRA and JCVI would formally assess the safety and efficacy of any new vaccination process before advising whether it is rolled out to patients.All those who are interested can register via the study website comcovstudy.org.ukThis article has been republished from the following materials.

They found that neutralizing antibody levels, the key protective immunity, dropped significantly over seven to nine months after the two-dose vaccination. This drop of neutralizing antibody levels correlates to the observation of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. After a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the neutralizing antibody levels increased many-fold higher than that after the second dose. More importantly, the third dose increased the antibody s ability to inhibit variants more efficiently, including Beta and Delta variants.  The safety and antibody response of a booster dose administered seven to nine months after the regular two-dose series suggests that a third dose could prolong protection and further increase the breadth of protection against variants,  said Pei-Yong Shi, professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at UTMB, who is responsible for the neutralization study detailed in the publication.Reference: Falsey AR, Frenck RW, Walsh EE, et al.

Only a few years ago it was discovered that the outer layer of the meninges is interlaced with lymphatic vessels. As these vessels are known to transport immune cells   the white blood cells   this finding has increasingly brought into focus that the meninges contain unexpectedly large numbers of these cells, which are part of the body s defence system. So apparently, the meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which form a sac in which the brain and spinal cord  swim , not only protect the brain from external influences such as trauma, but probably also play an important role in inflammation of the brain. Scientists at the University of M nster, Germany, have now systematically investigated exactly which immune cells populate the meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid in healthy conditions. We systematically scanned the brain tissue for immune cells and analysed which cell types are present in which quantity in the different parts of the tissue,  explains Dr Gerd Meyer zu H rste, neurologist and head of the study. As human samples of healthy brain tissue are not available in sufficient quantities to obtain statistically meaningful results in such a screening, the scientists primarily worked with tissues from mice and rats. They found that different types of white blood cells   the T and B cells, natural killer cells, scavenger cells and granulocytes, and their subtypes   are present in different and very specific compositions in the meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid. They also showed that different genes are active in the same cell types depending on which tissue they are located in   meaning that the cells obviously perform different functions there. The scientists were surprised to find large numbers of B cells and their immature progenitors in the outer layer of the meninges   the dura mater, or dura. Importantly, they were able to confirm this finding in targeted studies in human tissue.  The fact that this cell type resides and probably even develops in the dura suggests that it fulfils a special immune system function there,  says Gerd Meyer zu H rste. He adds that, if further studies can identify in which diseases this occurs and how, these cells may offer a new target in the fight against these diseases.","Published: September 20, 2021"

Wait a few years to coat your home with the world s whitest paint, which may dramatically reduce or even eliminate the need for air conditioning.The paint, developed at Purdue University, has earned a Guinness World RecordsTM title. The record appears in the 2022 edition of Guinness World Records, available for purchase starting Thursday (Sept. 16). Breaking a record for the whitest paint wasn t a goal for the researchers   curbing global warming was.  When we started this project about seven years ago, we had saving energy and fighting climate change in mind,  said Xiulin Ruan, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue, in a podcast episode of  This Is Purdue.  Ruan invented the paint with his graduate students. The idea was to create paint that would reflect sunlight away from a building. Making this paint really reflective, however, also made it really white. The formulation that Ruan s lab created reflects 98.1% of solar radiation at the same time as emitting infrared heat. Because the paint absorbs less heat from the sun than it emits, a surface coated with this paint is cooled below the surrounding temperature without consuming power. Typical commercial white paint gets warmer rather than cooler. Paints on the market that are designed to reject heat reflect only 80%-90% of sunlight and can t make surfaces cooler than their surroundings. Using this new paint formulation to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet could result in a cooling power of 10 kilowatts, Purdue researchers showed in a published paper.  That s more powerful than the air conditioners used by most houses,  Ruan said. This white paint is the result of research building on attempts going back to the 1970s to develop radiative cooling paint as a feasible alternative to traditional air conditioners. Ruan s lab had considered over 100 different materials, narrowed them down to 10 and tested about 50 different formulations for each material. Two features make this paint ultra-white: a very high concentration of a chemical compound called barium sulfate   also used in photo paper and cosmetics   and different particle sizes of barium sulfate in the paint. What wavelength of sunlight each particle scatters depends on its size, so a wider range of particle sizes allows the paint to scatter more of the light spectrum from the sun. There is a little bit of room to make the paint whiter, but not much without compromising the paint.ReferenceLi X, Peoples J, Yao P, Ruan X.

For the first time, scientists led by UC Riverside have synthesized strigolactones from microbes. The work is published in the open-access journal, Science Advances.Strigolactones also help plant roots form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms that allow the plant to absorb nutrients from the soil. These two factors have led to agricultural interest in using strigolactones to control the growth of weeds and root parasites, as well as improving nutrient uptake. These root-extruding compounds don t come without risks. They also stimulate germination of witchweeds and broomrapes, which can cause entire crops of grain to fail, making thorough research essential prior to commercial development. Scientists are still learning about the physiological roles played by this diverse group of hormones in plants. Until recently, manufacturing pure strigolactones for scientific study has been difficult and too costly for agricultural use.  Our work provides a unique platform to investigate strigolactone biosynthesis and evolution, and it lays the foundation for developing strigolactone microbial bioproduction processes as alternative sourcing,  said corresponding author Yanran Li, a UC Riverside assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering.Together with co-corresponding author Kang Zhou at National University Singapore, Li directed a group that inserted plant genes associated with strigolactone production into ordinary baker s yeast and nonpathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria that together produced a range of strigolactones. Producing strigolactones from yeast turned out to be very challenging. Although engineered yeast is known to modify the strigolactone precursor, called carlactone, it could not synthesize carlactone with any of the specific genes used by the researchers.   This project started in early 2018, yet for over 20 months there was basically no progress. The gatekeeping enzyme DWRF27 is not functional no matter how we try in yeast,  Li said.  Kang developed a microbial consortium technique to produce a Taxol precursor in 2015 and that inspired this wonderful collaboration.  The team turned toward E. coli, which had already been shown capable of producing carlactone. The carlactone it produced, however, was unstable and could not be further modified by engineered E. coli into any strigolactones. Li s group managed to optimize and stabilize the carlactone precursor. To their delight, when the yeast and bacteria were cultured together in the same medium, the E. coli and yeast worked as a team: E. coli made carlactone, and the yeast transformed it into various final strigolactone products. The method also produced enough strigolactones to extract and study. Using this platform, the group identified the function of multiple strigolactone biosynthetic enzymes, showing that sweet orange and grape have the potential to synthesize orobanchol-type strigolactones. The team also engineered microbe metabolism to boost strigolactone production threefold to 47 micrograms per liter, enough for scientific study. Though commercial production of strigolactones is still a long way off, the new method for biosynthesizing them from a yeast-bacterium consortium will help scientists learn more about this important group of plant hormones, especially the enzymes involved. Enzymes are protein catalysts and are responsible for modification of carlactone by yeast. Because carlactone is unstable, it cannot be purchased from commercial sources. As a result, many plant scientists have difficulty studying new enzymes that may work to transform carlactone into strigolactones. The new yeast-bacterium co-culture provides a convenient way for scientists to complete such works because the bacterium makes carlactone in situ,  Zhou said.  With discovery of more enzymes and optimization of the microbial consortium, we can manufacture strigolactones in quantity in the future. Reference: Wu S, Ma X, Zhou A, Valenzuela A, Zhou K, Li Y.

Now Curtin research has found that adding nickel and cobalt to cheaper, previously ineffective catalysts enhances their performance, which lowers the energy required to split the water and increases the yield of hydrogen. Lead researcher Dr Guohua Jia, from Curtin s School of Molecular and Life Sciences, said this discovery could have far-reaching implications for sustainable green fuel generation in the future.  Our research essentially saw us take two-dimensional iron-sulfur nanocrystals, which don t usually work as catalysts for the electricity-driven reaction that gets hydrogen from water, and add small amounts of nickel and cobalt ions. When we did this it completely transformed the poor-performing iron-sulfur into a viable and efficient catalyst,  Dr Jia said.  Using these more abundant materials is cheaper and more efficient than the current benchmark material, ruthenium oxide, which is derived from ruthenium element and is expensive.  Our findings not only broaden the existing  palette  of possible particle combinations, but also introduce a new, efficient catalyst that may be useful in other applications.  It also opens new avenues for future research in the energy sector, putting Australia at the forefront of renewable and clean energy research and applications.  Dr Jia said the next steps would be to expand and test the team s work on a larger scale to test its commercial viability.  Only 21% of energy is produced from renewables in the national energy market, which clearly indicates more efforts are required from Australia to make a transition from fossil fuels to clean energy,  Dr Jia said.  But this shift is only possible when the knowledge from the research sector gets translated into real-world solutions and applications in the energy sector. ReferenceJavaid S, Xu X, Chen W, et al.

These results indicate that this immunotherapy treatment which currently is approved only for stage III and IV melanomas may be appropriate for patients with earlier stages of melanoma.The study was led by Jason Luke, M.D., director of the Cancer Immunotherapeutics Center at UPMC Hillman and associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. He delivered the results on behalf of a leading international group of melanoma oncologists, including John Kirkwood, M.D., also of UPMC Hillman, as well as the study sponsor Merck, during a presentation today at ESMO Congress 2021. Patients with stage IIb and IIc melanomas have a high level of risk for the disease coming back after surgery,  said Luke.  This is a very important clinical trial as it shows that pembrolizumab reduces that risk. Based on these results, I believe that we should be offering patients in this situation the opportunity to get this treatment after surgery. Pembrolizumab often is used as adjuvant immunotherapy following surgical removal of stage III melanomas, in which the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, and for treatment of metastatic stage IV melanomas. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved the drug for patients with earlier stages, such as IIb and IIc melanomas invasive tumors that extend deep into the skin or have broken the overlying skin, which is known as ulceration. In most cancers, it s automatically worse if the cancer moves beyond the primary location to the lymph nodes. But melanoma is idiosyncratic in that the risk of long-term relapse and death is similar among patients with stage IIIa and IIIb melanoma, with lymph node involvement, compared with stage IIb and IIc, which lack lymph node involvement,  said Luke.  So, in a sense it has been unfair that these patients couldn t get pembrolizumab because they were excluded from initial trials. With this trial, we hoped to right that wrong. The multi-country KEYNOTE-716 trial enrolled 976 patients with stage IIb or IIc melanomas. After surgery, 487 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab and 489 received a placebo every three weeks for one year. Patients were monitored for cancer recurrence via computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging.The researchers found that patients who received the drug had a 35% lower risk of death or melanoma relapse compared to those who got the placebo.On the basis of these findings, Merck has submitted an application to the FDA for treatment of stage IIb and IIc melanoma with pembrolizumab, which is undergoing priority review.At a median follow-up time of 14.4 months, 136 patients had disease recurrence or died: 54 in the pembrolizumab group and 82 in the placebo group. The fact that patients in this trial had very rapid recurrences in distant organs which is metastatic cancer drives home the point that stage IIb and IIc melanomas are high risk,  said Luke.  There has been the idea that because these cancers don t involve the lymph nodes, they re not such a big deal. But that s clearly wrong. The KEYNOTE-716 trial is ongoing, and the researchers will continue to monitor participants for cancer recurrence or death. The trial is still very early, and we expect to see the benefit of pembrolizumab increase above 35% over time,  said Luke.In part two of the trial, patients in the placebo group who had their cancer return will be offered pembrolizumab. This will help clinicians figure out whether it is better to give the treatment right after melanoma surgery or wait until the cancer returns.About 18% of participants receiving pembrolizumab experienced significant adverse effects that required long-term hormone replacement. According to Luke, this level of drug safety was expected based on previous trials, and they did not observe new or unexpected side effects.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Researchers found that levetiracetam was not related to fractures, but oxcarbazepine was associated with a higher risk of fracture for children with epilepsy. Prior to this study, little research had been conducted on how these two commonly prescribed medications impact bone fragility,  said Daniel Whitney, Ph.D., lead author of the paper and assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Michigan Medicine.  These findings provide a vital insight into how two commonly prescribed medications impact children and adolescents during a critical period of bone development. During the pre-to-mid-puberty stage, several features   like genetics, bone structure and bone biology   coalesce to develop the bone strength that peaks in adulthood. Disruptions during those critical years can compound to have lasting impacts on the musculoskeletal system.The research team observed fracture incidence rates over a five-year period between 561 children and teenagers with epilepsy, and around 271,000 without epilepsy who did not take anti-seizure medications. In that time, 12.8% of children on oxcarbazepine sustained a fracture, compared to 7.5% taking levetiracetam and 8.2% without epilepsy.These two drugs are commonly prescribed because they have relatively safer side effect profiles compared to some of the other anti-seizure medications offered, said Erin Fedak Romanowski, D.O., a corresponding author of the paper and clinical assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Michigan Medicine. Knowing that oxcarbazepine is associated with a higher fracture risk will allow clinicians to be more thoughtful about to which children they prescribe the medication,  Fedak Romanowski said.  Some children are going to be at higher risk for fracture than others at baseline; this is another factor to consider when evaluating the complexities of what drugs to use for whom and when. Whitney noted the findings do not mean that oxcarbazepine is unsafe to prescribe, nor that all children with epilepsy should be on levetiracetam.Many children and adolescents with the epilepsy have associated neurodevelopmental disorders, like cerebral palsy. That pediatric patient population is known to have a high risk of fracture, but side effects of levetiracetam may affect a child s mental health, which is also a common comorbidity for kids with neurodevelopmental disorders.This concept is known as iatrogenesis, or medical issues that occur because of medical care. The anti-seizure medications accomplish their self-titled purpose, but some can spur secondary complications like bone fragility and mood or behavior problems. Our goal for patients is  no seizures, no side effects,  Fedak Romanowski said.  However, there is no perfect anti-seizure medication, and all have potential adverse effects,  she said.  But physicians can take all of this available information to take a personalized approach that optimizes individual patient health outcomes. Whitney said his next step is a follow-up study to find out why oxcarbazepine is linked to the increase in fragility fractures during this unique window of time. Then, the team concluded, they can assess whether the children could benefit from supplementary bone fragility therapies. As bone development has distinct periods that establish certain structural aspects, we are interested in studying if some medications alter the needed biology to form the bone s structure,  Whitney said.  If so, perhaps we can develop adjunct treatment to counteract these effects, so children can benefit by seizure reduction without weaker bones.

In the future, such a map could help to further optimize processing and production processes by making the flavor profiles of cocoa-containing products, such as chocolate, objectively predictable on the basis of molecular parameters,  says food chemist Andreas Dunkel of the LSB, who played a leading role in the study.Various flavor substances including secondary plant compounds, such as health-promoting flavanols, are crucial for the taste of cocoa. The particular class of these substances is what creates the typical astringent feeling in the mouth which strikes us as the pleasantly bitter and slightly sour taste of cocoa or chocolate. In cocoa producing countries, quality assessment of cocoa is currently carried out mainly by random visual inspection of the beans (cut test) and sensory trained personnel. In addition, chocolate manufacturers use time-consuming and personnel-intensive methods to test the quality of cocoa. The new method offers significant advantages over these conventional analytical methods.  Our new methodology requires minimal sample preparation and provides quantitative data on 66 taste-decisive substances using a single mass spectrometric platform,  says Thomas Kauz, who made crucial contributions to the development of the method as part of his doctoral thesis at the Chair of Food Chemistry and Molecular Sensory Analysis at TUM.  Traditional techniques make it possible to analyze about 10 samples per week, whereas this new method allows an analysis of 200 in that time,  according to Professor Corinna Dawid, who is head of the department on behalf of Professor Thomas Hofmann. Furthermore, she states, the methodology can be easily implemented into industrial workflows.The team of scientists tested their new methodology on a set of 75 cocoa samples from around the world. They compared unroasted samples with those that the researchers had roasted in the lab using a uniform standard procedure.  Interestingly, we found that the roasting of the cocoa influenced the flavor profile more than the respective regional origin of the beans,  declares Andreas Dunkel. With the help of the new methodology, it is now possible to investigate the influence of other factors including the genetic predisposition of the plants and the type of fermentation, as well. Professor Veronika Somoza, director of the LSB, and Professor Corinna Dawid both agree that a long-term goal of the joint research at TUM and LSB is to supplement the world map of cocoa with all these data on sensory active substances.ReferenceKauz T, Dunkel A, Hofmann T.

Their study was published in Nature Communications on 17 September and highlights the usefulness of organoids for basic research into coronaviruses, as well as highlighting potential drug targets.Organoids are tiny 3D structures grown from stem cells that mimic organ function. Researchers have previously succeeded in developing organoid models for various organs, including the gut, lung, uterus and even the snake venom gland. The organoids have proven useful for diagnostic purposes, predicting therapy responses in patients and unlocking secrets about the development of tissues and rare cell types.Host factorsResearchers can add levels of complexity to the organoid cultures for specific purposes. They can for example add immune cells to tumor organoids to study the efficacy of therapy, or inject pathogens into organoids to model their effect on the cells. The latter approach has recently been used to model coronavirus infections in human cells. One of the key questions about the coronavirus   and viruses in general   is what factors it uses to enter human cells and replicate. These so-called host factors could be appealing drug targets to influence viral replication and -spreading.  Biobank of intestinal organoidsTo find out more about the host factors that are specifically important for the replication and spreading of coronaviruses, the groups of Hans Clevers and Bart Haagmans developed a biobank of mutant intestinal organoids. This means that the organoids, that mimic the biology of the intestine, contained various mutations in the host factors that were previously discovered to be relevant for coronaviruses. These mutations cause changes in the activity of the host factors.TMPRSS2 as therapeutic targetConsequently, the researchers injected the mutant organoids with SARS-CoV-2   the virus responsible for COVID-19   to study the effect of the mutations on the replication and spreading of the virus. Among other things, they identified the gene TMPRSS2 to be involved in this process: organoids with non-functioning TMPRSS2 showed reduced replication and spreading of the virus. This gene may therefore be an attractive therapeutic target for this coronavirus. Specific inhibitors for TMPRSS2 have recently been developed.Relevance of human modelsPreviously, studies used cell lines of animals (most importantly, of the African green monkey) to identify therapeutic targets for the coronavirus. These cell lines are easy to work with, but do not fully recapitulate the biology of human cells that are targets of SARS-CoV-2. This is illustrated by the anti-malaria drug Chloroquine, which was found to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in these cell lines, but turned out to be ineffective in clinical trials with patients. This indicates that the cell lines cannot sufficiently predict the effectiveness of therapeutics in humans. When repeating the Chloroquine-experiments using the mutant organoids instead of previously used cell lines, the research groups observed no therapeutic effect. In other words, the results in organoids were similar to the results in clinical trials, suggesting that   compared to animal cell lines   the organoids could be better suited to predict the effectiveness of therapeutics in humans.  Future virusesWith their study, published in Nature Communications, the groups of Hans Clevers and Bart Haagmans underscore the relevance of organoids for research into coronaviruses. Furthermore, they identify TMPSS2 as a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV2. Their newly developed biobank could also aid in screening future emerging viruses to rapidly identify therapeutic targets.Reference: Beumer J, Geurts MH, Lamers MM, et al.

The approach, proven in mice experiments, was reported in the Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer.The activation of checkpoint proteins on the surfaces of immune cells help regulate the immune response by preventing them from indiscriminately attacking the body s other cells. But some cancer cells are able to hijack this mechanism, preventing an immune response against them as well. Scientists have recently developed immune checkpoint inhibitors that can counteract this strategy, but some people are resistant to the treatments.Now, scientists at Hokkaido University and Aichi Institute of Technology have found a way around this by developing a specially designed lipid nanoparticle that can carry immunity-triggering molecules into immune cells in the liver called macrophages.The lipid, called YSK12-C4, has a high affinity for immune cells. When intravenously injected into mice with metastatic melanoma, it was able to deliver signaling molecules, called cyclic dinucleotides, across the cell membranes of their liver macrophages, where they stimulated the production of immune-related proteins called type 1 interferons via a stimulator of an interferon gene (STING) pathway. These were released into the blood, activating another type of immune cell called natural killer cells in the spleen and lung, which produced interferon-gamma inside the lung metastases.This treatment, on its own, only elicited a mild anti-tumor effect. This is because the type 1 interferons and interferon-gamma triggered the expression of a protein called PD-L1 on the cancer cells. PD-L1 prevents a strong tumor-killing immune response of natural killer cells that express PD-1. Administering an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy treatment, however, prevented the cancer cells from turning off those natural killer cells, which then became armed and able to launch a full-scale attack. The findings suggest that our lipid nanoparticles carrying immune-signaling molecules convert the immune status from immunologically cold to immunologically hot,  says Takashi Nakamura of Hokkaido University s faculty of pharmaceutical sciences.  This could lead to the development of a promising adjuvant that reduces resistance to anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in some cancer patients. Further studies will need to examine whether the treatment can cause liver toxicity and if different signaling molecules can be used.Reference: Nakamura T, Sato T, Endo R, et al.

Mutations in these genes, scientists believed, thus allow tumors to flourish unchecked. Now, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Stephen Elledge s team has uncovered a surprising new action for many of these defective genes. More than 100 mutated tumor suppressor genes can prevent the immune system from spotting and destroying malignant cells in mice , Elledge, a geneticist at Brigham and Women s Hospital, reports September 16, 2021, in the journal Science.  The shock was that these genes are all about getting around the immune system, as opposed to simply saying  grow, grow, grow!  he says.Conventional wisdom had suggested that, for the vast major of tumor suppressor genes, mutations allow cells to run amok, growing and dividing uncontrollably. But that explanation had some gaps. For example, mutated versions of many of these genes don t actually cause rampant growth when put into cells in a petri dish. And scientists couldn t explain why the immune system, which is normally highly proficient at attacking abnormal cells, doesn t do more to nip new tumors in the bud.Elledge s new paper offers some answers. His team probed the effects of 7,500 genes, including genes known to be involved in human cancer. A third or more of those cancer-linked genes, when mutated, trigger mechanisms that prevent the immune system from rooting out tumors, often in a tissue-specific manner.  These results reveal a fascinating and unexpected relationship between tumor suppressor genes and the immune system,  says HHMI Investigator Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at the Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the research.

A team led by Prof. Dr. Peter Krawitz from the University of Bonn had already shown in 2020 that artificial intelligence can help with the diagnosis of such lymphomas and leukemias. The technology fully utilizes the potential of all measurement values and increases the speed as well as the objectivity of the analyses compared to established processes. The method has now been further developed so that even smaller laboratories can benefit from this freely accessible machine learning method - an important step towards clinical practice. The study has now been published in the journal Patterns.Lymph nodes become swollen, there is weight loss and fatigue, as well as fevers and infections - these are typical symptoms of malignant B-cell lymphomas and related leukemias. If such a cancer of the lymphatic system is suspected, the physician takes a blood or bone marrow sample and sends it to specialized laboratories. This is where flow cytometry comes in. Flow cytometry is a method in which the blood cells flow past measurement sensors at high speed. The properties of the cells can be detected depending on their shape, structure or coloring. Detection and accurate characterization of pathological cells is important when making a diagnosis.The laboratories use ""antibodies"" that dock to the surface of the cells and are coupled to fluorescent dyes. Such markers can also be used to detect small differences between cancer cells and healthy blood cells. Flow cytometry generates large amounts of data. On average, more than 50,000 cells are measured per sample. These data are then typically analyzed on screen by plotting the expression of the markers used against each other. ""But with 20 markers, the doctor would already have to compare about 150 two-dimensional images,"" says Prof. Dr. Peter Krawitz of the Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics at the University Hospital Bonn. ""That's why it's usually too costly to thoroughly sift through the entire data set.""For this reason, Krawitz, together with the bioinformaticians Nanditha Mallesh and Max Zhao, investigated how artificial intelligence can be used to analyze cytometry data. The team considered more than 30,000 data sets from patients with B-cell lymphoma to train artificial intelligence (AI). ""AI takes full advantage of the data and increases the speed and objectivity of diagnoses,"" says lead author Nanditha Mallesh. The result of the AI evaluations is a suggested diagnosis that still needs to be verified by the physician. In the process, the AI provides indications of conspicuous cells.Specialists reviewed the results of artificial intelligenceBlood samples and cytometer data were obtained from the Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), the Charit  - Universit tsmedizin Berlin, the University Hospital Erlangen and the Bonn University Hospital. Specialists from these institutions examined the results of artificial intelligence. ""The gold standard is diagnosis by hematologists, which can also take into account results of additional tests,"" Krawitz says. ""The point of using AI is not to replace physicians, but to make the best use of the information contained in the data."" The great new feature of the AI now presented lies in the possibility of knowledge transfer: Particularly smaller laboratories that cannot afford their own bioinformatics expertise and may also have too few samples to develop their own AI from scratch can benefit from this. After a short training phase, during which the AI learns the specifics of the new laboratory, it can then draw on knowledge derived from many thousands of data sets.All raw data and the complete software are open source and therefore freely accessible. In addition, res mechanica GmbH, which was involved in the study, has developed a web service that makes artificial intelligence usable even for users without bioinformatics expertise. ""With https://hema.to, we want to enable the exchange of anonymized flow cytometry data between laboratories and in this way create the conditions for even higher quality in diagnostics,"" says Dr. Hannes L ling of res mechanica.Great potentialThe team sees huge potential in this technology. The researchers therefore also want to collaborate with major manufacturers of analytics equipment and software to further advance the use of artificial intelligence. In the case of B-cell lymphomas, for example, genetic and cytomorphological data are also collected to confirm the diagnoses. ""If we succeed in using AI for these methods as well, we would have an even more powerful tool,"" says Krawitz, who is also a member of the Cluster of Excellence ImmunoSensation2 at the University of Bonn. The artificial intelligence developed can in principle also be used for diagnoses of rheumatic diseases, which are often also based on flow cytometric data.Reference: Mallesh N, Zhao M, Meintker L, et al.

These finds, first unearthed from Contrebandiers Cave, Morocco in 2011, are highly suggestive proxy evidence for the earliest clothing in the archaeological record and attest to the pan-African emergence of complex culture and specialized tool manufacture.The invention of clothing, and the development of the tools needed to create it, are milestones in the story of humanity. Not only are they indicative of strides in cultural and cognitive evolution, archaeologists also believe they were essential in enabling early humans to expand their niche from Pleistocene Africa into new environments with new ecological challenges. However, as furs and other organic materials used to make clothing are unlikely to be preserved in the archaeological record, the origin of clothing is still poorly understood. The current study, which reports on a worked bone assemblage found near the Atlantic Coast of Morocco, provides strong evidence for the manufacture of clothing as far back as 120,000 years ago. As part of her research with the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University and the  Lise Meitner  Pan-African Evolution research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (MPI-SHH), Dr. Emily Hallett was studying the vertebrate remains from Contrebandiers Cave deposits dating from 120,000 to 90,000 years ago.   This was a critical time period and location for the early members of our species,  says Hallett,  and I was primarily interested in reconstructing the diet and habitat niche of the people who used this cave.  Among the roughly 12,000 bone fragments, Hallett found more than 60 animal bones that had been shaped by humans for use as tools. At the same time, Hallett identified a pattern of cut marks on the carnivore bones suggesting that, rather than processing them for meat, the occupants of Contrebandiers Cave were skinning them for fur. Hallett compared the tools she identified with others in the archaeological record and found that they had the same shapes and use marks as leather working tools described by other researchers.  The combination of carnivore bones with skinning marks and bone tools likely used for fur processing provide highly suggestive proxy evidence for the earliest clothing in the archaeological record,  says Hallett,  but given the level of specialization in this assemblage, these tools are likely part of a larger tradition with earlier examples that haven t yet been found.  Also hidden amongst the bone fragments was the tip of a tooth from a whale or dolphin bearing marks consistent with use as a pressure flaker (a tool used for shaping stone tools). Given the age of the find, this represents the earliest documented use of a marine mammal tooth by humans and the only verified marine mammal remain from the Pleistocene of North Africa.  The Contrebandiers Cave bone tools demonstrate that by roughly 120,000 years ago, Homo sapiens began to intensify the use of bone to make formal tools and use them for specific tasks, including leather and fur working,  Hallett summarizes.  This versatility appears to be at the root of our species, and not a characteristic that emerged after expansions into Eurasia.  In the future, Hallett hopes to collaborate with other researchers to identify comparable skinning patterns in the assemblages they study and gain a better understanding of the origins and diffusion of this behavior.ReferenceHallett EY, Marean CW, Steele TE, et al.

That s a question that has stirred lively debate within the U.S. health care system for years, but certain temporary deviations in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may offer a blueprint for regulatory oversight of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), according to a new study by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) published in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics. This research provides concrete data that suggests what FDA regulation of LDTs might look like. This data could help inform pending legislation aiming to change the regulatory oversight of certain  high risk  LDTs.Diagnosing many human diseases relies on in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests, which include tests performed in a test tube, culture dish, or elsewhere outside a living organism. (IVDs are also sometimes called in vitro clinical tests, or IVCTs.) The FDA already closely regulates commercially available IVDs, requiring manufacturers to submit data for premarket approval before they can be sold. However, clinical laboratories located in hospitals and other health care settings can create their own IVDs for in-house use, which are known as LDTs. Historically, the FDA has exercised little oversight of LDTs (so-called enforcement discretion). However, that policy changed with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, notes Jochen Lennerz, MD, PhD, medical director of the MGH Center for Integrated Diagnostics (CID) and the study s senior author. In March 2020, the FDA asserted authority over LDTs, requiring labs that produced them for detecting COVID-19 to undergo emergency use authorization (EUA). Requiring makers of LDTs to submit validation data to enable assessment of performance and accuracy of their assays was the first time the FDA took concrete steps to regulate in-house diagnostic tests, a significant deviation from policy. That requirement was later rescinded and labs were once again allowed to administer LDTs without FDA authorization. However, the FDA required the makers of LDTs that had received EUAs and makers of manufactured tests to validate their products  accuracy by running them on a reference panel that served as a gold standard for detecting COVID-19. This so-called labeling update study was a second deviation from FDA policy regarding regulation of LDTs.Using data from their own lab, as well as from facilities around the nation, Lennerz and his colleagues analyzed the impact of these two deviations and found several key takeaways: Yet there s critical data that the labeling update study did not measure, notes Lennerz. Manufacturers submitted data about the performance of their IVDs based on their own in-house testing. But how well do manufacturers  IVDs perform in the real world, when they re used in hospital pathology labs?  The quality of a diagnostic test relies heavily on the competence of people,  says Lennerz.  We all make errors from time to time. What the performance of manufacturers  tests looks like routinely and across clinical laboratories remains a question mark. And we currently do not have the tools to assess this systematically. However, one of two bills that Congress is considering, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act, proposes mechanisms to expand regulatory oversight by the FDA. In one of these proposed mechanisms, known as technology certification, a laboratory would submit data about the design and performance of the highest-complexity test that it performs to the FDA, which would conduct a detailed review. This test would serve as a representative for the lab s entire design-validation process. In contrast, the competing bill (known as the VITAL Act) does not provide such mechanisms or details. VALID proposes to place responsibility for oversight of high-risk LDTs in the hands of the FDA, which Lennerz feels is the right choice.  I think the FDA has the appropriate standing to obtain comprehensive comparison data and help establish tools to regulate complex diagnostic tests,  he says.Lennerz is also an associate professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.This work was funded in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.

People are trying to make more informed choices about the food they eat, in particular the environmental footprint of their food,  said Ben Halpern(link is external) a marine ecologist at UC Santa Barbara s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, who with colleagues examined the environmental sustainability of aquatic foods(link is external), the potential for the growth of small-scale producers(link is external) and the climate risks that face aquatic food systems(link is external).  For the first time we pulled together data from hundreds of studies on a wide range of seafood species to help answer that question. Blue foods stack up really well overall and provide a great option for sustainable food.  The research projects that global demand for blue foods will roughly double by 2050, and will be met primarily through increased aquaculture production rather than by capture fisheries. Investing in innovation and improving fisheries management could increase consumption even more and have profound effects on malnutrition. For instance, a  high growth  modeling scenario showed that increasing supply by 15.5 million tons (8%), causing a drop in prices, would reduce cases of nutrient deficiencies by 166 million, especially among low-income populations.  Small-scale fishers   the individuals and small boats that fish in places all around the world   are a huge part of the global seafood system and are incredibly diverse in who they are and how they fish,  said Halpern, who also directs the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis(link is external) at UCSB.  That diversity creates both opportunities and challenges for sustainably managing the oceans. We unpacked this diversity to help guide better management.  Blue foods were found to rank more highly than terrestrial animal-source foods in terms of their nutritional benefits and potential for sustainability gains. Many blue food species are rich in important nutrients. Compared to chicken, trout has approximately 19 times more omega-3 fatty acids; oysters and mussels have 76 times more vitamin B-12 and five times more iron; and carps have nine times more calcium.  For the first time we got to see what more aquatic food production would mean for human health globally,  said Bren School marine ecologist and assistant researcher Christopher Free, who with fellow UCSB marine scientist Jacob Eurich co-authored a study that examines the nutritional potential of blue foods(link is external).  What we project is that by making aquatic foods cheaper to the consumer, there s likely going to be a shift away from land-based foods like chicken, beef and dairy. I think what made us really excited is knowing that aquatic food could be a useful solution to combating malnutrition, and really showing that comprehensively for the first time.  The nutritional benefits of blue foods are especially important for women, who were found to benefit more than men from increased consumption in nearly three times the number of countries studied. On average, the major species produced in aquaculture, such as tilapia, salmon, catfish and carp, were found to have environmental footprints comparable to chicken, the lowest-impact terrestrial meat. Small pelagic species like sardines and anchovies, bivalves and seaweeds all already offer lower stressors than chicken. Further investments to improve the sector s efficiency and reduce its environmental footprint can have sector-wide benefits, including for less commonly raised species like European bass, weakfish, flatfish, sea breams and milkfish. The research found that blue food systems facing the highest risk from climate change are also typically located in those regions where people rely on them most and where they are least equipped to respond and adapt to climate hazards.  Climate change is creating all sorts of risks to humanity, including to our food,  Halpern said.  Blue foods are no different and in fact face some unique risks from things like acidifying and warming waters. But not all foods are equally vulnerable to these risks   in our work we show where, how and why different blue foods face different risks from climate change.  These five papers are the first in a series produced by the Blue Food Assessment(link is external) (BFA), a group of more than 100 leading researchers led by Stanford University s Center for Ocean Solutions(link is external) & Center on Food Security and the Environment(link is external), the Stockholm Resilience Centre(link is external) at Stockholm University and EAT(link is external).  Blue foods are much more diverse than typically thought, and so too are the many communities of small-scale fishers who are often overlooked despite providing the majority of blue food people eat,  said Beatrice Crona, co-chair of the BFA and deputy science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre.  Few, if any, countries are developing their blue food sector to provide ecological, economic, and health benefits to its full potential,  said Rosamond Naylor, BFA co-chair and founding director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford University.  This assessment aims to provide the scientific foundation for decision-makers to evaluate trade-offs and implement solutions that will make blue foods an instrumental part of an improved food system from local to global scales.   The BFA assessment emphasizes the enormous diversity of blue foods, all of which carry important nutritional, cultural, economic and environmental value,  said Fabrice DeClerck, EAT science director.  To realize its potential, policymakers should put in place better governance, including participation of small producers, women and other marginalized groups, better stewardship of the natural resources on which blue foods rely; and investment in building resilience to climate change.   We are nine fishing seasons away from the deadline for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals so the urgency is high,  said Jim Leape, co-director of the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.  This research can help policymakers, companies, financiers, fishers and consumers capitalize on the immense potential of blue foods to help achieve those goals.  More than 2,500 species or species groups of fish, shellfish, aquatic plants and algae are caught or cultivated globally for food, providing livelihoods and incomes for more than 100 million and sustenance for one billion.

The ability to visualize cancerous tumors and metastatic tissue three-dimensionally (3D) can help clinicians diagnose the precise type and stage of cancer, while also informing the best treatment methods. To obtain an even clearer tissue for imaging, a research team based in Japan has tested the effectiveness of specialized hydrogels. Acting as a 3D molecular network, these hydrogels can rapidly remove fats from tissues, which are a factor in tissue opacification, without losing their structure. The material is used in several biomedical devices, including contact lenses.They published their results online on June 21 in Macromolecular Bioscience with the print edition issued on Sep. 16. Since 1981, the leading cause of death in Japan has been cancer,  said first author Chie Kojima, associate professor in the Department of Applied Chemistry in the Graduate School of Engineering at Osaka Prefecture University.  We need new treatment methods and diagnostic techniques. 3D fluorescence imaging is one such approach that could prove indispensable for understanding multicellular systems on the scale of an organ, as it can give us more information than traditional 2D imaging. This could be useful for personalized medicine in diagnosis, as well as elucidating biological phenomena. This type of imaging involves tagging certain molecular machines, such as proteins, so they fluoresce with different colors depending on what they are. The glowing signals can be viewed in a variety of samples, from whole organisms down to the cellular level. Most tissues are opaque, though, blocking the ability to see these signals. In 2D imaging, the samples are sliced thinly, which makes the signals easy to see but removes the ability to visualize the full system in 3D.Previously, researchers have used an approach known as CLARITY, in which the tissues are embedded in polyacrylamide hydrogels. The fats are removed from the tissues and the refractive index of the media is adjusted. The tagged glowing signals can be visualized in 3D, but it takes a month for the cancerous tissue to clear   far too long for a patient waiting for a diagnosis, according to Kojima. In that time, the tumor would have likely spread. The optical clearing process time in the CLARITY method needs to be shortened for practical applications,  Kojima said.To cut this time, the researchers used zwitterionic hydrogels, which are balanced in their charged molecules and hold the structure of tissue samples. Of several zwitterionic hydrogel combinations, the team found that polymer hydrogels that mimic fatty molecules on the tissue appear to optically clear tumor tissues the quickest. According to Kojima, the hydrogels are highly osmotic, which may help pull other fatty acids from the tissue. Blood vascular networks in murine brain tissues, as well as metastatic tumor tissues could be visualized in 3D using our system,  Kojima said.And they could visualize the tumor tissues quicker than in their previous attempts: what previously took a month could be achieved in a week with the improved approach.The researchers are continuing to explore the technique and how to apply it for diagnosing cancer in humans. We are attempting to apply our system for pathological diagnostics,  Kojima said.  We expect that it will be possible to diagnose a whole biopsy sample   instead of thin slices   which could prevent the oversight of small cancers.

The probes provide a shortcut by targeting, isolating and identifying the DNA sequences  specifically and simultaneously that are shared among related organisms, most often due to evolutionary history or ancestry.  There are thousands of bacterial pathogens and being able to determine which one is present in a patient s blood sample could lead to the correct treatment faster when time is very important,  explains Zachery Dickson, lead author of the study and a graduate student in the Department of Biology.  The probe makes identification much faster, meaning we could potentially save people who might otherwise die,  he says. Researchers also demonstrated the effectiveness of probes for capturing the incredibly wide array of pathogens associated with sepsis, a life-threatening and rapidly developing condition that occurs when the body overreacts to an infection which typically starts in the lungs, urinary tract, skin or gastrointestinal tract. We currently need faster, cheaper and more succinct ways to detect pathogens in human and environmental samples that democratize the hunt and this pipeline does exactly that, says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar, a lead author on the study and director of McMaster s Ancient DNA Centre.The discovery also holds promise for much broader applications for human health and scientific discovery, including the identification of intestinal parasites in ancient DNA, which could reveal new information on the evolution of catastrophic disease.Reference: Dickson ZW, Hackenberger D, Kuch M, et al.

That's how easy it is for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to enter yournose. And though remarkable progress has been made in developing intramuscular vaccines against SARS-CoV- 2, such as the readily available Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, nothing yet -- like a nasal vaccine -- has been approved to provide mucosal immunity in the nose, the first barrier against the virus before it travels down to the lungs.But now, we're one step closer. Navin Varadarajan, University of Houston M.D. Anderson Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and his colleagues, are reporting in iScience the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that provides durable local immunity against inhaled pathogens.""Mucosal vaccination can stimulate both systemic and mucosal immunity and has the advantage of being a non-invasive procedure suitable for immunization of large populations,"" said Varadarajan. ""However, mucosal vaccination has been hampered by the lack of efficient delivery of the antigen and the need for appropriate adjuvants that can stimulate a robust immune response without toxicity.""To solve those problems, Varadarajan collaborated with Xinli Liu, associate professor of pharmaceutics at the UH College of Pharmacy, and an expert in nanoparticle delivery. Liu's team was able to encapsulate the agonist of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) within liposomal particles to yield the adjuvant named NanoSTING. The function of the adjuvant is to promote the body's immune response.""NanoSTING has a small particle size around 100 nanometers which exhibits significantly different physical and chemical properties to the conventional adjuvant,"" said Liu.""We used NanoSTING as the adjuvant for intranasal vaccination and single-cell RNA-sequencing to confirm the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue as an inductive site upon vaccination. Our results show that the candidate vaccine formulation is safe, produces rapid immune responses -- within seven days -- and elicits comprehensive immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"" said Varadarajan.A fundamental limitation of intramuscular vaccines is that they are not designed to elicit mucosal immunity. As prior work with other respiratory pathogens like influenza has shown, sterilizing immunity to virus re-infection requires adaptive immune responses in the respiratory tract and the lung.The nasal vaccine will also serve to equitably distribute vaccines worldwide, according to the researchers. It is estimated that first world countries have already secured and vaccinated multiple intramuscular doses for each citizen while billions of people in countries like India, South Africa, and Brazil with large outbreaks are currently unimmunized. These outbreaks and viral spread are known to facilitate viral evolution leading to decreased efficacy of all vaccines.""Equitable distribution requires vaccines that are stable and that can be shipped easily. As we have shown, each of our components, the protein (lyophilized) and the adjuvant (NanoSTING) are stable for over 11 months and can be stored and shipped without the need for freezing,"" said Varadarajan.Varadarajan is co-founder of AuraVax Therapeutics Inc., a pioneering biotech company developing novel intranasal vaccines and therapies to help patients defeat debilitating diseases, including COVID-19. The company has an exclusive license agreement with UH with respect to the intellectual property covering intranasal vaccines and STING agonist technologies. They have initiated the manufacturing process and plan to engage the FDA later this year.Reference: An X, Martinez-Paniagua M, Rezvan A, et al.

Instead, the research suggests, launching an attack against the destructive chemicals the cancer is throwing off could increase survival rates and improve patients  health. It's a really complementary way of thinking about therapy,  said David Bilder, UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology.  You're trying to help the host deal with the effects of the tumor, rather than killing the tumor itself. Jung Kim, a postdoctoral fellow in Bilder s lab, recently discovered that tumors in fruit flies release a chemical that compromises the barrier between the bloodstream and the brain, letting the two environments mix   a recipe for disaster in numerous diseases, including infection, trauma and even obesity. In collaboration with the labs of UC Berkeley professors David Raulet and Kaoru Saijo, Kim and Bilder subsequently demonstrated that tumors in mice that release the same chemical, a cytokine called interleukin-6 (IL-6), also make the blood-brain barrier leaky.More importantly, they were able to extend the lifespan of both fruit flies and mice with malignant tumors by blocking the effect of the cytokine on the barrier. The IL-6 cytokine is known to cause inflammation. What's new here is that this tumor-induced inflammation is actually causing the blood-brain barrier to open. If we interfere with that opening process but leave the tumor alone, then the host can live significantly longer and healthier with the same tumor burden,  Bilder said.IL-6 plays other important roles in the body, so to benefit cancer patients, scientists would have to find a drug that blocks its action at the blood-brain barrier without altering its effects elsewhere. But such a drug could potentially extend the life span and health span of human cancer patients, he said.Six years ago, Bilder s team found that tumors in fruit flies also release a substance that blocks the effects of insulin, providing a potential explanation for the tissue wasting called cachexia that kills one-fifth of all cancer patients. That work is now being explored by numerous labs around the world.One advantage of helping the host fend off a tumor s effects on tissues far from the tumor site is that it could potentially reduce or even eliminate the need for toxic drugs typically used to subdue tumors. Such drugs also harm the patient, killing healthy cells as well as cancerous cells.Beyond these side effects, targeting tumor cells  also selects for resistance in the tumor, because the tumor has genetic variability   a drug-resistant clone arises that will then cause cancer recurrence,  he said.  But if you could target the host cells, they have a stable genome and are not going to gain resistance to these drugs. That s our goal: to understand the ways that the tumor is affecting the host and attack the host side of the tumor-host dialogue. Bilder and his colleagues published their work on IL-6 disruption of the blood-brain barrier last week in the journal Developmental Cell, and he authored a review of the impact that fruit fly research has had on understanding tumor-host interactions that was published last month in the journal Nature Reviews Cancer. Their cachexia work appeared in 2015 in Developmental Cell.","Published: September 17, 2021"

Neutrophils account for the largest portion (55-70%) of white blood cells in humans and fight against bacteria or fungi   and their lack causes abnormalities in the immune system. They usually circulate in the blood and move to sites where tissues are infected or inflamed. Recently, a POSTECH research team has developed a method for deciphering live neutrophils.Professor Young-Tae Chang of the Department of Chemistry at POSTECH (Associate director of Center for Self-assembly and Complexity, an Institute for Basic Science), Sun Hyeok Lee of the School of Convergence Science and Technology, and Min Gao of the Institute for Basic Science   in joint research with the Ulsan University Hospital   have reported the first fluorescent probe NeutropG for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils.*1 In recognition of its academic excellence, this study was published on August 19, 2021 in the international edition of Angewandte Chemie, a world-renowned chemistry journal. A fluorescent probe is a reporter that indicates whether a specific ion or substance is recognized by emitting a light signal. Identifying live neutrophils in humans is important not only for clinical diagnosis, but also for finding treatments for infections or inflammations. However, small molecule-based probes for differentiating live neutrophils among granulocytes have not been developed so far. Antibodies are useful in detecting specific cells, but those with low cell permeability have limitations in identifying biomarkers inside cells. Cell fixation and permeation processes are required to identify biomarkers, but when they undergo the pre-treatment process, their state becomes altered from the live state. These differences limit the selection of antibodies when studying live cells. To this, the research team tried to use the low-molecule fluorescent compound with relatively high cell permeability to overcome the shortcomings of antibodies. NeutropG, developed in this study, is selectively labeled on neutrophils through the lipid droplet biosynthesis*2, and occurs from the different rate of enzyme gene expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL)*3 and diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT).*4 It was confirmed that NeutropG changes into triacylglycerol (TAG), a component of the lipid droplet, by the action of these enzymes using a unique mechanism called the Metabolism-Oriented Live-cell Distinction (MOLD), which is completely different from the conventional Holding Oriented Live-cell Distinction (HOLD) or the Gating Oriented Live-cell Distinction (GOLD). NeutropG was used to observe the phagocytosis process of neutrophils and through this, the researchers proved that the staining can stay stable for a long time and does not significantly affect the native functions of neutrophils. This study has verified that NeutropG selectively stains healthy neutrophils and through its application, the researchers were able to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples. This high selectivity of neutrophil demonstrated the potential to be applicable in clinical diagnosis.  NeutropG is the first case for specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils in blood samples,  explained Professor Chang who led the study.  In particular, the metabolism-oriented live-cell distinction has the strength to selectively identify healthy neutrophils. ReferenceGao M, Lee SH, Park SH, et al.

These endocrine-disrupting chemicals do not break down when they are released into the environment, and they continue to accumulate over time. PFAS chemicals can affect pregnancy outcomes, the timing of puberty and other aspects of reproductive health.  Our findings are important because almost every human on the planet is exposed to PFAS. These man-made chemicals accumulate in our bodies and have detrimental effects on reproductive health,  said the study s first author Clara Amalie Gade Timmermann, Ph.D., assistant professor of the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Early unwanted weaning has been traditionally attributed to psychological factors, which are without a doubt important, but hopefully our research will help shift the focus and highlight that not all mothers can breastfeed despite good intentions and support from family and healthcare professionals.  The researchers analyzed blood samples for PFAS and prolactin concentrations from up to 1,286 pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort. The women provided information about the duration of breastfeeding in weekly text messages or questionnaires at three and eighteen months postpartum. The researchers found women with higher levels of PFAS in their system were 20% more likely to stop breastfeeding early.  Because breastfeeding is crucial to promote both child and maternal health, adverse PFAS effects on the ability to breastfeed may have long-term health consequences,  Timmermann said.ReferenceTimmermann CAG, Andersen MS, Budtz-J rgensen E, et al.

The innovation developed by the Lithuanian scientists can change the meat analogue industry offering a product that has less salt and saturated fats and more flavour than real meat. Millions of people worldwide suffer from digestive disorders. In the US alone, digestive diseases affect over 60 million people yearly according to NIDDK. Experts say that the probiotics produced during fermentation can help restore the balance of friendly bacteria and, by enhancing the number of free amino acids as well as minimising the effect of anti-mitogenic substances, may alleviate some digestive problems. Although fermented foods are rich in nutrients and fermentation can produce ingredients that improve smell and taste, the researchers from KTU Food Institute were among the few who relied on this process in meat analogue production.  Meat analogues are the future food. Both business and science will have to reconsider the effect of using secondary raw materials, and it will benefit all the parties by reducing costs and saving resources. We believe that science is the key to an efficient shift,  says one of the authors of the study, Dr Alvija  ala evi ien , the Director of KTU Food Institute.The group of researchers from KTU and the University of Helsinki produced meat analogues by adding fermented okara, the by-product of soy milk production, to the plant-based matrices. Okara samples were fermented by applying probiotics L. plantarum P1 and L. acidophilus 308 strains. The products containing different amounts of fermented okara modelled under different conditions were then evaluated. The study concluded that the use of fermentation makes okara a suitable component for meat analogues. According to the sensory and nutritional analysis, the optimum condition for producing meat analogues was the application of 6% okara in the matrices fermented by L. plantarum P1, when the matrices and okara are maturated at 4  C for 2 hours.  Meat industry has deep-rooted traditions and people possess a clear expectation how a pork or beef burger, chicken sausage or other meat product should look, smell, taste and feel like. That s why when modelling a meat analogue, we need to clearly identify what we are developing and what qualities it should have,  explains Dr  ala evi ien . For example, during the project EIT FOOD RIS CEL 2021 (KAVA (no 19153-21060.)) it was determined that although Lithuanian senior consumers are willing to use meat analogues produced from plant origin material, however, the sensory properties of the products that are currently available in the market are still less appealing in comparison with meat.According to researchers, there are many health-induced reasons for reducing meat consumption: it is hard to digest, the amounts of saturated fat raise  bad  cholesterol, also meat foods are usually over salted as fat reduces the flavour. Meat analogues with fermented okara have more free amino acids, which diminish the antinutritional factors, therefore are more easily digested than meat. Besides, the meat analogues modelled at KTU laboratories contain less fat and saturated fat but the same amount of protein   about 14-18% depending on different recipe variations.  Non-hydrogenated oils containing only small amounts of saturated fat were used while developing our products. Thanks to the small amount of fat we were able to create characteristic flavours by using only 1% of salt. Among the eleven ingredients used in our product are only natural spices, pigments and aromatic compounds, and no preservatives,  says Dr Gitana Alen ikien , senior researcher at KTU Food Institute, a co-author of the study. Currently, there are no commercialised meat analogue products with okara. However, the researchers are convinced that, as organic waste recycling is becoming more and more relevant in today s world, their modelled meat analogue will find its way to the market.Meat analogue with fermented okara is one of many products created by the researchers of KTU Food Institute. Recently, their pea-based meat analogue won the local innovation fair.  Both meat analogues are nutritionally valuable: our product with fermented okara is more easily digested and the pea-based meat analogue is enriched with iron, which is very important for the normal functioning of the human organism. While creating our products we aim to solve at least one nutritional problem   be it calorie control, lack of fibre or iron, or sluggish digestion process , explains Aelita Zabulion , a researcher at the KTU Food Institute. The meat analogues modelled at KTU laboratories contain less fat and saturated fat but the same amount of protein   about 14-18% depending on different recipe variations. The researchers emphasise   every new plant-based product widens the choice for consumers and can reduce the usage of processed meat products. Meat analogues enriched with fibre, microelements, vitamins, amino acids, processed to remove antinutrients from raw materials are, according to them, the future food. Reusing different organic waste such as okara for food production could be one of the most important challenges to solve.ReferenceRazavizadeh S et al.

Recent large-scale genetic studies revealed that genetic variants in a sodium channel, called voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, is a leading cause of autism. Overactive sodium channels in the neuron cause seizures. Doctors often treat seizures by giving the patient a medication meant to close the sodium channels, reducing the flow of sodium through axons. For many patients such treatment works, but in some cases   up to 20 or 30%   the treatment doesn t work. These children have  loss-of-function  variants in Nav1.2, which is expected to reduce the sodium channel activity as  anti-seizures . Thus, how the deficiency in sodium channel Nav1.2 leads to seizures is a major mystery in the field that puzzles physicians and scientists.Yang Yang, an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Purdue University, and his team, including first-author of the paper post-doctoral researcher Jingliang Zhang, tackled the issue. They discovered that in Nav1.2 deficient neurons, the expressions of many potassium channels are surprisingly reduced. The Nav1.2 deficiency itself doesn t cause seizures; the issue arises when the potassium channels over-compensate for the sodium channels  deficiency by shutting down too many potassium channels, making the neuron hyperexcitable, which causes seizures. In such cases, treating the sodium channel clearly does not work. Yang and his team suggest that developing medicines to open the potassium channels would help control seizures in these patients. Notably, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco led by Kevin Bender s research group made a similar observation independently. Yang and Bender s papers were published back-to-back in the same issue of Cell Reports.  We re looking at genetic makeup, so doctors can proscribe a drug and gene therapy based on genes identified   personalized medicines,  Yang said.  Our research points toward a direction for future research, maybe future treatments. We are peacetime warriors, fighting humanity s biggest enemy: disease. There are kids dying because of these conditions. Our goal is to help them, to help their parents and their families. This kind of basic research is a vital part of finding new drugs.

This discovery could lead to a new therapeutic approach, the scientists report in the journal ""Nucleic Acids Research"".Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a rare hereditary condition. It occurs when genetic changes disrupt the transmission of nerve signals from the brain to the muscles of the extremities, particularly those of the lower limbs. This leads to a gradual loss of muscle tissue in the lower legs. Early symptoms of the disease, which include pain and difficulties walking, usually appear in childhood and adolescence.

While we previously knew that the hallmark feature of people living with Alzheimer s disease was the progressive accumulation of toxic protein deposits within the brain called beta-amyloid, researchers did not know where the amyloid originated from, or why it deposited in the brain,  Professor Mamo said. Our research shows that these toxic protein deposits that form in the brains of people living with Alzheimer s disease most likely leak into the brain from fat carrying particles in blood, called lipoproteins. This  blood-to-brain pathway  is significant because if we can manage the levels in blood of lipoprotein-amyloid and prevent their leakage into the brain, this opens up potential new treatments to prevent Alzheimer s disease and slow memory loss. Building on previous award-winning research that showed beta-amyloid is made outside the brain with lipoproteins, Professor Mamo s team tested the ground-breaking  blood-to-brain pathway  by genetically engineering mouse models to produce human amyloid-only liver that make lipoproteins. As we predicted, the study found that mouse models producing lipoprotein-amyloid in the liver suffered inflammation in the brain, accelerated brain cell death and memory loss,  Professor Mamo said. While further studies are now needed, this finding shows the abundance of these toxic protein deposits in the blood could potentially be addressed through a person s diet and some drugs that could specifically target lipoprotein amyloid, therefore reducing their risk or slowing the progression of Alzheimer s disease. Alzheimer s WA Chairman Adjunct Professor Warren Harding said the findings may have a significant global impact for the millions of people living with Alzheimer s disease. Having universities like Curtin working with the pharmaceutical industry is important if we are to tackle this devastating disease,  Mr Harding said. In Australia, approximately 250 people are diagnosed with dementia daily, adding to the staggering half a million Australians who are already living with dementia. Without significant medical advances like the breakthrough Professor Mamo s team has made, it is estimated that the number of Australians living with dementia will exceed one million by 2058. This has a significant impact on families, carers and communities. Professor Mamo and his research team s previous research in this area was awarded the NHMRC-Marshall and Warren Award for the most innovative and potentially transformative research.Currently, the team is conducting a clinical trial, the Probucol in Alzheimer s-clinical trial, which is based on previous findings that a historic cardiovascular agent lowers lipoprotein-amyloid production and supports cognitive performance in mice. The mouse models used for this research were developed together with Ozgene.Reference: Lam V, Takechi R, Hackett MJ, et al.

Similarly, several observational studies found a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19, but it could be that these effects are confounded and in fact a result of other factors, such as obesity, older age or chronic illness which are also linked with low vitamin D.To overcome this, researchers were able to calculate  genetically-predicted  vitamin D level, that is not confounded by other demographic, health and lifestyle factors, by using the information from over one hundred genes that determine vitamin D status.The Mendelian Randomisation is a particular analytical approach that enabled researchers to investigate whether vitamin D and COVID-19 might be causally linked using genetic data. Few earlier studies attempted this but failed to show a causal link. This could be because UVB radiation sunshine which is the most important source of vitamin D for majority of people was ignored.What is unique about this research?Researchers, for the first time, looked at both genetically-predicted and UVB-predicted vitamin D level. Almost half a million individuals in the UK took part in the study, and ambient UVB radiation before COVID-19 infection was individually assessed for each participant. When comparing the two variables, researchers found that correlation with measured vitamin D concentration in the circulation was three-fold stronger for UVB-predicted vitamin D level, compared to genetically-predicted.What were the findings?Researchers found that ambient UVB radiation at an individual s place of residence preceding COVID-19 infection was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalisation and death. This suggests that vitamin D may protect against severe COVID-19 disease and death. Additionally, while the results from the Mendelian Randomisation analysis weren t conclusive, some indication of a potential causal effect was noted. Because of the relatively weak link between genetically-predicted vitamin D level that is used for Mendelian Randomisation analysis, it is possible that the number of cases in the current study was too small to convincingly determine causal effect, but future larger studies might provide the answer.Professor Lina Zgaga (pictured), Associate Professor in Epidemiology, School of Medicine, Trinity College and senior researcher on the study said: Our study adds further evidence that vitamin D might protect against severe COVID-19 infection. Conducting a properly designed COVID-19 randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation is critical. Until then, given that vitamin D supplements are safe and cheap, it is definitely advisable to take supplements and protect against vitamin D deficiency, particularly with winter on the horizon.  Professor Evropi Theodoratou, Professor of Cancer Epidemiology and Global Health, University of Edinburgh and senior researcher on the study said: Given the lack of highly effective therapies against COVID-19, we think it is important to remain open-minded to emerging results from rigorously conducted studies of vitamin D.  Dr Xue Li, a researcher on the study from Zhejiang University said: Our study supports the recommendation of vitamin D supplementation for not only the maintenance of bone and muscle health during the lock down, but also the potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.

A decreasing trend and low reproduction rates, combined with high levels of human activities   such as shipping and fisheries   underscore their precarious situation. Efficient tracking of their numbers, migration paths and habitat use is vital to lowering the number of preventable injuries and deaths and promoting their recovery.One of the frequently used methods to monitor whales is called passive acoustics technology. Right whales vocalize a variety of low-frequency sounds such as moans, groans, pulses and even belches. One typical vocalization they use to communicate with each other is referred to as an  up-call,  which is a short chirp or  whoop  that lasts about two seconds. Up-calls are narrowband vocalizations with frequency swings in the range of 50 to 440 Hertz and appear to function as signals that bring whales together.Although current passive acoustics technology is a reliable, safe and effective way to monitor these endangered leviathans, it hasn t always performed well. In the increasingly noisy ocean, current methods can mistake other sounds for whale calls. This high  false positive  rate hampers scientific research and hinders conservation efforts.Researchers from Florida Atlantic University s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and the College of Engineering and Computer Science used artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods to develop a new and much more accurate method of detecting Right whale up-calls. The technology utilizes Multimodal Deep Learning (MMDL) algorithms to evaluate acoustic recordings and make decisions on the presence of up-calls.The study s findings, published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, showed that the MMDL detector outperformed conventional machine learning methods and demonstrated the superiority of the MMDL algorithm in terms of the up-call detection rate, non-up-call detection rate, and false alarm rate. The autonomy of the MMDL detector has immediate application for effectively monitoring and protecting Right whales where accurate call detection of a low-density species is critical.  Our deep learning algorithm is a significant advancement on conventional machine learning methods. The near zero false-positive, false-negative and false alarm rates indicate that this new MMDL detector could be a powerful tool in the detection and monitoring of the low density, endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, especially in environments with high acoustic-masking,  said Laurent M. Ch rubin, Ph.D., senior author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch who worked with Ali K. Ibrahim, first author and a post-doctoral research associate at FAU Harbor Branch.  Since the attributes of the MMDL system are not signal specific, we believe that it can be used as a classifier for all applications in which multiple classes are involved. Researchers verified the effectiveness of the MMDL model for Right whale up-call detection with Cornell University s dataset. These recorded signals were converted to images and classified by the MMDL detector. The algorithm, composed of two types of neural networks, randomly selects its design parameters, requires little preprocessing and automates its architecture construction. Outputs from individual models are evaluated by a fusion classifier, which selects the most probable outcome.To highlight the urgency for effective detection and monitoring technologies in endangered species, new research is indicating that whales and other marine species are being impacted by climate change, including shifts in migration patterns and habitat use. Recently, North Atlantic Right Whales have been observed in locations not previously known as important Right whale habitat. The new MMDL system offers a new tool to effectively monitor and assess the importance of these new behaviors in a changing ocean.Reference: Ibrahim AK, Zhuang H, Ch rubin LM, Erdol N, O Corry-Crowe G, Ali AM.

Repeated replication can lead to viral strains that show attenuated virulence. Such strains may act as vaccines if the attenuated virus can produce immunity without serious disease.This approach is not new. Albert Sabin developed an attenuated poliovirus vaccine in the mid-20th century that helped eradicate naturally occurring polio in the Western Hemisphere. Attenuated viral vaccines for rubella, measles, yellow fever and other diseases are widely used.Can a similar vaccine be developed for COVID-19?Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have published a foundational study for that possibility in the Journal of Virology. They asked a simple question: Which mutations predominate when the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is grown in successive generations   called passages by virologists   in tissue culture?The UAB researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 isolates rapidly adapted as they grew in repeated passages in Vero E6 cells, a strain of kidney cells that is commonly used for virus propagation. The evolved viruses gained higher infectivity, demonstrated more rapid infection spread and made dramatically larger plaques on Vero cells. A plaque is a visible fragment of the cell layer where cells are destroyed by viral multiplication and release.For one of the SARS-CoV-2 strains tested by UAB researchers   a strain from Washington state that was the first COVID-19 virus detected in the United States at the start of 2020   the average number of infectious virus particles released from the cells was 100-fold less than the number of infectious particles released after four passages.The researchers, led by Ilya Frolov, Ph.D., professor in the UAB Department of Microbiology, found that viral evolution developed by two major mechanisms. The first was an insertion of seven amino acids, including two positively charged amino acids, into the spike protein of the Washington SARS-CoV-2 isolate. The virus uses its spike proteins to attach to ACE2 receptors on cells, triggering its entry into the cell. Thus, the spike protein is a major determinant of pathogenesis.The second mechanism was a change of one amino acid from serine to glycine, a mutation called S686G, in the spike protein near its cleavage site. Both mechanisms increased the ability of the mutant to bind to heparan sulfate, which is abundantly present on the surface of cells. The two changes also increased plaque size and rate of infection spread. That binding to heparan sulfate on the cellular membrane appears to be the mechanism of primary attachment of the virus before the high affinity interaction of the spike with the cellular ACE2 receptor. As a test of biological significance, solutions of heparin   a related polysaccharide   inhibited the infectivity of the mutant viruses that show increased binding to heparan sulfate, while heparin did not reduce the infectivity of non-mutant viruses.To test the independent effects of the two major mechanisms, the UAB researchers cloned each change into DNA that was a copy of the genome of the first Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 isolate sequenced in January 2020. RNA copies produced from these DNA constructs were delivered into cells, and the cells then produced the virus. Researchers found that each single mechanism increased the binding of the constructs to heparan sulfate, and a double-mutant construct with both changes had significantly higher infection rates than either single mutant. An important characteristic of the double mutant is that its further evolution in cultured cells appears to be unlikely,  Frolov said. He says the recombinant single mutants continued to accumulate various second-site mutations in further passages, while the double mutant that contained both the amino acid insertion and S686G was stable and did not acquire additional changes.Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA coronavirus. Alphaviruses are also positive-strand RNA viruses. Others have shown that the alphaviruses chikungunya, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Ross River and Sindbis showed similar rapid evolution during growth in cell culture, including increased plaque size, a stronger interaction with heparan sulfate and a stimulated spread of infection.Importantly, these evolved alphaviruses were usually dramatically less pathogenic in mice and humans. As with the heparan sulfate-binding mutants of other RNA+ viruses, the evolved SARS-CoV-2 may also be attenuated in vivo, particularly the double mutant that demonstrates the most adapted phenotype,  Frolov said.  Thus, they may also be used as a basis for development of stable live attenuated vaccines for COVID-19. Reference: Shiliaev Nikita, Lukash Tetyana, Palchevska Oksana, et al.

The findings could result in potential new targets for drug development. More than 34 million Americans have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and approximately 90-95% of them have Type 2 diabetes. One of the main risk factors is environmental toxicant exposure, particularly chronic exposure to arsenic, which has been shown to affect insulin production and sensitivity, blood sugar levels, and lipid profiles, all common features of diabetes onset and progression. Because arsenic is a natural metalloid found in soil, it can be one of the most significant contaminants in drinking water globally, especially when ingested at unsafe levels. Arsenic is present in almost all groundwater sources in Arizona, particularly in rural areas. Combined with occupational exposures, such as mining, more than 160 million people worldwide are exposed to arsenic. New research led by Donna D. Zhang, PhD, the Musil Family Endowed Chair in Drug Discovery at the UArizona College of Pharmacy and a member of the BIO5 Institute, uncovered a biological mechanism by which chronic arsenic exposure led to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, two key features of diabetes progression. The study examined the effect of arsenic exposure on nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (NRF2) activation. NRF2 is a protein that plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostatis, especially during times of oxidative stress when there is an imbalance of free oxygen radicals and antioxidants in the body. Long-term oxidative stress, such as that caused by cigarette smoke, radiation, diets high in sugar, fat and alcohol, or environmental toxins, contributes to the development of a range of chronic conditions including cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. NRF2 is the body s governing regulator against oxidative stress. When the body enters an oxidative stress state, NRF2 is activated and the process of cellular protection begins. When cellular homeostatis is restored, NRF2 levels return to normal. Dr. Zhang and the research team found that arsenic exposure results in the prolonged and uncontrolled activation of NRF2, which previously was determined to be a driver of cancer progression and resistance to anti-cancer therapy. In this study, they found that arsenic exposure resulted in glucose intolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity. In particular, prolonged NRF2 activation by chronic arsenic exposure caused shifts in pathways that control amino acid, fatty acid, carbohydrate, lipid and drug metabolism. The findings demonstrated that prolonged NRF2 activation in response to arsenic increased glucose production in the liver and the release of that glucose to the bloodstream, which could represent a key driver of changes in systemic blood glucose.  Hopefully this study will serve as a foundation for future toxicant-driven diabetes research here at the University of Arizona Health Sciences and elsewhere,  said Dr. Zhang, who also is an associate director of the UArizona Superfund Research Center.  Our eventual goal is to generate effective preventive or interventive strategies to treat exposed populations. ReferenceLiu P, Dodson M, Li H, et al.

With very limited treatment options, scientists are looking for ways to understand the disease better. One hallmark of AD is the emergence of so-called beta-amyloid plaques, clumps of beta-amyloid protein accumulating in the brain and thought to be toxic to adjacent neurons. The causes for Alzheimer s disease and the formation of beta-amyloid plaques are still largely unknown but genetic studies found that a gene called APOE, which is involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport, is linked to AD in the elderly. The APOE gene exists in different versions in people, APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4, but the APO4 gene comes with a relatively higher risk of developing AD.Curiously, in the brain, it s mostly the supporting cells called astrocytes rather than the neurons that make ApoE protein. To find out if the APOE4 gene in astrocytes relates to AD, Jinsoo Seo and colleagues with the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), South Korea, used human-induced stem cells carrying different versions of the APOE gene to make neurons and astrocytes in the lab, and to study their interaction. The researchers found that astrocytes carrying the AD-associated APOE4 gene released more cholesterol than astrocytes with APOE3.The scientists noticed that the neurons exposed to higher cholesterol had distinct changes to their cell membranes, the outer layers of the cell which normally contain cholesterol. Further, this high cholesterol content in cell membranes was directly related to the increased production and secretion of beta-amyloid by the neurons. This work illustrates how different versions of the APOE gene in astrocytes can influence beta-amyloid production in neurons, and how cholesterol oversupply from ApoE4 astrocytes might promote the formation of toxic beta-amyloid plaques in AD patients.Reference: Lee S-I, Jeong W, Lim H, et al.

Their biodegradable plasterboard, Breathaboard uses compostable crop waste instead of gypsum, is lighter and has better thermal and acoustic insulation compared with traditional plasterboard.Microbiologists from the University of Bath s Department of Biology & Biochemistry, and concrete experts from the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering have been awarded funding by the National Biofilms Innovation Centre (NBIC), for a six-month pilot project that aims to optimise the properties of the prototype plasterboard using their bacteria-based construction technology (BBCT). If successful, the plasterboard can be scaled up and developed further. Dr Susanne Gebhard, Senior Lecturer in the University s Department of Biology and Biochemistry and the Milner Centre for Evolution, is leading the project in collaboration with Professor Kevin Paine from the University s Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering. She said:  Biofilms are formed when bacteria stick together to coat a surface, as opposed to growing neat dot-shaped clumps on a petri dish.  This is a really exciting project that will see whether we can exploit the natural biofilm-forming abilities of bacteria to function as a kind of glue that will help improve the properties of biodegradable construction materials.  Jeff Ive, Technical Director at Adaptavate, said:  Gypsum is the third most used construction material and accounts for 3% of UK carbon emissions.  It s either mined or produced from waste from coal power stations and is becoming increasingly expensive to produce. As it s calcium sulphate based, it also needs to be disposed of carefully so it doesn t harm the environment.  Our Breathaboard is a low carbon sustainable alternative to gypsum based plasterboard and could make a real difference to the carbon emissions of the construction industry.

Most of these infections occur in school-age and pre-school children.The clinical trial in Malawi was led by Professor Melita Gordon of the University of Liverpool and the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust (MLW) Clinical Research Programme, in partnership with the Blantyre Malaria Project (BMP) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine s (UMSOM) Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD).Professor Gordon said:  Our only real option to controlling these new resistant strains of typhoid in a timely way is through the vaccine. The TCV efficacy data are the first from Africa and offer great promise for the control of this deadly disease across the continent. It is particularly significant that this vaccine is a great tool not only to control typhoid disease itself, but also to combat the international spread of antimicrobial resistance. The burden of disease in younger, pre-school children has previously been rather overlooked, so it is especially important and encouraging that we have shown in this trial that TCV works well in pre-school as well as school-age children. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended TCV for children six months of age and older in typhoid endemic settings. The new study found that the vaccine prevented typhoid in Malawi   where the incidence of typhoid is high. This helps to pave the way for additional countries to introduce TCV, making it available to all children.The analysis included more than 28,000 children aged 9 months to 12 years in Blantyre, Malawi   half received TCV and half received the control, group-A meningococcal (MenA) vaccine. Blood tests performed on children with febrile illness occurring at least two weeks after receiving a study vaccine confirmed typhoid in 10 children in the TCV group and 61 who received MenA over a period of 18-24 months. TCV was effective in all age groups, including children under five years of age.Typhoid is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and is a serious threat in many low- and middle-income countries. While typhoid is treatable, the effects can go beyond illness and death. Typhoid can impair physical and cognitive development in children, affect school attendance and performance, limit productivity, and reduce earning potential.Dr Queen Dube, Chief of Health Services from the Malawi Ministry of Health, said:  Typhoid is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. It places a large health, financial and social burden on families and especially on children in Malawi. Malawi s Ministry of Health is excited about the results of the typhoid conjugate vaccine trial   it will bring great relief, will save lives, prevent morbidity, and help make the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals a reality across the continent. Malawi will now roll out the TCV vaccine nationally, starting with a mass campaign for all children aged 9 months through to 15 years, followed by introduction into the national Expanded Programme of Immunisation, from 2022 onwards.Professor Henry Mwandumba, Acting Director of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme added:  The outcome of the typhoid vaccine trial bears testament to what can be achieved through global research collaboration. I would like to thank all partners and trial participants for this truly excellent work, which will have lasting health benefits around the world. The study is part of the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC)   a larger effort led by CVD, the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, and PATH. TyVAC aims to accelerate the introduction of TCV as part of an integrated approach to reduce the burden of typhoid in countries eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. TCVs have the potential to protect millions of children disproportionately impacted by typhoid. We hope these much-needed data catalyze additional countries to introduce this lifesaving vaccine,  said Kathleen Neuzil, MD, MPH, the Myron M. Levine, MD, DTPH, Professor in Vaccinology at UMSOM. Dr. Neuzil is also the Director of CVD and Chief Investigator for the TyVAC consortium.Reference: Patel PD, Patel P, Liang Y, et al.

There is great potential for these sensors to be used in connected, low-cost devices for homes, or integrated in wearable devices used to monitor human health. Most people spend much of their lives inside homes, cars, or work environments, so the ability to cheaply and accurately monitor levels of pollutants, for example, could be a game-changer within a health and wellbeing context. The work was led by Larisa Florea, Assistant Professor in Trinity s School of Chemistry, and Principal Investigator at AMBER, in collaboration with Louise Bradley, Professor in Trinity s School of Physics, and carried out in CRANN, the Trinity Centre for Research on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices. An industrial collaborator and leader in the field of gas sensing, Dr Radislav Potyrailo from GE Research, Niskayuna New York, has also been involved throughout. The team s results have just been published as part of a Special Issue showcasing Professor Florea s work as an Emerging Investigator in the Journal of Materials Chemistry C. It can be read, open access here. Lead author of the journal article, Dr Colm Delaney, from Trinity s School of Chemistry and Research Fellow at AMBER, said,  More than 300 years ago, Robert Hooke first investigated the vibrant colours on a peacock s wing. Only centuries later did scientists discover that the effervescent colouration was caused not by traditional pigments but by the interaction of light with tiny objects on the feather, objects which were just a few millionths of a metre in size.  We have taken this biological design, seen all the way from a magpie to a chameleon, to make some really exciting materials. We achieve this by using a technique known as Direct laser-writing (DLW), which allows us to focus a laser into an extremely small spot, and to then use it to make tiny structures in three dimensions from the soft polymers which we develop in the lab.  Collaborator on the project, Professor of Photonics at Trinity, Louise Bradley, a funded investigator at AMBER, added,  The research we carry out between the two groups focuses on design, modelling, and fabrication of these tiny structures in stimuli-responsive materials. Jing Qian, a fantastic PhD student in my lab has spent a lot of time developing designs, and predicting the response of different structures, which we can have respond to light, heat, and humidity to create systems which can truly recreate the vividness, stealth response, and camouflaging ability found in nature. The tiny responsive arrays, which are smaller than a freckle, can be used to tell us an enormous amount about the chemistry of their environment. While traditional physical sensors have bolstered a connected-living market, there exists a lag in low-cost, adaptable chemical-sensing platforms that can be used. Photonic sensors have made considerable inroads into yielding accurate and robust alternatives, with minimal power consumption, low operating costs and high sensitivity. This is an area that Dr Potyrailo and GE Research have worked on commercialising for many years. Professor Larisa Florea, from Trinity s School of Chemistry and AMBER, said,  We have created responsive, printed, microscopic optical structures which can be monitored in real-time, and used for the detection of gases. The ability to print such an optically responsive material has profound potential for their incorporation into connected, low-cost sensing devices for homes, or into wearable devices for monitoring analytes.  We spend the majority of our lives inside our homes, cars, or work environments. Models suggest that the concentration of pollutants can be anywhere from 5-100 times the concentration found outside. This is a haunting thought when we consider that the World Health Organisation suggests 90% of the world s population lives in areas which exceed acceptable air standard limits. These pollutants can be influenced by ambient air, chemical presence, fragrances, food quality, and human activity and have a profound effect on our health.  To date, indoor gas sensors have focused almost solely on leak, smoke, and carbon dioxide detection. Even iterative advances, to include relative humidity, oxygen levels, carbon dioxide, volatile organic carbons (VOCs), and ammonia in a real-time manner could play an enormous role in the development of a domestic environmental monitoring ecosystem. This could ensure that health and wellbeing monitoring become central to the future of home building and automation. ReferenceDelaney C, Qian J, Zhang X, Potyrailo R, Bradley AL, Florea L.

The radiocarbon analysis typically used to reconstruct past human demographic changes relies on a method easily skewed by radiocarbon calibration curves and measurement uncertainty. And there s never been a statistical fix that works   until now. Nobody has systematically explored the problem, or shown how you can statistically deal with it,  says SFI Applied Complexity Fellow Michael Price, lead author on a paper in the Journal of Archaeological Science about a new method he developed for summarizing sets of radiocarbon dates.  It s really exciting how this work came together. We identified a fundamental problem and fixed it.  In recent decades, archaeologists have increasingly relied on sets of radiocarbon dates to reconstruct past population size through an approach called  dates as data.  The core assumption is that the number of radiocarbon samples from a given period is proportional to the region s population size at that time. Archaeologists have traditionally used  summed probability densities,  or SPDs, to summarize these sets of radiocarbon dates.  But there are a lot of inherent issues with SPDs,  says Julie Hoggarth, Baylor University archaeologist and a co-author on the paper. Radiocarbon dating measures the decay of carbon-14 in organic matter. But the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere fluctuates through time; it s not a constant baseline. So researchers create radiocarbon calibration curves that map the carbon-14 values to dates. Yet a single carbon-14 value can correspond to different dates   a problem known as  equifinality,  which can naturally bias the SPD curves.  That s been a major issue,  and a hurdle for demographic analyses, says Hoggarth.  How do you know that the change you re looking at is an actual change in population size, and it isn t a change in the shape of the calibration curve?  When she discussed the problem with Price several years ago, he told her he wasn t a fan of SPDs, either. She asked what archaeologists should do instead.  Essentially, he said,  Well, there is no alternative.  That realization led to a years-long quest. Price has developed an approach to estimating prehistoric populations that uses Bayesian reasoning and a flexible probability model that allows researchers to overcome the problem of equifinality. The approach also allows them to combine additional archaeological information with radiocarbon analyses to get a more accurate population estimate. He and his team applied the approach to existing radiocarbon dates from the Maya city of Tikal, which has extensive prior archaeological research.  It serves as a really good test case,  says Hoggarth, a Maya scholar. For a long time, archaeologists debated two demographic reconstructions: Tikal s population spiked in the early Classic period and then plateaued, or it spiked in the late Classic period. When the team applied the new Bayesian algorithm,  it showed a really steep population increase associated with the late Classic,  she says,  so that was really wonderful confirmation for us.  The authors produced an open-source package that implements the new approach, and website links and code are included in their paper.  The reason I m excited for this,  Price says,  is that it s pointing out a mistake that matters, fixing it, and laying the groundwork for future work.  This paper is just the first step. Next, through  data fusion,  the team will add ancient DNA and other data to radiocarbon dates for even more reliable demographic reconstructions.  That s the long-term plan,  Price says. And it could help resolve a second issue with the dates as data approach: a  bias problem  if and when radiocarbon dates are skewed toward a particular time period, leading to inaccurate analyses. But that s a topic for another paper.ReferencePrice MH, Capriles JM, Hoggarth JA, Bocinsky RK, Ebert CE, Jones JH. End-to-end Bayesian analysis for summarizing sets of radiocarbon dates.

According to recent research results, they are also able to reduce concentrations of potentially harmful bacteria in seawater: A study now published by researchers from Kiel draws attention this additional ecosystem service that seagrass meadows provide to humans. The findings provide yet another reason for the protection and restoration of these long-underrated ecosystems in the German Baltic Sea.It has been known for some time that seagrass meadows absorb nutrients and are thus able to prevent over-fertilization and algal blooms. In addition, their important role as a marine carbon sink is also increasingly being recognized, which means they can minimise the greenhouse effect. In a study now published in the journal Marine Biology, a team of researchers from GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel demonstrates that native seagrass meadows can also improve water quality with respect to potentially harmful bacteria: Water from the densely vegetated submarine areas contains fewer vibrios   naturally occurring bacteria that can be harmful to health in high concentrations. At five locations in the Bay of Kiel, divers collected water samples from overgrown and non-vegetated sandy bottoms. In the laboratory, these were placed on a plate prepared with a nutrient solution. After a few days the Vibrio colonies that formed were counted. The analyses showed that water from seagrass beds contained an average of 39 percent fewer vibrios and 63 percent fewer of the potentially harmful Vibrio vulnificus/cholerae type compared to non-vegetated areas. The underlying mechanism will be studied in more detail in the future.  It is plausible that the increased sedimentation in the dense meadow increases the settling of fine particles, to which vibrions also adhere,  explains Professor Thorsten Reusch, marine biologist at GEOMAR and leader of the study.  But it could also be that chemical substances from the seagrass leaves prevent the growth of the bacteria.   Our pilot study was motivated by a 2017 Science publication that showed a reduction of coral and human pathogens for tropical meadows wherever dense seagrass meadows grow between human settlements and reefs,  Prof. Thorsten Reusch adds.  Now we have been able to demonstrate similar functions of our native waters for the first time.  The new results are of particular importance because all climate models predict above-average warming in the future in combination with a sweetening of the Baltic Sea.  These are exactly the environmental conditions that will lead to the further spread of vibrios also on beaches used for swimming in summer,  said Professor Ute Hentschel Humeida, microbiologist at GEOMAR and co-author of the publication. The study also highlights the crucial importance of seagrass beds as a nature-based solution for the health of shallow water ecosystems and their water quality. Thus, it provides further incentives for the protection and restoration of these long underestimated coastal ecosystems.ReferenceReusch TBH, Schubert PR, Marten S-M, et al.

Since exosomes exhibit a naturally derived composition and function as intercellular communication tools, they have great potential as smart vehicles for cargo delivery.However, the commonly used methods for preparing exosomes that can carry desired cargo suffer from low loading efficiency and excessive damage to both exosomes and their cargo.In this study, Prof. YANG's group proposed a high-throughput nanofluidic device called an ""exosome nanoporator (ENP),"" which can load a variety of exogenous cargo into exosomes.The ENP can accurately control the characteristics of fluid in nanoscale by nanofluidic technology, so as to realize highly controllable preparation conditions for exosome-based drug delivery vehicles.Moreover, the researchers manufactured nanofluidic channels with precise geometries, enabling 30,000 modules working in parallel in a single device.By transporting exosomes through the nanochannels, exosome membranes are permeabilized by mechanical compression and fluid shear, generating transient nanopores on the exosome membranes and allowing an influx of cargo molecules into exosomes from the surrounding solution while maintaining exosome integrity.The researchers selected a clinically approved chemotherapeutic antitumor drug, i.e., doxorubicin hydrochloride, as the cargo model, and confirmed that the ENP could efficiently load it into exosomes. ""We found that the exosomes treated by the ENP can deliver their drug cargos to human non-small cell lung cancer cells and induce cell death. This indicates potential opportunities for the device to develop new exosome-based delivery vehicles for medical and biological applications,"" said Prof. YANG.In the future, this new strategy is expected to develop into a platform to load different exogenous substances with biological significance and clinical therapeutic effects into exosomes.Reference: Hao R, Yu Z, Du J, et al.

A study by the University of Basel has shown that it may be possible to improve the therapeutic effects by additionally inhibiting a specific signaling pathway. The results are so convincing that they are already being incorporated into clinical studies in a  bench-to-bedside  approach.In myeloproliferative neoplasms, a form of chronic leukemia, the body constantly produces too many blood cells such as erythrocytes, platelets and granulocytes. This may lead to thrombosis, enlarged spleen and constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, bone pain and fatigue. The disease affects around one in a hundred thousand adults per year and, in the worst case, ends in acute leukemia with a short life expectancy.The disease is triggered by mutations that cause the JAK2 tyrosine kinase to be permanently active, instead of only being activated when needed. This means that the bone marrow constantly receives signals to produce new blood cells.

However, if this lining, called the endometrium, is too thin, the embryo can t latch on. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering have developed a new system intended to treat infertility in women with thin endometria. Their tiny, micro-scale particles stimulated blood vessel growth, producing promising results in preliminary experiments in cells and mice. Poor blood flow within the endometrium limits its thickness, and researchers have struggled to find an effective way to encourage the formation of new blood vessels. Some have begun exploring the use of microspheres to deliver treatment. However, current methods for making these tiny particles face challenges, including the need for complex, demanding production methods and too much variation in the sizes of the spheres. So, Xiangguo Wang, Lei Yang and their colleagues wanted to devise a simple, efficient technique for manufacturing uniform microspheres loaded with a compound known to be a potent stimulator of blood vessel growth.  To formulate their tiny particles, the researchers looked to hyaluronic acid, a substance known to contribute to the growth of the endometrium. Using a method called electrospray, they generated hyaluronic acid-containing droplets that were all very similar in size, about 400  m in diameter. They then collected the droplets and stuck them together with an ultraviolet light treatment. By manipulating the composition of the spheres, the researchers found they could alter their ability to take up and release drugs. They then loaded the particles up with their second active ingredient: the blood vessel-promoting compound called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In experiments with female mice with thin endometria, they found that microspheres containing only the hyaluronic acid produced some thickening of the tissue compared to the control, but VEGF-carrying spheres generated the most thickening. While promising, this system needs further safety testing, note the researchers. They add that limits on the spheres  drug releasing ability may make multiple treatments necessary for fertility patients.

The researchers also show that this strong immune memory lasted in all age groups tested, including in people over age 70, a demographic especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

The treatment not only slowed tumor growth in the lungs of mice with either metastatic breast cancer or melanoma, it also prevented or drastically minimized the spread of these cancers to the lungs of healthy mice that were challenged with the disease.The research was published Sept. 14 in the journal Advanced Science.Cancer spread to the lungs is one of the most common forms of metastasis in various cancers. Once there, it is extremely deadly and difficult to treat.Researchers at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering developed an experimental treatment that combats this spread. It involves a bodily injection of a plant virus called the cowpea mosaic virus. The virus is harmless to animals and humans, but it still registers as a foreign invader, thus triggering an immune response that could make the body more effective at fighting cancer.The idea is to use the plant virus to help the body s immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells in the lungs. The virus itself is not infectious in our bodies, but it has all these danger signals that alarm immune cells to go into attack mode and search for a pathogen, said Nicole Steinmetz, professor of nanoengineering at UC San Diego and director of the university s Center for Nano-ImmunoEngineering.To draw this immune response to lung tumors, Steinmetz s lab engineered nanoparticles made from the cowpea mosaic virus to target a protein in the lungs. The protein, called S100A9, is expressed and secreted by immune cells that help fight infection in the lungs. And there is another reason that motivated Steinmetz s team to target this protein: overexpression of S100A9 has been observed to play a role in tumor growth and spread. For our immunotherapy to work in the setting of lung metastasis, we need to target our nanoparticles to the lung,  said Steinmetz.  Therefore, we created these plant virus nanoparticles to home in on the lungs by making use of S100A9 as the target protein. Within the lung, the nanoparticles recruit immune cells so that the tumors don t take. Because these nanoparticles tend to localize in the lungs, they can change the tumor microenvironment there to become more adept at fighting off cancer not just established tumors, but future tumors as well,  said Eric Chung, a bioengineering Ph.D. student in Steinmetz s lab who is one of the co-first authors on the paper.To make the nanoparticles, the researchers grew black-eyed pea plants in the lab, infected them with cowpea mosaic virus, and harvested the virus in the form of ball-shaped nanoparticles. They then attached S100A9-targeting molecules to the surfaces of the particles.The researchers performed both prevention and treatment studies. In the prevention studies, they first injected the plant virus nanoparticles into the bloodstreams of healthy mice, and then later injected either triple negative breast cancer or melanoma cells in these mice. Treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in the cancers spreading to their lungs compared to untreated mice.In the treatment studies, the researchers administered the nanoparticles to mice with metastatic tumor in their lungs. These mice exhibited smaller lung tumors and survived longer than untreated mice.What s remarkable about these results, the researchers point out, is that they show efficacy against extremely aggressive cancer cell lines.  So any change in survival or lung metastasis is pretty striking,  said Chung.  And the fact that we get the level of prevention that we do is really, really amazing. Steinmetz envisions that such a treatment could be especially helpful to patients after they have had a cancerous tumor removed.  It wouldn t be meant as an injection that s given to everyone to prevent lung tumors. Rather, it would be given to patients who are at high risk of their tumors growing back as a metastatic disease, which often manifests in the lung. This would offer their lungs protection against cancer metastasis,  she said.Before the new treatment can reach that stage, the researchers need to do more detailed immunotoxicity and pharmacology studies. Future studies will also explore combining this with other treatments such as chemotherapy, checkpoint drugs or radiation.Reference: Chung YH, Park J, Cai H, Steinmetz NF.

These multi-component molecular machines build complex proteins by stitching building blocks together according to instructions encoded in the cell s messenger RNAs. But ribosomes are themselves composed of small and large subunits, each of which is made up of ribosomal proteins and RNA. Before they can manufacture proteins, these subunits must be manufactured themselves. In a new study, scientists in the lab of Sebastian Klinge provide the most detailed view of how human small ribosomal subunits are put together by capturing their 3D portraits at three different stages of the assembly process. The findings are published in Science.   The assembly of a ribosome is like an origami,  says Klinge, associate professor and head of the Laboratory of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry.  Segments of RNA and other proteins have to be accurately folded in precise steps. The fundamental problem we are trying to understand is how proteins known as assembly factors work in concert to control each step of the assembly.  For the study, the researchers developed a human gene-editing platform to tag ribosome assembly factors and established a novel biochemical procedure to overcome the hurdle of extracting the pre-ribosomal particles from the nucleolus, a structure inside the cell s nucleus. These particles were then imaged using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing their structure at near atomic resolution.  The findings detail how some 70 assembly factors come together to create a scaffolding for the construction of the small subunit, and to guide each step of its maturation. Once their job is done, the assembly factors break apart, liberating the mature small subunit they held inside.  The three stages captured in the study provide a better understanding of the key molecular mechanisms that bring about the formation of the small subunit. The findings also provide new insights into rare human diseases that result from mutations in ribosomal proteins or assembly factors during the assembly of ribosomes.

The myoblasts were senescent, meaning they were no longer able to divide and grow.The overexpression ameliorated some of the primary characteristics associated with age-related deterioration of cells, including autophagy, energy homeostasis, genomic stability, nuclear integrity and mitochondrial function.Most notably, NANOG increased the number of muscle stem cells in the muscle of prematurely aging mice. This demonstrated the feasibility of reversing cellular aging in the body without the need to reprogram cells to an embryonic pluripotent state, a process that s often used in stem cell therapy but runs the risk of tumorigenesis. Our work focuses on understanding the mechanisms of NANOG s actions in hopes of discovering druggable targets in signaling or metabolic networks that mimic the anti-aging effects of NANOG. Ultimately, the work could help lead to new treatments or therapies that help reverse cellular senescence, and aid the many people suffering from age-related disorders,  says the study s corresponding author Stelios T.

The glyphosate sensor uses technology that is similar to that used in glucose tests that can quickly measure blood sugar levels from a pinprick of blood. Ultimately, that is the goal for this sensor: to test human samples for monitoring glyphosate exposure, but in the study published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics, researchers first showed the sensor s potential for testing beverages.  We started to develop this sensor for health monitoring, but it also can be used for food safety and environmental monitoring,  said Yuehe Lin, professor in WSU s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and the study s corresponding author.  We designed it to be portable and used 3D-printing to make it small and compact, so that it can be used anywhere in the lab or in the field.  Before this new development, methods of detecting and measuring herbicides like glyphosate often relied on meticulous preparation of samples and expensive scientific equipment like mass spectrometers. Other methods involve using biological antibodies to attract and bind the herbicide molecules, which is also expensive with materials that need to be carefully stored to prevent degradation of the natural components. The sensor developed by the research team uses electrically conducting polymer nanotubes that are imprinted with molecule-sized cavities that can bind glyphosate molecules   essentially mimicking the biological antibodies. These nanotubes are then coated on a 3D-printed sensor device that uses an electric current to quantify the glyphosate concentration. Because it uses an artificial antibody instead of biological one, the sensor doesn t need special storage, and the sensing materials are relatively inexpensive. The researchers tested the sensor on samples of orange juice and rice beverages that they spiked with known levels of glyphosate. They found the sensor had the ability to detect the herbicide with high sensitivity and specificity.  For the next step, we want to use the sensor to detect glyphosate in some human samples such as blood, saliva or urine,  said Shichao Ding, a WSU doctoral candidate in Lin s lab and first author on the paper.  We will also continue to develop some new nanomaterials to enhance its sensing performance.  Glyphosate has been approved for use by many regulatory agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which issued a statement in 2020 that it is safe for use at recommended levels. Yet, some groups and studies have raised concerns about glyphosate s health and environmental risks, and the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified it as  probably carcinogenic to humans.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-brain-overcomes-uncertainty-to-plan-motor-actions-353669,The Brain Overcomes Uncertainty To Plan Motor Actions In baseball  batters have roughly    milliseconds to decide whether to swing  Despite this short window  batters still manage to hit the ball roughly    percent of the time  The mechanisms underlying these feats are at the center of new research  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In baseball, a pitch can take as little as 400 milliseconds to reach the plate. With a typical reaction time of 200 milliseconds and a swing of about 150 milliseconds, a batter must decide whether to swing and how to swing based only on the first 10 to 20 percent of the ball s flight. At that point, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the pitch s speed and trajectory. And yet, major league baseball hitters still manage to hit the ball about 25 percent of the time   40 percent if it were Ted Williams or Tony Gwynn in their primes.How batters and other athletes process this uncertain information has long fascinated scientists. The fact that humans can do this at all is an incredible feat,  said Laith Alhussein, a graduate student at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The mechanisms underlying these feats are at the center of new research from Alhussein and Maurice Smith, the Gordon McKay Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS. The research was published recently in the journal eLife. The research resolves a long-standing question about how the brain selects an action to execute when there is uncertainty about its ultimate goal, providing fundamental insight into motor planning in the nervous system. In the real world, we often interact with dynamic environments that can change rapidly in unpredictable ways, and so understanding the mechanisms by which we tame this uncertainty is critical for understanding, in general, the mechanisms the brain uses to select and plan our actions in real time,  said Smith. Previous research into motor planning during uncertainty suggested that the brain prepares for all potential goals in parallel and averages the motor plans to generate an intermediate movement that gets refined as additional information becomes available. If that were the case, a hitter s brain would average all the possible places the pitch could go within the strike zone and generate a swing based on this average, and then tweak it a bit as the pitch gets closer and the swing unfolds. But is that what the brain is actually doing? Although intermediate movements are widely observed, they could instead reflect a neural decision about the single best action choice at each point in time given the remaining uncertainty,  said Alhussein.  In our research, we systematically dissociate these possibilities using a novel experiment and find that when confronted with uncertainty, humans generate a single motor plan that optimizes task performance, rather than averaging potential motor plans.  The researchers designed several different experiments. In one, participants were given a target on a screen to aim for with a kind of robotic joystick. As the participant moved towards the target, the joystick would attempt the push them off target and the participant would have to compensate for the force. In another experiment, participants were given two targets. About a fifth of the way through each movement, one target would disappear, and the participant would need to capture the remaining target. The participant never knew which target would disappear, so they had to aim in such a way that gave them the best chance of capturing either target.  In yet another experiment, participants had to capture the target while avoiding an intervening obstacle. In all cases, we find clear evidence that, when faced with uncertainty, humans form a single motor plan that optimizes task performance at every level,  said Alhussein.  This approach choses an initial action that maximizes for the eventual success of the task.  The researchers also developed a computational model based on this performance-optimization theory that accounted for 80 to 90 percent of the variance for individual differences between participants. This work upends the decades-old theory of motor averaging and offers a mechanistic framework for understanding motor planning in the nervous system,  said Smith.  However, the mechanism by which the brain computes the single best action choice still remains to be uncovered. Reference: Alhussein L, Smith MA. Motor planning under uncertainty.

In essence, it is a molecule with a double helix structure with each unit of a helix containing what are known as  DNA bases .Maintenance of DNA is extremely important for smooth operation of all bodily functions. DNA may be damaged by cellular metabolism by-products, such as reactive oxygen species, and ionizing radiation (UV and gamma rays). In such a scenario, a set of enzymes (proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions) are activated to repair the damage. The sequence of processes undertaken by the enzymes to fix DNA damage is known as  base excision repair  (BER).BER is mainly carried out by the Exonuclease III (ExoIII) and Polymerase I (Pol I) enzymes. Despite the importance of the functions of these enzymes, the mechanism underlying their coordination has not been elucidated in previous studies.Now, scientists led by Dr. Gwangrog Lee from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) in Korea have utilized the latest technology in single-molecule detection to study enzymatic interactions and observe the mechanism of BER, filling the gap in our understanding of this coordination mechanism.In their paper published in Science Advances, the scientists reported that ExoIII has an affinity for apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites spots on the DNA double helix where a DNA base is missing in damaged DNA. It attaches itself to the AP site in damaged DNA and cleaves the double strand of DNA into a single strand by digesting a selective number of bases from the other strand. Because ExoIII is highly responsive to salt concentration, the number of bases digested and the resulting gap size depends on the physiological salt conditions. Thereafter, Pol I attaches itself to the 3  (3 prime end) of the digested DNA strand and fills the gap.Dr. Lee highlights the crux of the study, saying, Interestingly, there is perfect temporal and spatial regulation between the gap creation activity of ExoIII and the gap filling activity of Pol I, such that genomic stability is always maintained. Understanding the role of ExoIII in BER has opened several doors for future research. For instance, the expression of AP endonucleases in cancer cells is significantly higher than in normal cells, allowing AP endonucleases (e.g., ExoIII and APE1) to be used as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis. This study provides insights for investigation of operational mechanisms of other enzymes involved in DNA repair. Further research in this area could lead to technologies for targeted gene repair and drug development, concludes Dr. Lee.Reference: Yoo J, Lee D, Im H, et al.

However, very little is known about how they are degraded in the soil and how this is influenced by climate change. In two recent studies, soil ecologists at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) have shown which microbial community is responsible for degradation, what role the climate plays in this process, and why biodegradable plastics could still be problematic.Plastic that ends up in soils, oceans, or inland waters can harm the organisms living there and lead to serious and long-term disruptions in the ecosystems. The development and increased use of biodegradable plastics is therefore the focus of a more ecological economy. ""But despite the positive image of biodegradable plastics, we still know very little about how they act in the soil or how they are degraded"", says Prof. Fran ois Buscot, soil ecologist at the UFZ. In order to shed more light on this, Buscot s research team investigated the following questions in a recent study published in Environmental Science and Technology: How quickly does biodegradable plastic degrade? Which micro-organisms are involved? How do they interact? Which conditions promote the degradation process? And which inhibit it? ""We also wanted to know how the changing temperatures and precipitation levels resulting from climate change affect the degradability of the plastics"", explains Dr Witoon Purahong, also a soil ecologist at the UFZ and lead author of the study. To this end, experiments were conducted at the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF) in Bad Lauchst dt, which is currently considered as one of the world s largest outdoor climate experiment in terms of area. The researchers investigated the consequences of climate change on land use and ecosystems. The focus was on mulch and horticultural films, which are used to cover the soil. These are typically made of polyethylene (PE), a plastic produced from fossil raw materials. For technological reasons, residues of the films often remain in the soil. This leads to contamination with microplastics in the medium term. Switching to biodegradable alternatives would therefore make a lot of sense here. But are there side effects of using such alternatives? In order to find out, the team investigated how polybutylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA), a bio-based mulch film partly produced from plants (corn, sugarcane, cassava), biodegrades under the natural conditions of an agricultural field. The researchers distinguished between today s climate conditions and simulated climate conditions as projected for Germany around 2070. They used modern molecular biology methods (next generation sequencing) to determine which microbial community had colonised on the plastic itself as well as in the surrounding soil. ""We were able to show that after just under a year, around 30% of the PBSA had already degraded. This is quite a lot under the climatic conditions that currently prevail in Germany"", says Purahong. ""The main actors are fungi, which are supported by a diverse bacterial community and several other micro-organisms. These include bacteria that supply the fungi with nitrogen (which is rare in plastic) or bacteria and archaea that utilise toxic degradation products. ""An intelligent degradation and recycling community is forming on and around the plastic - even with a similar degradation rate under the simulated future climate conditions, adds Purahong. The changed climate apparently does not harm the PBSA-degrading fungi. The microbial community around them is slightly different - but the degradation result is similar. ""We hadn t expected such good news"". In another study published in Environmental Science Europe, the UFZ researchers examined the community of micro-organisms under more stringent conditions. They investigated how the community changes when large amounts of PBSA enter the soil as well as what happens when high concentration of nitrogenous fertiliser is applied. ""Large amounts of PBSA actually make the microbial community in the soil quite different"", says doctoral candidate Benjawan Tanunchai and lead author of the study. With a 6% increase of PBSA in the soil, the diversity of fungal species decreased by 45% and that of archaea by 13%. On the other hand, the high load of PBSA in combination with the fertilisation of the area led to the proliferation of Fusarium solani, a widespread plant-damaging fungus. The two UFZ studies thus yield one piece of good news and one piece of not-so-good news: PBSA in the soil can be degraded comparatively quickly and efficiently - even under future climate conditions. However, if PBSA is present in large quantities together with high concentrations of nitrogenous fertiliser, PBSA degradation can have a negative impact on agricultural production as a result of a disturbed microbial community and the increased presence of pests. ""When large amounts of plastic end up in the environment, it is never good - even if it is a biodegradable plastic"", says Buscot. ""The best thing would be to avoid plastic altogether. However, because this is currently an unrealistic goal, we should at least rely on biodegradable plastics everywhere possible and know as much as possible in advance about their degradation properties and consequences.""ReferenceTanunchai B, Juncheed K, Wahdan SFM, et al.

Different isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen make individual water molecules heavier or lighter, and weather processes like evaporation and precipitation influence the distributions of these isotopes. These isotopes have potential to reveal the weather system, but have generally been neglected in meteorological models because of the relative scarcity of isotope data compared with conventional weather measurements like temperature and wind speed. However, advances in satellite technology have made it possible to fill this gap and improve forecasting ability. For this study, the researchers used water vapor isotope data from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), a satellite-based spectrometer that observes water vapor data in the mid-troposphere between 60 S to 60 N twice a day. Measurements from an altitude of 4.5 km were used because this altitude was where the isotope measurements were most reliable. ""A local ensemble transform Kalman filter was used to assimilate the IASI data into the forecasting model"" study first author Masataka Tada explains. ""Almost 230,000 data points measured during April 2013 were used in the assimilation experiments. We used the Isotope-incorporated Global Spectral Model (IsoGSM) as the forecasting model."" Experiments were conducted to determine how incorporating these isotope data affected the modeling of other weather variables at both the global and local scales. The global experiment showed improved model skill, especially in the mid-latitudes and in the Northern Hemisphere. Most weather variables showed improved modeling, especially air temperature and specific humidity. To test the model in a local setting, the researchers investigated a low-pressure event over Japan that occurred in April, 2013. With the water vapor isotope data included, the model was better able to simulate the overall pressure pattern of this event. According to study senior and corresponding author Kei Yoshimura, ""Ours is the first study to assimilate real satellite observations of water vapor isotopes with a general circulation model and examine the effects on the modeling of both global and local dynamics. With the improvements we observed, and with the increasing availability of satellite isotope measurements, we expect further improvements to weather forecasting in the future based on isotope data.""ReferenceTada M, Yoshimura K, Toride K.

The findings were published this week in mSystems, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology. Your gut microbiome can help or cause resistance to weight loss and this opens up the possibility to try to alter the gut microbiome to impact weight loss,  said lead study author Christian Diener, Ph.D., a research scientist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington. To conduct their research, Dr. Diener and colleagues focused on a large cohort of individuals who were involved in a lifestyle intervention study. Instead of a specific diet or exercise program, this intervention involved a commercial behavioral coaching program paired with advice from a dietician and nurse coach. The researchers focused on 48 individuals who lost more than 1% of their body weight per month over a 6 to 12 month period and 57 individuals who did not lose any weight and had a stable body mass index (BMI) over the same period. The researchers relied on metagenomics, the study of genetic material recovered from blood and stool samples. The individuals analyzed blood metabolites, blood proteins, clinical labs, dietary questionnaires, and gut bacteria in the 2 groups. After controlling for age, sex and baseline BMI, the researchers identified 31 baseline stool metagenomic functional features that were associated with weight loss responses. These included complex polysaccharide and protein degradation genes, stress-response genes, respiration-related genes, cell wall synthesis genes and gut bacterial replication rates. A major finding was that the ability of the gut microbiome to breakdown starches was increased in people who did not lose weight. Another key finding was that genes that help bacteria grow faster, multiply, replicate and assemble cell walls were increased in people who lost more weight.  Before this study, we knew the composition of bacteria in the gut were different in obese people than in people who were nonobese, but now we have seen that there are a different set of genes that are encoded in the bacteria in our gut that also responds to weight loss interventions,  said Dr. Diener.  The gut microbiome is a major player in modulating whether a weight loss intervention will have success or not. The factors that dictate obesity versus nonobesity are not the same factors that dictate whether you will lose weight on a lifestyle intervention.  Research has already shown that if you change your diet, you can alter the composition of bacteria in your gut. According to Dr. Diener, if someone has a composition of gut bacterial genes that confers resistance to weight loss, then perhaps you can alter their diet to shift to a composition that would help them lose weight.

Now, however, using supercomputer analysis of big data, researchers from Japan were able to predict that a single protein is a key factor in the damage caused by two very common forms of dementia.In a study published this month in Communications Biology, researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) have revealed that the protein HMGB1 is a key player in both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer disease, two of the most common causes of dementia.Frontotemporal lobar degeneration can be caused by mutation of a variety of genes, which means that no one treatment will be right for all patients. However, there are some similarities between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer disease, which led the researchers at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) to explore whether these two conditions cause damage to the brain in the same way. Alzheimer disease pathology and frontotemporal lobar degeneration often coexist in the postmortem brain,  explains lead author of the study Meihua Jin.  Because of this overlap, we wanted to investigate whether the molecular mechanisms of disease were also similar. To do this, the researchers used a sophisticated technique called molecular network analysis to take a snapshot of which proteins are expressed, and to what degree, in mice that had been genetically engineered to mimic Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Supercomputer analysis of these protein networks was performed in mice of different ages to capture a dynamic picture of how they changed over time. The results were surprisingly clear,  says senior author Hitoshi Okazawa.  We found that the core protein protein interaction networks in Alzheimer disease and in frontotemporal lobar degeneration were highly similar, sharing almost 50% of core nodes. Further analysis of these core protein nodes predicted that signaling through HMGB1, which is a critical factor in Alzheimer disease, also plays a key role in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Importantly, this result was confirmed by the researchers, who found that treating mice with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with an antibody to HMGB1 improved their long-term memory, short-term memory, and spatial memory. Our new method successfully predicted and identified HMGB1 as a key target for treating patients who have dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, regardless of the genetic basis of the disease,  says Jin.Given the fact that the mice recovered their memory after several months of treatment with the anti-HMGB1 antibody, it is possible that treatments targeting this protein could actually reverse damage in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Because similar molecular changes are seen in many different types of dementia, a treatment based on this antibody could be effective in a wide range of patients.Reference: Jin M, Jin X, Homma H, et al.

Still, the rigor of the clinical study and some of its novel investigative approaches are seen as improving the prospects for future clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of disease-modifying therapies for people with Parkinson s disease. The results were published in Journal of the American Medical Association. The convergence of epidemiological, biological, and clinical data from past research made a compelling argument that elevating urate, the main antioxidant circulating in the blood, could protect against the oxidative damage thought to play a role in Parkinson s disease,  says senior author Michael Schwarzschild, MD, PhD, a neurologist at MGH and co-leader of the MGH-based Parkinson Study Group, a network of North American researchers dedicated to improving therapy for people with PD.  While our study did not rule out a protective effect of urate in Parkinson s, it clearly showed that increasing urate did not slow disease progression based on clinical assessments and serial bran scan biomarkers of neurodegeneration. No treatment to date has been shown to prevent or forestall progression of Parkinson s disease, which affects the body s motor system. For its Phase III trial, known as SURE-PD3, the MGH-led team enrolled 298 individuals recently diagnosed with early Parkinson s disease based on scans that indicated substantial loss of the dopamine-producing brain cells characteristic of PD. The results showed that of participants who received over the course of two years the metabolite inosine -- which raises levels of urate in the brain and blood and has shown neuroprotective properties in preclinical models -- there was no significant difference in the rate of disease progression compared to those in the placebo group. The study did reveal, however, an increased rate of kidney stones among those randomized to inosine treatment.Despite the lack of evidence to support urate elevation, Schwarzschild found the study successful in other ways.  The findings were very helpful in providing a reality check that now allows the field to move on to other therapeutic approaches,  he explains.  We also learned a lot in terms of clinical trials science for Parkinson s, and ways to conduct future studies that will increase their chance of success.  One of those ways is to tailor treatment to subsets of patients who are most likely to benefit   a hallmark of the move to precision medicine in Parkinson s research. In SURE-PD3, for example, only patients who had lower levels of urate were enrolled to increase the chance of benefit and reduce the chance of side effects.Another innovative feature of the trial is that many participants gave blood samples for genotyping   a valuable source of genetic information that could figure in the hunt for clinical solutions in smaller subpopulations of PD patients. A significant number also volunteered for an extension of the study to help determine how monitoring at home could provide more efficient ways to conduct future clinical trials.  There were many positive results from SURE-PD3 which we believe will improve the prospects of researchers discovering a disease-modifying therapy which people with Parkinson s have been desperately seeking,  concludes Schwarzschild.Reference: The Parkinson Study Group SURE-PD3 Investigators.

One responsible mechanism involves the impaired function of the bone-marrow stem cells, which are required for the maintenance of bone integrity. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing and CECAD Cluster of Excellence for Ageing Research at the University of Cologne have now shown that the reduced stem cell function upon ageing is due to changes in their epigenome. They were able to reverse these changes in isolated stem cells by adding acetate. This fountain of youth for the epigenome could become important for the treatment of diseases such as osteoporosis.Ageing Researchers have been looking at epigenetics as a cause of ageing processes for some time. Epigenetics looks at changes in genetic information and chromosomes that do not alter the sequence of the genes themselves, but do affect their activity. One possibility is changes in proteins called histones, which package the DNA in our cells and thus control access to DNA. The Cologne research group of Peter Tessarz has now studied the epigenome of mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells are found in bone marrow and can give rise to different types of cells such as cartilage, bone and fat cells.""We wanted to know why these stem cells produce less material for the development and maintenance of bones as we age, causing more and more fat to accumulate in the bone marrow. To do this, we compared the epigenome of stem cells from young and old mice,"" explains Andromachi Pouikli, first author of the study. ""We could see that the epigenome changes significantly with age. Genes that are important for bone production are particularly affected.""Rejuvenation of the epigenomeThe researchers then investigated whether the epigenome of stem cells could be rejuvenated. To do this, they treated isolated stem cells from mouse bone marrow with a nutrient solution which contained sodium acetate. The cell converts the acetate into a building block that enzymes can attach to histones to increase access to genes, thereby boosting their activity. ""This treatment impressively caused the epigenome to rejuvenate, improving stem cell activity and leading to higher production of bone cells,"" Pouikli said.To clarify whether this change in the epigenome could also be the cause of the increased risk in old age for bone fractures or osteoporosis in humans, the researchers studied human mesenchymal stem cells from patients after hip surgery. The cells from elderly patients who also suffered from osteoporosis showed the same epigenetic changes as previously observed in the mice.A new therapeutic approach against osteoporosis?""Sodium acetate is also available as a food additive, however, it is not advisable to use it in this form against osteoporosis, as our observed effect is very specific to certain cells. However, there are already first experiences with stem cell therapies for osteoporosis. Such a treatment with acetate could also work in such a case. However, we still need to investigate in more detail the effects on the whole organism in order to exclude possible risks and side effects,"" explains Peter Tessarz, who led the study.Reference: Pouikli A, Parekh S, Maleszewska M, et al.

Certain gene mutations or those with a known history of other cancers and radiation therapy may predispose patients to develop brain cancer. Tumour relapse is invariably inevitable due to the resistance of glioblastoma towards standard therapies. Additionally, the infiltrative nature of these tumour cells means it is often not possible to surgically remove them completely.Researchers from NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine have discovered that the FDA-approved anti-fungal drug, sulconazole, exhibits anti-cancer properties towards glioblastoma cells. This was published in the latest issue of Science Advances. An in-depth investigation of this compound revealed that it competes with biotin (Vitamin H), an important co-factor for metabolic enzymes and modifier of histones, allowing it to inhibit the normal function of biotin-dependent metabolic enzymes and specific histone modification-associated gene expression. This compromises glioblastoma metabolism and epigenetics, thereby impairing the tumour growth and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells.In mammalian cells, holocarboxylase synthetase, or HLCS, is the enzyme that serves to distribute biotin to the biotin-dependent proteins. Gene silencing of HLCS mitigates the glioblastoma s tumorigenicity   its tendency to develop tumours   in mouse models.  High HLCS expression is also associated with glioblastoma and inferior glioma patient outcome. While HLCS is present in healthy patients, its expression increases in the tumours of glioblastoma patients. Glioblastoma cells with higher HLCS expression will be able to better supply biotin to the biotin-dependent metabolic enzymes and histones, which results in a more proliferative and invasive glioblastoma. Thus, the dependency of glioblastoma on biotin distribution suggests that the rational co-targeting of biotin-dependent metabolism and epigenetic pathways may be explored for glioblastoma eradication. Since biotin is found in various food sources, including legumes, egg yolk and offal, and commonly consumed as a supplement, these findings raise an important consideration of regulating biotin consumption in glioblastoma patients. This discovery would also lay the foundation for the development of drug combinations from existing or new small molecule inhibitors against some of the biotin-dependent metabolic enzymes and histone modifications to cripple glioblastoma; some of these are already being actively explored in cancer treatment,  said Assistant Professor Derrick Ong from the Department of Physiology and Principal Investigator of this study.Reference: Yoon J, Grinchuk OV, Kannan S, et al.

The researchers are currently testing whether this function is also effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.It s one thing for a protein to act directly against a specific virus, as SERINC5 has been shown to do by incorporating itself into the HIV particle during viral production. But it s another thing entirely to reveal that a protein has an enhancing effect on an essential antiviral cell signaling pathway upon infection of host cells, said senior study author Shan-Lu Liu, professor of virology in the Department of Veterinary Biosciences at The Ohio State University. Viruses can get around direct antiviral effects,  said Liu, also an investigator and associate director in Ohio State s Center for Retrovirus Research.  But if this protein can also modulate key pathways without acting directly on the virus, then a virus may have limited capacity to counteract it. If this family of molecules can do this in animals and humans, then you may think about whether it could be used in a broad antiviral therapy. The research is published today (Sept. 14, 2021) in the journal Science Signaling.Liu has studied what he calls the  evolutionary arms race  between HIV and the human immune system for years, and led a 2019 study that described how an HIV protein called Nef can get the upper hand in that fight   specifically by interfering with SERINC proteins in virus-producing cells.In this study, Liu and colleagues took a closer look at SERINC5 s functions in target cells during the next viral infection stage. They found that in addition to boosting the signals that produce type I interferons, SERINC5 has the same effect on signals that generate another component of the early antiviral response   NF-kB inflammatory cytokines.SERINC5 doesn t modulate this signaling system on its own   it joins forces with other proteins called MAVS and TRAF6. But some of its exact behaviors are still a mystery, Liu said.In cell cultures in which viral infection had been initiated, the researchers observed that SERINC5 relocates itself from the cell surface to just outside the membrane around the mitochondria, a cell s power center   an unusual move. Once there, SERINC5 teamed up with MAVS and TRAF6 to form a big, multifaceted complex   a likely explanation for why its role is so influential on what happens next in the signaling pathway. The aggregation of these proteins means they need each other   and this is an exciting finding,  said Liu, also co-director of the Viruses and Emerging Pathogens program in Ohio State s Infectious Diseases Institute.  A big complex like this can recruit additional molecules, enhancing the efficiency of the signal transduction pathway. These recruited molecules are part of a cascade of messages that lead to type I interferon production and NF-kB inflammatory cytokines from virus-infected cells, both of which play a crucial role in limiting viral infection in the early stage. In experiments utilizing multiple types of human and animal cell cultures, this mechanism was seen to inhibit infection of cells by HIV, Ebola and Zika viruses.In contrast, when cells were modified so they didn t produce the SERINC5 protein, these viruses took over cells and replicated more   suggesting how important SERINC s role is in the process that potentiates the primary antiviral response of host cells.This work was conducted in two members of the SERINC family, SERINC3 and SERINC5, but Liu speculated that other versions may have similar effects. But there is still a lot to learn   such as what triggers SERINC5 to relocate itself from the cell surface to mitochondria, and what its normal cellular functions are when there is no virus around.As for whether the protein s functions can suppress the COVID-19 virus, Liu is optimistic. My speculation is the SERINC protein would have an effect because we know type I interferons are so important to controlling a virus in the early stage, and this molecule can enhance the type I interferon response,  he said.  Finding one protein that can modulate a key pathway that has a broad antiviral effect   well, you can imagine this protein has a broad antiviral function.

Moreover, they were able to apply their findings to generate functional egg cells and even grow viable mice.The team hopes these findings can be used to treat infertility by understanding its underlying causes and to aid the conservation of critically endangered animals through the production of egg cells.A core tenet in studying stem cells is understanding how a single cell with the potential to become anything can specialize into cells that make up an organ or tissue, a process called 'differentiation.' Katsuhiko Hayashi, professor at Kyushu University s Faculty of Medical Sciences, has been working on uncovering the mechanisms behind the growth and development of the fundamental cell for life: the oocyte. The oocyte is the immature stage of the ovum, also known as an egg cell,  says Hayashi, who led the study published in Science.  Many major breakthroughs have been made in understanding oocyte development, going as far as generating mouse and human oocytes from their respective stem cells and even breeding healthy mice. However, one major hurdle in the process is making the proper support system that helps differentiate stem cells into oocytes. In the body, primary oocytes begin to mature during puberty with the support of other cells. This collective aggregate that eventually produces a mature egg cell is called the ovarian follicle.""While we have been able to artificially make mouse oocytes from stem cells, for them to mature we had to combine them with cells called gonadal somatic cells that were extracted from mice,"" explains first author Takashi Yoshino, assistant professor at the Faculty of Medical Sciences.""If we hope to better understand oocyte development and apply this technology to endangered animals and even humans, we must also be able to make the support system from stem cells.""The team's first step was to study mice and identify the critical genes and their production timing that gives rise to gonadal somatic cells. Following the identification, they meticulously tested mouse stem cells under differing culture conditions until they were able to produce cells with similar features.""We call these cells fetal ovarian somatic cell like cells, or FOSLCs, since they have the same genetic expression profiles as gonadal somatic cells. The next step was to aggregate the FOSLCs with the stem-cell-derived primordial germ cells the oocyte precursors we've been developing through our past work and see if they mature into oocytes,"" says Yoshino.After several days of growth, they were able to observe the cells beginning to form follicle structures surrounding the oocytes. Following confirmation that these cells were in fact fully grown oocytes, the eggs were fertilized and transferred into a surrogate mouse, successfully giving rise to offspring.The new system is expected to provide a means of producing a large number of oocytes without the need for harvesting the necessary cells from host animals.""This will significantly help improve our understanding of ovarian follicle development and reproductive biology as a whole,"" explains Hayashi.""The application on humans is technically feasible, but because of the genetic and epigenetic instability of in vitro made gametes, we still must carefully think and discuss the ethics and technology of its application. We will continue our work to further elucidate the mechanisms of this fundamental and unique extension of life.""Reference: Yoshino T, Suzuki T, Nagamatsu G, et al.

But in a certain way it applies here, too: testicles consist of many different types of cells, and up to now this complex quality prevented these types from being isolated and then analysed. And this posed problems for physicians and researchers especially in the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility. Dr. Nina Neuhaus and Dr. Sandra Laurentino from Clinical Research Group 326    Male Germ Cells    at the University of M nster want to change this. The project the two researchers are engaged on reveals for the first time   on the basis of the RNA sequencing of individual cells   the molecular and cellular changes in the testicular tissue of infertile men. The authors have now published the data in the prestigious journal Cell Reports Medicine.In the ejaculate of a healthy man there are millions of sperm; their formation depends on an efficient stem-cell system. However, in the case of men with cryptozoospermia   a reduced sperm count   there are fewer than 0.1 million sperm present. The natural fertilization of an egg cell is almost impossible with such a reduced count. The resulting diagnosis of  male infertility  is not only distressing for those involved   it also poses a challenge for the physicians treating them. A clear cause is to be found in only just under one-third of such diagnoses. What changes were exhibited by these patients  testicular tissue   in which the sperm is formed by a differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (spermatogonia)   was, up to now, very largely unknown. This was, above all, due to the lack of any technical possibilities of isolating and analysing the individual cell types.For their studies, the M nster research team carried out an analysis of the gene expression of individual cells. So-called RNA sequencing allows the succession of nucleotides in the RNA (ribonucleic acid) to be defined, and in this way cell-specific features and changes in the expression of the genes examined can be detected. By analysing around 30,000 individual cells, the team obtained a clear picture of the spermatogonia. The special feature of the research is a bioinformatic analysis of the individual cells, in which thousands of cells from healthy testicular tissue were compared with those from patients with cryptozoospermia. What surprised us,  says Neuhaus,  was the fact that in patients with cryptozoospermia, in comparison with healthy patients, the number of spermatogonia is unchanged. However, a change can be found in the reserve stem cells of the spermatogonia.  Under normal conditions, she says, the testicle sends around one-half of its spermatogonia into a  deep sleep , so as to reactivate them if needed   in order to be able to restore sperm production and counteract any stem cell loss. In the case of any cryptozoospermia, the number of reserve stem cells is greatly reduced. The cause of this, as assumed by the team, is explained by Dr. Laurentino thus:  The constant recruitment of reserve stem cells probably cannot be maintained indefinitely and may lead to a progressive qualitative and quantitative deterioration of sperm formation. By making it possible to gain a high-res picture of the testicles of infertile patients, the interdisciplinary study produced by the  Male Germ Cells  research team has revealed the dynamics behind the regulation of the spermatogonial stem cell system. As a result, the study has prepared the ground for a better diagnosis of previously unclarified cases of male infertility.Reference: Di Persio S, Tekath T, Siebert-Kuss LM, et al.

The two phase-3 clinical trials of aducanumab on which the drug s approval was based showed increased risk of certain adverse vascular events. Though the clinical trials excluded participants based on advanced age, certain chronic diseases and use of anti-clotting medications, FDA approval was granted without contraindications or precautions for use of the drug in these patient populations. In a research letter in JAMA, physician-researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) examined medical claims for Medicare enrollees with a diagnosis of either cognitive impairment, Alzheimer s disease, or Alzheimer s disease related disorders. The team found that the vast majority of these patients had one or more conditions that would have excluded them from the aducanumab clinical trials, including cardiovascular disease, prior stroke, use of blood thinners, and age over 85 years.   Our findings are concerning given the broad FDA labelling for aducanumab,  said corresponding author Timothy S. Anderson, MD, MAS, a clinician investigator and assistant professor medicine in the Division of General Medicine at BIDMC.  The public conversation on aducanumab has focused on limited benefit and high costs, it is equally important to consider that the majority of patients with Alzheimer s disease are likely to face higher risks of adverse events than the patients studied in the trials.  Analyzing data from more than 27 million Medicare beneficiaries, Anderson and colleagues found that more than 92 percent of patients with Alzheimer s disease related dementia, 91 percent of patients with Alzheimer s disease and 85 percent of patients with cognitive impairment met at least one of the aducanumab trial exclusion criterion. More than 77 percent of patients with Alzheimer s disease related dementia met multiple exclusion criteria, as did majorities of patients with the other diagnoses.   Clinical trials of aducanumab studied relatively healthy participants who do not reflect the majority of older adults with dementia in the US,  Anderson said. As a result, Medicare should consider restricting coverage for aducanumab to patients who meet the trial eligibility criteria, and additional clinical trials of the high-risk groups excluded from the prior trials should be required, including rigorous study of adverse events, prior to broadening coverage.

The approach involves using a molecule that can provide energy to anti-cancer immune cells, increasing their numbers and improving their longevity. The findings were published by Kyoto University scientists, led by Hiroshi Sugiyama, in the journal Cell Chemical Biology.Cancer cells express molecules that can target a receptor to inactivate tumor-fighting T cells.  Therapeutics that block the immunosuppressive molecule, called PD-L1, from binding to the T cell surface receptor, called PD-1, have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, more than half of cancer patients don t respond well to this immunotherapy,  explains Madhu Malinee, the study s first author. One of the major reasons for this unresponsiveness is that these patients have an insufficient number of T cells that also become exhausted because they don t have enough active energy-providing mitochondria,  adds Ganesh Namasivayam Pandian of Kyoto University s Institute of Integrated Cell Material Sciences (iCeMS).The team wanted to find a way to increase the mitochondria in T cells to improve cancer patient response to PD-1 blockade monotherapy. Their aim was to activate a molecule, called PGC-1, which regulates the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. A major roadblock to achieving this, however, has been finding a way to selectively target PGC-1.To do this, Sugiyama and colleagues used a compound, called pyrrole-imidazole polyamide (PIP), that can be programmed to target a specific DNA sequence. They assembled it as a molecular code, called EnPGC-1, that can activate PGC-1.The team found that EnPGC-1 activated the mitochondria of mouse T cells in the laboratory, which led to an increase in T cell numbers and their longevity.They then gave tumor-bearing mice a combination of EnPGC-1 with PD-1 blockade immunotherapy and found the strategy enhanced anti-tumor immunity in the mice and improved their survival. Since PGC-1 signaling is known to be essential for energy metabolism, EnPGC-1 also has potential for being developed as a drug to treat other diseases, like type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia,  says Madhu. Further improvements are needed before the approach can be tested for clinical use , adds Ganesh. For example, the team aims to find ways to deliver EnPGC-1 specifically to T cells to reduce its off-target effects.Reference: Malinee M, Pandian GN, Sugiyama H.

These fossils were sitting around for 54 million years, and a lot can happen in that time,  says Keegan Selig, lead author of the study who recently completed his PhD in Professor Mary Silcox s lab in the department of anthropology at U of T Scarborough.  I think most people assumed these holes were some kind of damage that happened over time, but they always occurred in the same part of the tooth and consistently had this smooth, rounded curve to them.  Very few fossils of M. latidens s body have been found, but a large sample of fossilized teeth have been unearthed over the years in Wyoming s southern Bighorn Basin. While they were first dug up in the 1970s and have been studied extensively since, Selig is the first to identify little holes in the fossilized teeth as being cavities. Cavities form when bacteria in the mouth turns foods containing carbohydrates into acids. These acids erode tooth enamel (the hard protective coating on the tooth) before eating away at dentin, the softer part of the tooth beneath the enamel. This decay slowly develops into tiny holes. For the research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, Selig looked at the fossilized teeth of a thousand individuals under a microscope and was able to identify cavities in 77 of them. To verify the results, he also did micro-CT scans (a type of X-ray that looks inside an object without having to break it apart) on some of the fossils. As for what caused the cavities, Selig says the likely culprit was the animal s fruit-rich diet. While primates would have been eating fruit for quite some time before M. Latidens, fruit became more abundant around 65 million years ago for a variety of reasons   therefore primates would have started eating more of it. Seven per cent of the fossil teeth studied amongst an older group of M. latidens contained cavities, while 17 per cent of a more recent group contained cavities. This suggests a shift in M. Latidens's diet over time that included more fruit or other sugar-rich foods.  Eating fruit is considered one of the hallmarks of what makes early primates unique,  says Selig, whose research looks on reconstructing the diets of fossil mammals. He adds that M. Latidens would naturally want to eat fruit since its full of sugar and contains a lot of energy.  If you re a little primate scurrying around in the trees, you would want to eat food with a high energy value. They also likely weren t concerned about getting cavities.  The study, which received funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), offers a framework to help researchers look for cavities in the fossils of other extinct mammals. Selig says identifying cavities in fossils can tell us a lot about the biology of these animals. It can help figure out what they were eating and how they evolved over time based on their diet. For example, while evolutionary changes in the structure of a jaw or teeth suggest broader changes in diet over time, cavities also offer a window into what that specific animal was eating in their lifetime.  It might be surprising to some that cavities are not a modern phenomenon   and they certainly are not only unique to humans,  he says.   I think it s interesting that here we have evidence of cavities that are more than 54 million years old, and that its teeth can tell us so much about this ancient animal that we couldn t get anywhere else.

We believe this can become a therapy for muscular dystrophy, including the many different forms of muscular dystrophy,  said senior study author Elizabeth McNally, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Genetic Medicine and the Elizabeth J. Ward Professor of Genetic Medicine.  Given the success with so many other antibodies in treating chronic human diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, we are very optimistic this antibody can translate into the human disease setting. The antibody targets the TGF-beta pathway, a pathway known to be important for regulating scarring (fibrosis). In muscular dystrophy, the muscles become scarred over time, and this antibody helps reduce scarring in the muscles. With this treatment the muscles also became stronger.The study was conducted in an animal model of muscular dystrophy, and the scientists hope to develop the antibody to treat people, since the pathways are the same in the animal models as they are in people with muscular dystrophy.About 300,000 people in the U.S. live with muscular dystrophy. There are currently only a small number of treatments for a tiny percentage of patients who have very specific gene mutations. Most patients with muscular dystrophy have no therapeutic options.The target protein in this case binds the three major forms of TGF-beta, which makes it more effective than other approaches that target single forms of TGF-beta. Many scientists have tried to target TGF-beta to treat disease, but it has been difficult to do this successfully because of the multiple forms and their complicated pathway of action.The team made an antibody to the protein that binds all three forms of TGF-beta and stabilizes these proteins so they cannot become active. Too much TGF-beta activity is a major contributor to scarring and muscle weakness in muscular dystrophy.Alexis Demonbreun, PhD, the lead study author and an assistant professor of Pharmacology, selected antibodies to the hinge region of the target protein (called LTBP4), since this hinge is critically important to stabilizing and keeping TGF-beta from being overactive. The hinge is normally cleaved by enzymes to trigger release of TGF-beta. The antibody blocks the cleavage and the activation of the complex.The next steps in the research are optimizing the antibody sequence to improve its activity and so that it can be produced in larger quantities. Once that is done, the full safety studies are required before launching a clinical trial.Reference: Demonbreun Alexis R., Fallon Katherine S., Oosterbaan Claire C., et al.

Samples of DNA and nucleic acids from a racially diverse group of 588 children, ages 1 month to 15 years old, found that environmental factors such as SES could influence the health of individuals throughout their lives, potentially influencing such measures as blood pressure, height, weight, diabetes, obesity and even attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Gut microbiota play an important role in a broad range of body functions, including the immune system, metabolic and inflammatory processes, and the central nervous system. While previous studies have examined how SES can affect the gut microbiome of adults, this is one of the first such examinations in young children, according to the study published recently in the journal Microorganisms.  These findings may have important implications for understanding how interventions in childhood could help prevent the eventual impact of SES on microbiome diversity and subsequent health,  said Candace Lewis, Ph.D., a post-doctoral fellow in TGen s Neurogenomics Division, and the study s lead author.  Our results demonstrate that modifiable environmental factors, such as SES, may influence gut microbiome composition at an early age.  Human DNA samples were collected from saliva. Microbial nucleic acid samples were extracted from stool. Investigators tested and ranked for an abundance of gut microbes, including: Anaerostipes, Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae. Parents with more years of education had children who scored higher on a  latent microbiome factor,  defined as higher abundance of Anaerostipes, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae, and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Faecalibacterium, considered a key biomarker of a healthy gut, produces butyrate, which is an energy source that plays a major role in gut physiology and has several beneficial health effects, including protection against pathogens, modulation of the immune system, and reduction of cancer progression.  Faecalibacterium abundance may be one biological pathway in which early environmental influences shape disease vulnerability through life,  the study said. Other factors considered in the study were age, sex, antibiotic exposure, and even birth type (whether the child was born vaginally or by caesarean section).  These results are important, as our understanding of gut microbiome influences on health continue to expand,  said Sarah Highlander, Ph.D., a Research Professor in TGen s Pathogen and Microbiome Division and one of the study s authors.  This study tests the associations between family SES with the relative abundance of microbiota type and diversity of infants and children, while controlling for potential genetic associations.

Without this layer, the nerve impulses that travel through the body are slowed, causing neurological problems.Though there are therapies that manage symptoms or attempt to slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, effective treatments would require restoring lost myelin. Finding methods to kick the myelination process into high gear is a crucial step in the quest for treatment.Anastassia Voronova, assistant professor in the Department of Medical Genetics and Canada Research Chair in Neural Stem Cell Biology, explains that neural stem cells produce a variety of brain cells, including oligodendrocytes, a type of cell in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Oligodendrocytes are the only brain cells that produce myelin. During development, these neural stem cells build the brain. In the adult brain, part of the reason they exist is to replenish damaged or lost cells, including oligodendrocytes,  said Voronova, who is also a member of the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute.  However, especially in humans, replacement of oligodendrocytes is very inefficient. The goal of my lab is to identify molecules that are capable of  waking up  those neural stem cells we all have in our brain to replenish those oligodendrocytes. Voronova s study showed that fractalkine   a molecule previously thought to have a role only in the immune system   noticeably stimulated the transformation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes. The [fractalkine] molecule and receptor work together to elicit a signalling cascade inside of the cell,  said Voronova. This is a really interesting era to be doing this science in,  noted Voronova.  I think we re just starting to appreciate the full spectrum of what these oligodendrocytes can do. Voronova s team is now investigating the remyelination capacity of fractalkine in a mouse model of MS. Voronova also plans to examine whether fractalkine could affect myelination in other neurodegenerative disorders. She added that the immunological nature of fractalkine could also be important for future drug development, as MS and neurodegenerative disorders have a strong immune component. Myelin is diminished in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, which makes the idea of enhancing oligodendrocyte production, and therefore repair of the myelin, so exciting.

These are one of the largest species of prawn (females can reach 27cm in length!) and are found throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In Japan, they re considered a delicacy and have been a major fisheries and aquaculture product (especially in Okinawa) since the early 20th century. But a big problem with the shrimp farms is that the high density of the animal means that diseases spread quickly.One concerning disease is a viral infection called white spot disease, which is one of the most threatening pathogens to shrimp aquaculture worldwide. It is lethal and highly contagious; outbreaks have wiped out entire farms in just a few days. We re interested in the relationship between aquaculture animals and disease-related bacteria and viruses,  explained Dr. Eiichi Shoguchi, a Group Leader in the Marine Genomics Unit at OIST.  Having this genetic resource on hand could be useful for producing a disease-resistant line of the shrimp or vaccines. Supported by OIST s DNA Sequencing Section, the researchers used two different techniques genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing to produce this genetic resource. Their work was published in G3: Genes l Genomes l Genetics.   A genome is the full set of genetic information found in every cell. It is subdivided into genes. These genes are made up of DNA base pairs and each gene contains the instructions needed to create a protein, and thus leads to the proper care and maintenance of a cell. For the instructions to be carried out, the DNA must first be transcribed into RNA. A transcriptome is a collection of all these gene readouts. In some ways, the transcriptome can be considered a reflection of the genome. Some genes might be related to disease resistance, and some individuals may contain variations of these gene that leads to stronger resistance. If these genes can be identified, then it could be possible to establish a disease-resistant line of shrimp.Firstly, the researchers focused on deciphering the genome. They took one kuruma shrimp from a commercial farm in Okinawa and generated the initial sequences. This produced many short DNA sequences which, although useful, didn t provide the researchers with enough clues to string them together. Essentially, they had all the pieces of a puzzle but no way of assembling it. They then used a second technology to produce longer, but less precise, DNA sequences the scaffolding of the genome. By bringing the two sequences together they were able to assemble a draft of the genome.Following this, the researchers analyzed 49 RNA samples of different shrimp individuals (including both adults and larvae). This provided them with 66,406 high-quality gene readouts the draft of the transcriptome.""The kuruma shrimp genome provides us with a comprehensive catalog of immune-related genes,  explained Mr. Satoshi Kawato, lead author of the paper and PhD student at the Laboratory of Genome Science, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology.  This will allow us to better understand how shrimp respond to pathogens and will aid in developing strategies for preventing disease outbreaks. The genomic resources will also help address various other aspects of shrimp biology, such as growth and reproduction.""When their work was compared to that of the kuruma shrimp s relatives the giant tiger prawn and the whiteleg shrimp nearly 70% genes was found to be the same across all three species, meaning that a high number of genes have been preserved. We think that this will serve as a useful resource for future research to understand the shrimp s basic biology,  concluded Dr. Shoguchi.  But it could also be used for fishery management and to establish a breeding program. Reference: Kawato S, Nishitsuji K, Arimoto A, et al.

But the study suggests that early screening may be beneficial for second- and third-degree relatives as well.The study found that first-degree relatives of someone diagnosed with early-onset colorectal cancer are 6 times more likely to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer before age 50, while second-degree relatives are 3 times likelier and third-degree relatives 1.56 times likelier.First-degree relatives include parents, children and siblings. Second-degree relatives include aunts, uncles, grandparents, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. First cousins, great-grandparents and great-grandchildren are examples of third-degree relatives.The findings were published last month in the journal Cancer Epidemiology. Researchers from the University at Buffalo and University of Utah led the study, which reviewed more than 1,500 early-onset colon cancer cases in the Utah Cancer Registry, part of the Utah Population Data Base. Unique Utah resources, including a decades old National Cancer Institute statewide cancer registry and computerized genealogy data for the majority of the population, made this important collaboration possible,  says Lisa Cannon-Albright, PhD, professor and leader of the genetic epidemiology program in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Utah School of Medicine. She is also a Huntsman Cancer Institute investigator. Our study provides new insight into the magnitude of risk for more distant relatives of colorectal cancer cases, and in particular, for relatives of cases who were diagnosed before age 50,  says first author Heather Ochs-Balcom, PhD, associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health in UB s School of Public Health and Health Professions. This work is important given the rising rates of early-onset colorectal cancer. The study also found that individuals are at a 2.6-fold higher risk of colorectal cancer at any age if they have a first-degree relative with early-onset colon cancer. The risk is 1.96 and 1.3 times greater for second- and third-degree relatives, respectively.  In addition, the risk for all degrees of relatives for early-onset colon cancer is higher than the risk for colon cancer at any age.The findings suggest that early colonoscopy screening may be beneficial for second-degree relatives and possibly third-degree relatives, in addition to first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer before age 50.The researchers also point out that relatives may benefit from being more aware of their extended family history and sharing this information with their physician when making cancer screening decisions.Reference: Ochs-Balcom HM, Kanth P, Cannon-Albright LA.

Schenk Esq. Professor in Ophthalmology for Research of the Aging Eye, and vice chair for research at UIC. The research paper,  OPTN is a host intrinsic restriction factor against neuroinvasive HSV-1 infection,  led by Shukla, was published recently in the journal Nature Communications. Researchers sought to discover why HSV-1 can become fatal for individuals who are immunocompromised but not for healthy individuals. Herpesviruses naturally infect the central nervous system and can result in degenerative brain and eye disorders, as well as encephalitis. However, in most individuals, the virus is suppressed during a primary infection before it can significantly damage the central nervous system. The new research suggests why HSV-1 is suppressed: OPTN, a conserved autophagy receptor, selectively targets HSV-1 proteins to degradation by autophagy, explained Tejabhiram Yadavalli, a co-author of the study and visiting scholar at UIC s department of ophthalmology and visual science.  OPTN stops the virus from growing and it stops it by autophagy   engulfing the virus particles inside tiny vesicles called autophagosomes. The autophagy that happens is very selective. That has meaning for other viruses as well,  Shukla said. The researchers believe the results from this study will apply to all eight different human herpesviruses. For the study, mice with removed OPTN genes were infected with ocular HSV-1. The virus growth was much higher in the brains of animals without OPTN, killing local neurons and eventually leading to animal death. This shows there is a faster degeneration of neurons when OPTN is not there. Additional studies are being planned to examine naturally occurring mutations in OPTN, such as the ones reported in glaucoma and ALS patients, and how they may affect neuronal health and HSV-1 infection, Shukla explained.  Where you have mutated OPTN plus herpes, you have the recipe to create a disaster in terms of neurodegeneration,  Shukla said.  The study also shows there is an impairment of immune response when there is a deficiency in OPTN.  OPTN is needed to signal an influx of proper immune cells at the site of infection. When you don t have it, you have issues,  said Chandrashekhar Patil, also a co-author of the study and a visiting scholar at UIC s department of ophthalmology and visual science. Some of those issues could include neurodegenerative disorders, which researchers believe further research may show.  We think we will have data to show other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, Kaposi s sarcoma, varicella-zoster, are all going to share this mechanism because they share homologous proteins,  Shukla said. Because the herpesvirus sits in neurons forever, there is speculation it is connected to neurodegenerative diseases. The immune system requires inflammation to constantly fight off the virus, and neurons have some degree of damage because of this continuous immune response, according to Dr. Tibor Valyi-Nagy, professor of pathology, director of neuropathology at UIC and research collaborator on the study. The study also showed that animals without OPTN and infected with HSV-1 after 30 days lost the ability to recognize objects. Shukla said this could be an indication that having HSV-1 along with a mutation of OPTN could accelerate neuronal damage, which would translate into cognitive impairment.  Part of our translational research can be how can we correct the problems with OPTN so that we don t have issues with neurodegeneration,  Shukla said.ReferenceAmes J, Yadavalli T, Suryawanshi R, et al.

This would help her pinpoint where her monarch samples had hatched and, perhaps, better understand the migratory routes of this endangered insect. Megan s trip took 74 days, traveling 20,000 kilometres over 22 states to collect samples with the help of teachers, state and federal biologists, city employees, campground owners, and farmers. She has now published a research paper demonstrating how mapping strontium isotopes can greatly improve the ability to track these important insects.  As animals feed on the landscape, they gather and preserve the local isotopic signature in inert tissues, and with monarchs it s in their wings. These tissues preserve the isotopic signature of the individual's natal origin,  says Megan, a PhD student in the Faculty of Science.  In this study, we show that strontium isotopes, particularly when combined with hydrogen isotopes, can help researchers pinpoint where a monarch butterfly hatched to a more precise area. We then used the new tool by applying it to a sample of monarchs to see where they originated.  Tracking monarch butterflies, which are small-bodied and traverse thousands of miles over international borders, is an expensive and difficult task. Recovering tagged monarchs is rare. Understanding the migration routes of an insect that transports biomass, nutrients, pollen, genetic information, and ecosystem services across a continent is critical, especially to understand why this butterfly s population numbers have been declining.  Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons and electrons but have a different number of neutrons, which makes them have different masses. The ratios between heavy and light isotopes vary spatially on the landscape,  explains Megan.  Up until now, mainly hydrogen isotopes have been used for tracing the natal origin of monarch butterflies and have provided critical information relevant to monarch conservation. Unlike a radio collar which could tell you exactly where an animal travelled, hydrogen isotopes can only tell you the general area where the tissue was formed. In this study, we show that strontium isotopes, particularly when combined with hydrogen isotopes, can help researchers pinpoint where a monarch butterfly hatched to a more precise area   about four times better.  Ultimately, Megan analyzed 100 monarch butterflies and found the overwintering monarchs likely originated in Texas, demonstrating the ability of isotopes to answer essential questions about animal migration, providing a geographic snapshot and potential clues to understanding population decline.  In the case of monarchs, multiple reasons for the population decline have been suggested, including deforestation and extreme weather events, loss of habitat on the summer breeding grounds, mortality during the southward migration, increased parasitism, and the effects of climate change,  says Megan, who collaborated with colleagues at the University of Guelph and the University of Maryland s Center for Environmental Science in this research.  To understand the relative contribution and strength of these drivers, we need a better understanding of monarch migratory connectivity and patterns over time. We have now been able to establish a new, ready-to-use tool for researchers that will aid in the conservation of the monarch butterfly. ReferenceReich MS et al.

It is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with over 42,000 people diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK. It is also the second biggest cancer killer, with 16,000 people with bowel cancer dying in the UK every year.The University of Birmingham-led research involved the study of 184 tumour samples and medical records of bowel cancer patients participating in the COIN trial, as well as research carried out in mice, cell cultures, and a laboratory model for pre-malignant colorectal cancer.Co-senior author Andrew Beggs, Professor of Cancer Genetics & Surgery at the University of Birmingham, explained:  About 60% of bowel cancers are sensitive to drugs called anti-EGFR inhibitors which work by blocking a key pathway in these cancers. However, despite this, in cancers that should be sensitive to them, these drugs only work in patients about 50% of the time. Co-senior author Dr Fedor Berditchevski, also of the University of Birmingham, added:  Scientists have previously found that if bowel cancer patients have a mutation in a gene called RAS, the anti-EGFR inhibitors will not work. However, our research has now discovered a new pathway involving a tetraspanin protein called TSPAN6 that is frequently inactive in bowel cancer patients and this makes these drugs less effective. Crucially, our research also shows that if this pathway is active in a patient s cancer then the drug will work, irrespective of whether they have a mutation in RAS or not. First author Dr Regina Andrijes, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Birmingham, concludes:  This is the first time a tetraspanin protein has been shown to be directly involved with bowel cancer. Our research findings show that this new pathway could act as a biomarker for treatment with anti-EGFR drugs in bowel cancer, increasing a patient s chance of survival and the number of patients who could benefit from these drugs who previously would not have.

The work, led by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign atmospheric sciences professor Atul Jain, could help identify the primary plant- and animal-based food sectors contributing to three major greenhouse gas emissions and allow policymakers to take action to reduce emissions from the top-emitting food commodities at different locations across the globe.The comprehensive study examined the four major subsectors for plant- and animal-based food emissions associated with food production processes, including land-use change, farmland management activities, raising livestock and operations that occur once the food leaves the farm from 171 crops and 16 livestock products across the globe. The consistent and unified data-modeling framework allowed the researchers to build an open-access database to estimate all global greenhouse gas emissions   CO2, methane and nitrous oxide   from plant- and animal-based human food. The study findings are published in the journal Nature Food. The study found that food-based agriculture accounts for 35% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. Of that, plant-based foods emissions contribute 29%, consisting of 19% CO2, 6% methane and 4% nitrous oxide emissions; animal-based food emissions contribute 57%, consisting of 32% CO2, 20% methane and 6% nitrous oxide emissions; and nonfood utilization such as cotton and rubber production contributes 14%.  Although CO2 is the most important and most frequently discussed GHG emissions, methane generated by rice cultivation and animals, and nitrous oxide from fertilizers are 34 and 298 times more powerful than CO2, respectively, when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere,  said Xiaoming Xu, a U. of I. postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study. The researchers calculated spatially explicit production- and consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions from human foods worldwide. The study showed that the countries with leading greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based foods are China at 8%, Brazil at 6%, the U.S. at 5% and India at 4%. The countries with leading greenhouse gas emissions from plant-based foods are China at 7%, India at 4% and Indonesia at 2%.  We estimate that population growth will drive the expansion of food subsectors, including crop cultivation and livestock production, as well as product transportation and processing, irrigation and materials like fertilizer and pesticides,  Jain said.  Developing climate mitigation strategies must rely on accurate estimates of GHG emissions from all sources, including those from the production and consumption of total and individual plant- and animal-based foods.  The researchers said they hope this study will encourage everyone   from policymakers to individuals who want to make a difference   to consider the rich opportunity that agricultural systems provide to develop strategies and public policies that can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions before climate change becomes irreversible.ReferenceXu X, Sharma P, Shu S, et al.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-do-tiny-anchors-keep-our-cells-in-place-353596,How Do Tiny Anchors Keep Our Cells in Place  Most of the cells in our bodies are locked into the right place with the help of tiny anchors  These strong anchors use protein chains to link the cell to collagen  the protein that gives structure to our body  Now  scientists have found the specific protein  or link  in the chain responsible for upholding the connection  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Most of the cells in our bodies   be they bone, muscle or pancreas cells   are locked into the right place with the help of tiny anchors (called  focal adhesions ). These strong anchors use protein chains to link the cell to collagen, the protein that gives structure to our body.The anchors help the cells stay put and, for the most part, resist disruptions to their environment   but if a cell morphs into a cancer cell, the chain can break, letting the cancer spread to other parts of the body.Now, for the first time, a team of UNSW Sydney scientists have found the specific protein (or link) in the chain responsible for upholding the connection.The findings, published in Nature Materials, build on our understanding of cell mechanics   and could help give new directions for cancer research. We ve identified the protein that s essential for these attachments to function,  says Ms Maria Lastra Cagigas, lead author of the study and Scientia PhD candidate at UNSW Medicine & Health. If these attachments fail, the cell could be more prone to moving and invading tissues, like cancer. Scientists already knew that cancer weakens cells  anchors in some way, but they didn t know exactly how this happens.One of the reasons it s been so hard to study this is the miniscule size of the anchor s chain: it s only a few nanometres thick   about 1/10,000th the size of a human hair.The team used specialised 3D cryo-electron microscopy   a powerful imaging technique that uses an electron microscope to create high-resolution images of cells   to identify tropomyosin as the key protein in the chain holding the anchor in place. Cryo-electron microscopy is currently the most powerful technique to look at proteins inside cells, and its development won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017. This is the first time we can actually see in detail what the anchor s chain looks like,  says Professor Peter Gunning, co-senior author of the study. The team made the findings at UNSW s Mark Wainwright Electron Microscope Unit, and are the first in the world to use this technique to look at these tropomyosin chains. It s completely new technology. The researchers identified tropomyosin s role in the anchor s chain by comparing normal cells with cells from bone cancer patients, along with cancer cells created in the laboratory.They then tried putting the tropomyosin back into the cancer cells   surprisingly, the anchors managed to attach again. Looking into the future, we want to learn if we can leverage this knowledge to reduce the invasion of cancer cells,  says Ms Lastra Cagigas. In the short term, we could use this information to find out if a cancer has a predisposition to metastasize, which means to move throughout the body. In the long term, we could look into it as a potential target in cancer treatment. Prof. Gunning and co-senior author Professor Edna Hardeman, who have been researching this field of science for 40 years, say it s a milestone in understanding cell mechanics. It's been a real pleasure to watch this work develop,  says Prof. Gunning, who was recently presented with the 2020 President s Medal from the Australian and New Zealand Society for Cell and Developmental Biology (ANZSCDB) for his contribution to research into cell mechanics. It reinforces what has essentially been a lifetime's work for us: understanding the principles of the architecture of cells. A potential drug targetAround 30 per cent of the body is made up of collagen, which forms what s called  the matrix . The matrix is like a scaffold present in our bones, ligaments, muscles, and skin. It s almost everywhere in the body,  says Ms Lastra Cagigas.  Other than the cells that move through our body, like those in blood, the collagen matrix forms the home for most cells   including cancer cells. Pancreatic cancer is one of a few cancers that can modify this matrix for its own benefit by creating a  barrier  around the tumour. This barrier works as a defence mechanism, making it harder for cancer treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy to kill the cancer cells.The tumour forces pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts (or PCAFs)   cells around the tumour that are anchored by chains   to build this defence barrier. But now that scientists have identified the proteins in the cell s anchor and chain, they can explore these proteins as future targets for therapies that could loosen that barrier. We ve identified that the type of protein involved in the chain, tropomyosin, is druggable,  says Prof. Hardeman. This means it s possible to develop small molecule inhibitors, or drugs, that can actually attack these proteins. Prof. Hardeman says it s likely that these potential future drugs would be delivered alongside cancer treatments, so the drugs can temporarily destabilise the barrier while the cancer treatments do their work.Looking aheadWhile the findings are encouraging, Prof. Gunning says it doesn t mean suitable drugs will be available for use in the next few years. We have an understanding of the biology, but to go from that to treating a patient is difficult to predict,  he says. We can see what the path looks like, but we are less sure of the timeline. It s more likely that in the near future   potentially the next two or three years   the protein in the chain, tropomyosin, may help scientists predict which cancers are likely to spread more quickly. As we build on the underlying mechanisms of cancer and expand our markers of cancer cell biology, our discovery adds a missing link to the development of a personalised diagnosis for cancer,  says Prof. Gunning.

Their new models could help researchers develop and test potential drugs for pancreatic cancer, which is currently one of the most difficult types of cancer to treat.Using a specialized gel that mimics the extracellular environment surrounding the pancreas, the researchers were able to grow pancreatic  organoids,  allowing them to study the important interactions between pancreatic tumors and their environment. Unlike some of the gels now used to grow tissue, the new MIT gel is completely synthetic, easy to assemble and can be produced with a consistent composition every time. The issue of reproducibility is a major one,  says Linda Griffith, the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation and a professor of biological engineering and mechanical engineering.  The research community has been looking for ways to do more methodical cultures of these kinds of organoids, and especially to control the microenvironment. The researchers have also shown that their new gel can be used to grow other types of tissue, including intestinal and endometrial tissue.Griffith and Claus Jorgensen, a group leader at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, are the senior authors of the paper, which appears in Nature Materials. The lead author is Christopher Below, a former graduate student at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute.Mimicking the microenvironmentTraditionally, labs have used commercially available tissue-derived gel to grow organoids in a lab dish. However, as the most widely used commercial gel is a complex mixture of proteins, proteoglycans, and growth factors derived from a tumor grown in mice, it is variable from lot to lot and has undesirable components present, Griffith says. It also doesn t always allow for growth of multiple types of cells. About 10 years ago, Griffith s lab started to work on designing a synthetic gel that could be used to grow epithelial cells, which form the sheets that line most organs, along with other supportive cells.The gel they developed is based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), a polymer that is often used for medical applications because it doesn t interact with living cells. By studying the biochemical and biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix, which surrounds organs in the body, the researchers were able to identify features they could incorporate into the PEG gel to help cells grow in it.One key feature is the presence of molecules called peptide ligands, which interact with cell surface proteins called integrins. The sticky binding between ligands and integrins allows cells to adhere to the gel and form organoids. The researchers found that incorporating small synthetic peptides derived from fibronectin and collagen in their gels allowed them to grow a variety of epithelial tissues, including intestinal tissue. They showed that supportive cells called stromal cells, along with immune cells, can also thrive in this environment.In the new study, Griffith and Jorgensen wanted to see if the gel could also be used to support the growth of normal pancreatic organoids and pancreatic tumors. Traditionally, it has been difficult to grow pancreatic tissue in a manner that replicates both the cancerous cells and the supporting environment, because once pancreatic tumor cells are removed from the body, they lose their distinctive cancerous traits.Griffith s lab developed a protocol to produce the new gel, and then teamed up with Jorgensen s lab, which studies the biology of pancreatic cancer, to test it. Jorgensen and his students were able to produce the gel and use it to grow pancreatic organoids, using healthy or cancerous pancreatic cells derived from mice. We got the protocol from Linda and we got the reagents in, and then it just worked,  Jorgensen says.  I think that speaks volumes of how robust the system is and how easy it is to implement in the lab. Other approaches they had tried were too complicated or did not recapitulate the microenvironment seen in living tissues, he says. Using this gel, Jorgensen s lab was able to compare the pancreatic organoids to tissues they have studied in living mice, and they found that the tumor organoids express many of the same integrins seen in pancreatic tumors. Furthermore, other types of cells that normally surround tumors, including macrophages (a type of immune cells) and fibroblasts (a type of supportive cells), were also able to grow in the microenvironment.Patient-derived cellsThe researchers also showed that they can use their gel to grow organoids from pancreatic cancer cells from patients. They believe it could also be useful for studying lung, colorectal, and other cancers. Such systems could be used to analyze how potential cancer drugs affect tumors and their microenvironment.Griffith also plans to use the gel to grow and study tissue from patients with endometriosis, a condition that causes the tissue that lines the uterus to grow outside the uterus. This can lead to pain and sometimes infertility.One of the advantages of the new gel is that it is completely synthetic, and can be made easily in a lab by mixing together specific precursors, including PEG and some polypeptides. The researchers have filed a patent on the technology and are in the process of licensing it to a company that could produce the gel commercially.Reference: Below CR, Kelly J, Brown A, et al.

By finding cancer before signs and symptoms even appear, we have the best chance of treating it and we can give people the best possible chance of survival. The NHS has a successful track record of leading the way on innovations in cancer diagnosis and treatment, from CAR-T therapy to COVID-friendly drugs. The Galleri blood test, if successful, could play a major part in achieving our NHS Long Term Plan ambition to catch three quarters of cancers at an early stage, when they are easier to treat. So if you are invited, please take part   you could be helping us to revolutionise cancer care and protect yourself. Dame Cally Palmer, NHS National Director for Cancer, said:  It is an absolute priority to speed up the earlier detection of cancer to improve survival, and this trial has the potential to do just that across a range of types of cancer. We are very grateful to all the people who will be taking part in this important initiative, which could help us save many more lives in the future. The test is a simple blood test that research has shown is particularly effective at finding cancers that are typically difficult to identify early   such as head and neck, bowel, lung, pancreatic, and throat cancers.It works by finding chemical changes in fragments of genetic code-cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that leak from tumours into the bloodstream. The NHS is already sending out letters inviting tens of thousands of people from different backgrounds and ethnicities aged between 50 and 77 to take part.Participants, who must not have had a cancer diagnosis in the last three years, will be asked to give a blood sample at a locally based mobile clinic and they will then be invited back after 12 months, and again at two years, to give further samples. The trial is part of the NHS s efforts to increase the proportion of cancers detected early by the end of the Long Term Plan.The NHS-Galleri trial is being run by The Cancer Research UK and King s College London Cancer Prevention Trials Unit in partnership with the NHS and healthcare company, GRAIL, which has developed the Galleri test.It is operating with the support of eight NHS Cancer Alliances across England that span Cheshire and Merseyside, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, the North East, West Midlands, East Midlands, East of England, Kent and Medway, and South East London. For the purposes of the trial, only people living in these areas will be invited.Initial results of the study are expected by 2023 and, if successful, the NHS in England plans to extend the rollout to a further one million people in 2024 and 2025.Patients whose cancer is found early   known as stage one or two   typically have a broader range of treatment options available to them, which can be curative and are often less aggressive.A patient whose cancer is diagnosed at the earliest stage typically has between five and 10 times the chance of surviving compared with those found at  stage four. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: The UK s world leading scientists continue to pioneer innovative cancer diagnosis and treatments so our brilliant NHS staff have the tools to spot the disease as early as possible and give people the care they need. Early diagnosis can save lives and this revolutionary new test can detect cancers before symptoms even appear, giving people the best possible chance of beating the disease. Ensuring fewer people need treatment for advanced cancer is vital for patient care and another example of the NHS innovating to be more efficient   which will be crucial in bringing down the backlog. Prof Peter Sasieni, Director of The Cancer Research UK & King s College London Cancer Prevention Trials Unit and one of the trial s lead investigators, said:  We need to study the Galleri test carefully to find out whether it can significantly reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at a late stage. The test could be a game-changer for early cancer detection and we are excited to be leading this important research.Cancer screening can find cancers earlier when they are more likely to be treated successfully, but not all types of screening work. The NHS-Galleri study is a Randomised Control Trial (RCT)   meaning that half the participants will have their blood sample screened with the Galleri test right away and the other half will have their sample stored and may be tested in the future. This will allow scientists to compare the stage at which cancer is detected between the two groups.People will only know they re in the test group if they are among the small minority whose test detects potential signals of cancer in their blood. These people will be contacted by the trial nurse by phone and referred to an NHS hospital for further tests.All participants will be advised to continue with their standard NHS screening appointments and to still contact their GP if they notice any new or unusual symptoms.Sir Harpal Kumar, President of GRAIL Europe, said:  We re delighted to partner with the NHS to support the NHS Long Term Plan for earlier cancer diagnosis, and we are eager to bring our technology to people in the UK as quickly as we can. The Galleri test can not only detect a wide range of cancer types but can also predict where the cancer is in the body with a high degree of accuracy. The test is particularly strong at detecting deadly cancers and has a very low rate of false positives.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

However, the team of neuroscientists have now shown that it can also help translating foreign language words into one s native language.  Their study has been published recently in the renowned Journal of Neuroscience.Participants in the study learned foreign language words by performing semantically-related gestures over four days of training. After the training, the participants heard the words that they had learned and were asked to translate them into their native language. A neuroscience technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in which magnetic pulses stimulate specific brain areas, was used to interfere with processing in the motor cortex during the translation task. The scientists found that this interference slowed down the translation of words learned with gestures. This slowing was not observed in response to the control TMS, which does not interfere with motor cortex processing. In an additional control condition, participants learned foreign language words by viewing pictures, whose translation was unaffected by TMS applied to the motor cortex.The motor cortex contributed to the translation of foreign language vocabulary after a relatively brief period of gesture-based training, suggesting that performing gestures may be a valuable tool for picking up new words in a foreign language more quickly.  Interestingly, the effect occurred for both concrete words such as violin and abstract words such as democracy. Taken together, the findings suggest that our memory for recently-learned foreign language words depends on the sensorimotor context in which the words were experienced during learning,  explains first author Brian Mathias.  Many often-used teaching methods for learning new foreign language vocabulary rely on only audio or visual information, such as studying written word lists. Our findings shed light on why learning techniques that integrate the body s motor system typically outperform these other learning strategies. Reference: Mathias B, Waibel A, Hartwigsen G, et al.

The research, published today in Applied and Environmental  Microbiology raises the possibility of converting atmospheric CO2 to commodity chemicals. Normally, an enzyme in E. coli catalyzes the reverse of this reaction production of H2 and CO2 from formic acid. In nature, the latter is best known as a type of vinegar compound ants use to ward off predators (Formic comes from the Latin 'formica,"" meaning ant.) To reverse the normal reaction in E. coli, the investigators got the bacteria to switch out molybdenum, a metal that is normally a critical part of the enzyme, for tungsten, by growing the bacteria in an excess of the latter. ""This is fairly easy to do as E. coli cannot readily tell the difference between the 2,"" said principal investigator Frank Sargent. ""Swapping of tungsten for molybdenum changed the properties of our enzyme so that it was locked in CO2 capturing mode rather than being able to switch between CO2 capture and CO2 production,"" said Dr. Sargent. The investigators used a special pressurized bioreactor filled with H2 and CO2 to make the gases available to the microbes. ""It worked the bacteria could grow under gas pressure and generate formic acid from the CO2,"" said Dr. Sargent. Dr. Sargent developed the idea from reading about the emergence of life on Earth, both in primary literature and popular science books, he said. Three and a half billion years ago, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, but there were high levels of CO2 and H2, and cellular life had begun evolving 10,000 meters below the ocean s surface. Back then, these compounds would have needed to be converted into the carbohydrates on which all life depends. That could have been accomplished by an enzyme ""such as the one we found in E. coli, hydrogenating carbon dioxide into an organic acid,"" said Dr. Sargent. ""We wanted to try this in the lab."" ""Around the world, societies understand the importance of combatting climate change, developing sustainable energy sources and reducing waste,"" said Dr. Sargent. ""Reducing carbon dioxide emissions will require a basket of different solutions. Biology and microbiology offer some exciting options."" ""The ultimate aim would be to capture wasted CO2 using renewable hydrogen gas from biohydrogen as in this research or electrolysis powered by renewable electricity, and convert it to formic acid,"" said Dr. Sargent. ""The key is for a microbe to use formate as its sole carbon source. Then we can make fuel, plastic or chemicals. This is the vision of a truly cyclic bioeconomy where CO2 is constantly produced, captured and returned to the market.""ReferenceRoger M, Reed TCP, Sargent F.

Now, scientists at MIT s McGovern Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have discovered a new class of programmable DNA modifying systems called OMEGAs (Obligate Mobile Element Guided Activity), which may naturally be involved in shuffling small bits of DNA throughout bacterial genomes.These ancient DNA-cutting enzymes are guided to their targets by small pieces of RNA. While they originated in bacteria, they have now  been engineered to work in human cells, suggesting they could be useful in the development of gene editing therapies, particularly as they are small (~30% the size of Cas9), making them easier to deliver to cells than bulkier enzymes. The discovery, reported September 9, 2021, in the journal Science, provides evidence that natural RNA-guided enzymes are among the most abundant proteins on earth, pointing toward a vast new area of biology that is poised to drive the next revolution in genome editing technology.The research was led by McGovern Investigator Feng Zhang, who is the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and a Core Institute Member of the Broad Institute. Zhang s team has been exploring natural diversity in search of new molecular systems that can be rationally programmed. We are super excited about the discovery of these widespread programmable enzymes, which have been hiding under our noses all along,  says Zhang.  These results suggest the tantalizing possibility that there are many more programmable systems that await discovery and development as useful technologies. Natural adaptationProgrammable enzymes, particularly those that use an RNA guide, can be rapidly adapted for different uses. For example, CRISPR enzymes naturally use an RNA guide to target viral invaders, but biologists can direct Cas9 to any target by generating their own RNA guide.  It s so easy to just change a guide sequence and set a new target,  says graduate student and co-first author of the paper, Soumya Kannan.  So one of the broad questions that we re interested in is trying to see if other natural systems use that same kind of mechanism. The first hints that OMEGA proteins might be directed by RNA came from the genes for proteins called IscBs. The IscBs are not involved in CRISPR immunity and were not known to associate with RNA, but they looked like small, DNA-cutting enzymes. The team discovered that each IscB had a small RNA encoded nearby and it directed IscB enzymes to cut specific DNA sequences. They named these RNAs  RNAs. The team s experiments showed that two other classes of small proteins known as IsrBs and TnpBs, one of the most abundant genes in bacteria, also use  RNAs that act as guides to direct the cleavage of DNA. IscB, IsrB, and TnpB are found in mobile genetic elements called transposons. Graduate student Han Altae-Tran, co-first author on the paper, explains that each time these transposons move, they create a new guide RNA, allowing the enzyme they encode to cut somewhere else.It s not clear how bacteria benefit from this genomic shuffling or whether they do at all.  Transposons are often thought of as selfish bits of DNA, concerned only with their own mobility and preservation, Kannan says. But if hosts can  co-opt  these systems and repurpose them, hosts may gain new abilities, as with CRISPR systems which confer adaptive immunity.  A lot of the things that we have been thinking about may already exist naturally in some capacity,  says Altae-Tran. IscBs and TnpBs appear to be predecessors of Cas9 and Cas12 CRISPR systems. The team suspects they, along with IsrB, likely gave rise to other RNA-guided enzymes, too and they are eager to find them. They are curious about the range of functions that might be carried out in nature by RNA-guided enzymes, Kannan says, and suspect evolution likely already took advantage of OMEGA enzymes like IscBs and TnpBs to solve problems that biologists are keen to tackle. A lot of the things that we have been thinking about may already exist naturally in some capacity,  says Altae-Tran.  Natural versions of these types of systems might be a good starting point to adapt for that particular task. The team is also interested in tracing the evolution of RNA-guided systems further into the past.  Finding all these new systems sheds light on how RNA-guided systems have evolved, but we don t know where RNA-guided activity itself comes from,  Altae-Tran says. Understanding those origins, he says, could pave the way to developing even more classes of programmable tools.This work was made possible with support from the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT; National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program; National Institutes of Health grants 1R01-HG009761 and 1DP1-HL141201; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Open Philanthropy; G.

Healthy individuals vary substantially in their ability to utilize cognitive control, and many neuropsychiatric disorders have been linked to cognitive control problems.But there s quite a bit that researchers still don t know: exactly how and why does cognitive control vary from person to person? Which areas of the brain are involved? How does brain activity relate to behavior?Todd Braver, professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts & Sciences, along with appointments in radiology and neuroscience at the School of Medicine, at Washington University in St. Louis, is working to answer those questions. He and his research team believe they have developed a more robust research method, and they recently published the first of what promises to be many studies examining the brain basis of cognitive control both in individuals and across groups.  Their initial findings were published online Aug. 19 for the September issue of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. When it comes to researching cognitive control, a typical study involves looking at how the subjects tackle one or two laboratory tasks. The results are then generalized to apply to the larger question researchers are interested in. We all kind of know it s not the most valid approach,  Braver said. That s because the cognitive control necessary to perform one task under one circumstance may not be indicative of different types of tasks under different circumstances.  But because of its simplicity, that s how the field standardly tackles these types of research questions. To try to obtain more generalizable results, Braver devised a research framework which not only uses a full battery of cognitive tests, but also looks at them across a variety of conditions. We re looking across a set of tasks, and then also trying to see how each person performs when encouraged to use different modes of control,  he said. Each person performed four tasks across three different conditions while being monitored with functional MRI. Functional MRI measures changes in blood flow across the whole brain to identify the areas that were most impacted by the tests.Braver found the differences in cognitive control seemed to be differences of degree   common patterns were found in both the brains and the behavior of most of the 80 subjects. We found consistency across the four tasks in these brain regions,  Braver said,  but people varied in degree.  Most importantly, and as expected, the changes in brain activity were mirrored by changes in task performance levels: the participants varied in the way they engaged their cognitive control. Together, these findings suggest to the research team that the results are more generalizable. That s what we care about,  he said,  because we think that effective utilization of cognitive control should more generally result in enhanced performance. The four tests are psychology standards: a Stroop task; an AX-CPT task; a Cued-TS paradigm; and a Sternberg task.All four tasks were performed under three conditions. The baseline condition was akin to a pop quiz; participants did not know when cognitive control demands would occur. There was a proactive condition, in which participants knew in advance that their cognitive control would be necessary for the task, and could prepare accordingly.Finally, in the reactive condition, participants did not know in advance about the control demands, but were clued in quickly on certain types of trials by the features that were present. It s like when you see a stop sign,  Braver said. You don t know before you see it that you need to stop, but as soon as you detect the red color or octagon shape, you begin slowing down.Imaging showed that participants  brains were in distinct states in each of the three conditions, indicating that there is a qualitative difference when it comes to engaging cognitive control in different situations.Those who dealt better with the tasks, across any of the conditions, also showed the most consistent signature in brain activity. But regardless of people s performance, brain states clustered around similar activity patterns.This research is the beginning of what Braver hopes will be a robust understanding, first, of the workings of a healthy brain. I don t think it s smart to start studying clinical populations without first having an understanding of how cognitive control functions in healthy brains,  he said. We know that cognitive control shows some of the biggest variations even among the healthy, so we wanted to develop a basic level of understanding in healthy young adults before we branch out. Nevertheless, Braver and his research team have broad ambitions for this work, with some of the data already made publicly available, so that researchers working in related areas can begin to make use of it. Additional planned studies will expand the focus to understand the genetic basis of cognitive control in identical twins; whether mindfulness training can improve cognitive control function; and the relationship between anxiety and cognitive control. We believe that our work and data already provide a valuable resource to the scientific community,  Braver said.  And we are hoping that both our team and others can build on this foundation, in order to understand, more fully, why cognitive control is so important, but also so variable, among people.

That data also indicate that Moderna s vaccine is significantly more effective against Delta than Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. These real-world data show that vaccines remain highly effective at reducing COVID-19 related hospitalizations and emergency department visits, even in the presence of the new COVID-19 variant,  said study author Shaun Grannis, M.D., M.S., Regenstrief Institute vice president for data and analytics and professor of medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine.  We strongly recommend vaccinations for all who are eligible to reduce serious illness and ease the burden on our healthcare system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) s VISION Network analyzed more than 32,000 medical encounters from nine states during June, July and August 2021, when the Delta variant became the predominant strain. The results showed that unvaccinated individuals with COVID-19 are 5-7 times more likely to need emergency department care or hospitalization, similar to the overall effectiveness prior to the variant. The study in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report is also the first analysis from the VISION Network to show a marked difference between the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer). In the study s time period:  The study also found that vaccine effectiveness is lower for people 75 years and older, which has not been shown in previous research. This could be due to a range of factors, including the increased time since vaccination. When it came to preventing emergency department and urgent care visits, analysis showed that:  Scientists say these findings need further monitoring and evaluation. Despite the differences in effectiveness, vaccines continue to offer much more protection than not getting one at all,  said Dr. Grannis.  While breakthrough cases do happen, data shows the symptoms are less severe. The vast majority of COVID hospitalizations and deaths continue to be among unvaccinated individuals. COVID-19 vaccines are powerful tools for combating the pandemic. The VISION network, funded by the CDC, includes seven organizations that contribute and analyze data from U.S. healthcare systems to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. In addition to Regenstrief Institute, other members are Columbia University Irving Medical Center, HealthPartners, Intermountain Healthcare, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Northwest and University of Colorado.

The findings were published in the journal, The Public Library of Science ONE (PLOS ONE).At the heart of the team s findings is an antibody that shows up weeks after an initial infection and attacks and disrupts a key regulator of the immune system, said lead researcher John Arthur, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chief of the Division of Nephrology in the UAMS College of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine. As many as 30% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering fatigue, brain fog and shortness of breath. The cause of long COVID-19 has eluded scientists, but the UAMS team s discovery sheds important new light on the molecular-level mechanisms behind it.  Everything that we ve found is consistent with this antibody as the instigator of long COVID, so it s an exciting development that merits further study,  Arthur said. The antibody creates problems for the immune system by attacking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 enzyme helps regulate the body s response to the virus by metabolizing a peptide that activates the immune system. The attacking antibody interferes with ACE2 s work, which makes the antibody a prime suspect for the long-lasting illness. The research team was brought together quickly this spring by the UAMS Translational Research Institute to test the hypothesis that developed through discussions between Arthur and UAMS  Terry Harville, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Pathology and medical director of the Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratories. Researchers Karl Boehme, Ph.D., Craig Forrest, Ph.D., and Shana Owens, Ph.D., in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology developed the assay (test) used to identify the two antibodies. Researchers tested plasma or serum for ACE2 antibodies in 67 patients with known SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection and 13 with no history of infection. In 81% of blood samples from patients in Arkansas and Oklahoma with a history of COVID-19, the samples had the antibody that attacked the ACE2.In participants with no history of COVID-19, no antibodies were created to attack the ACE2 enzyme.  If we show that the whole hypothesis is right, that this interference of ACE2 really does cause long COVID, then it opens up many potential treatments,  Arthur said.  If our next steps confirm that this antibody is the cause of long COVID symptoms, there are medications that should work to treat them. If we get to that phase of research, the next step would be to test these drugs and hopefully relieve people of the symptoms they re having.  The multidisciplinary team also includes College of Medicine researchers Christian Herzog, Ph.D., Department of Internal Medicine; Josh Kennedy, M.D., Department of Pediatrics; and Juan Liu, Ph.D., from the Department of Pathology.  This is true team science,  Arthur said.  We put together a great group of investigators that had never worked together to produce these very exciting results. ReferenceArthur JM et al.

Their findings, published this week in PNAS, could one day aid diagnosis and treatment of dementia. Metabolites are chemical substances produced by vital chemical reactions that occur within cells and tissues,  said first author Dr. Takayuki Teruya, who works in the G0 Cell Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST).  Our body normally keeps these levels in balance, but as we age and if we develop diseases like dementia, these levels can fluctuate and change. Dementia is not just a single disease, but a general term used to describe a set of symptoms, including a slow but typically irreversible decline in the ability to remember, think, make decisions or perform day-to-day activities. Of all aging-associated diseases, dementia is one of the most serious, not only for the patients and their family but for society as a whole, with an estimated 55 million people living with the disease worldwide.While scientists know that dementia is caused by damage to nerves, the exact cause of this damage, and methods as to how it can be detected and treated have remained elusive.In the study, the research team analyzed samples of blood collected from eight patients with dementia, as well as eight healthy elderly people. They also collected samples from eight healthy young people to use as a reference. Unlike most studies analyzing blood metabolites, this research included compounds found within red blood cells. Blood cells are difficult to handle because they undergo metabolic changes if left untreated even for a short period of time,  explained Dr. Teruya.However, the research team recently developed a way to stabilize metabolites in red blood cells, allowing them to examine for the first time the relationship between red blood cell activity and dementia.The scientists measured the levels of 124 different metabolites in whole blood and found that 33 metabolites, split into 5 different sub-groups, correlated with dementia. Seven of these compounds increased in dementia patients, whilst 26 of these compounds showed a decrease in levels. 20, including nine that were abundant in red blood cells, of these compounds had not previously been linked to dementia. Identification of these compounds means that we are one step closer to being able to molecularly diagnose dementia,  said senior author of the study, Professor Mitsuhiro Yanagida, who leads the G0 Cell Unit at OIST.The seven metabolites that showed increased levels in patients with dementia were found within the blood plasma and belonged to sub-group A of metabolites. Importantly, some of these compounds are believed to have toxic effects on the central nervous system. It s still too early to say, but it could suggest a possible mechanistic cause of dementia as these compounds may lead to impairment of the brain,  said Prof. Yanagida.The research team plans to test this idea in the next steps of their research, by seeing if increases in these metabolites can induce dementia in animal models, like mice.The remaining 26 compounds that decreased in patients with dementia, compared to healthy elderly people, belonged to four other metabolite sub-groups, B-E.Six metabolites that decreased in dementia patients were classified into sub-group B, due to their similar structure.  These metabolic compounds are antioxidants, which protect cells and tissues by reducing damage caused by free radicals   unstable molecules produced by chemical reactions in cells.  The researchers found that these antioxidant compounds derived from food were highly abundant in red blood cells of healthy elderly people. It could be that red blood cells deliver not only oxygen but also crucial metabolites that protect the nervous system from damage,  said Dr. Teruya.The remaining sub-groups contain compounds that the researchers believe play a role in supplying nutrients, maintaining energy reserves and protecting neurons from damage. In the future, we hope to start some intervention studies, either by supplementing dementia patients with metabolic compounds in sub-groups B-E, or by inhibiting the neurotoxins from sub-group A, to see if that can slow, prevent, or even reverse symptoms of dementia,  said Prof. Yanagida.Reference: Teruya T, Chen Y-J, Kondoh H, Fukuji Y, Yanagida M.

They could one day be used to power a data center.As the world works toward economically and environmentally friendly ways to power these devices, two Virginia Tech researchers investigate how food waste and its associated biomass can be converted into rechargeable batteries.  This research could be a piece of the puzzle in solving the sustainable energy problems for rechargeable batteries,  said project co-lead Haibo Huang, an associate professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.  Demand for these reusable batteries has skyrocketed and we need to find a way to reduce the environmental impacts of batteries.  The research is funded through a three-year, $450,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture Foundational and Applied Science Program with the priority area of bioprocessing and bioengineering. The grant runs through April 2023. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers found that the fiber component in food waste was the key to develop an advanced carbon materials that could be used as a battery anode, the negative terminal on a battery.  Our unique approach of using agricultural waste-derived carbon materials to host alkali metal, such as lithium and sodium, will bring major advances to agricultural waste processing and battery technology,  said Feng Lin, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and the project s principal investigator. This research will advance the utilization of agricultural wastes generated in agricultural systems for value-added carbon production and ultimately energy storage devices. The team uses highly tunable, abundant, and cost-effective raw materials to address the need in the energy storage field. Using waste-derived carbon materials as the host for metal anodes could significantly reduce alkali metal usage per battery.Not long ago, Huang and Lin played a game of pickup basketball when the idea struck them.  We thought why not convert food waste into battery materials because of how much food waste there is across the globe,  Huang said.  Most of these wastes are put into garbage and then sent to landfills. We just need to solve the battery side.  There s a heavy reliance on graphite   a limited resource   to make battery anodes. The researchers first tested different types of food waste material to see if any could be used to make batteries.  As a food processing engineer, I can modify the composition of the food,  Huang said.  I could take the proteins and lipids out, along with some of the minerals, to see how it impacts battery performance.  The researchers found that when certain compounds were removed from the equation, the essential compounds of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin after thermal treatment could sufficiently work for a battery. This research will advance the utilization of agricultural wastes generated in agricultural systems for value-added carbon production and ultimately energy storage devices.

The final step will be an economic analysis on the feasibility of implementing this technology to ensure usage when pushed to the market. The anticipated initial uses of the technology are for affordable energy storage solutions for data centers or other large energy storage facilities where the size of the battery is not a factor. As they progress, the researchers hope to be able to turn food waste into a carbon that lacks the impurities experienced today.  We have the opportunity to solve two urgent issues in two different industries,  Huang said.  A lot of energy is already put into the production and transportation of food in the food supply chain. We must recover the value from food waste. This is the perfect opportunity, as battery production looks for different materials than the traditional carbon.  While they may not solve the problem of having to replace batteries in the TV remote just yet, the team is helping the technology get closer to having food waste power the devices people use daily. Just don't underestimate the power of apple waste, spent grain, and walnut shells.This article has been republished from the following materials.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/lymph-node-centric-paradigm-of-killer-t-cell-priming-challenged-353564,Lymph Node Centric Paradigm of Killer T Cell Priming Challenged The long held paradigm that priming during lung infections takes place only in the draining lymph nodes has been upended  and it will be key to developing more efficient vaccinations and therapies for respiratory challenges  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. CD8+ T cells   known as  killer  T cells   are the assassins of the immune system. Once they are primed, they seek out and destroy other cells that are infected with virus or cells that are cancerous. Priming involves dendritic cells   sentinels of the immune system. In an influenza infection in the lungs, for example, lung-migratory dendritic cells capture a piece of the viral antigen, and then migrate out of the lung to the place where na ve T cells reside, to present that antigen to the CD8+ T cells. This primes the T cells to know which cells to attack. The place for the priming in influenza had long been thought to be restricted to a single anatomical site   the lung-draining, mediastinal lymph nodes that lie between the lungs and the spine. This lymph node-centric paradigm now has been challenged in a paper published in the journal Science Immunology. Researchers led by Andr  Ballesteros-Tato, Ph.D., associate professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Medicine Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, have found an unnoticed additional site for priming of CD8+ T cells   the spleen. This is surprising and important. Surprising because there is no lymph vasculature connection between the lungs and the spleen. Important, says Ballesteros-Tato, because CD8+ T cells primed there are transcriptionally distinct and become destined for an alternative fate compared to the T cells in the lymph nodes. CD8+ T cells primed in the lymph nodes are poised to become T effector cells that will return to the lungs to fight infection. But those primed in the spleen generate precursors with an enhanced ability to differentiate into long-lived, stem-like memory T cells. Such memory cells are capable of a quick response to a future infection by the flu virus, thus providing enduring protective immunity.  We demonstrate that CD8+ T cells, responding to the same antigen in different anatomical locations, gives rise to cells with distinct functional capabilities,  Ballesteros-Tato said,  thereby providing a new  anatomical model  for how T cell diversity is generated after infection.  Our results demonstrate a dendritic cell-trafficking pathway that connects the lung with the blood circulation and identify the spleen as a primary site for the priming of long-lived memory T cell precursors,  he said.  These data will be critical for the development of more efficient vaccination and therapeutic strategies to respiratory challenges.  The UAB researchers, using a mouse/influenza virus infection model, found that priming in the spleen was done by a fraction of the migratory lung dendritic cells that egress the lymph node, enter the blood stream and home to the spleen. Besides transcriptional differences for primed T cells in the spleen, fate-mapping experiments showed that spleen-primed CD8+ T cells were long-lived and contributed substantially to the pool of long-lived memory cells, as compared to CD8+ T cells primed in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Ballesteros-Tato and colleagues further showed that 45 days after infection, when spleen-primed CD8+ T cells and lymph node-primed CD8+ T cells were phenotypically indistinguishable, the spleen-primed T cells had superior capacity to respond to a rechallenge infection of influenza virus and expand into a population of infection-fighting T effector cells. Among experimental results supporting their new paradigm, researchers found that, when dendritic cells were unable to migrate out of the lung, or when lymph node egress was inhibited, dendritic cells bearing lung-derived antigens failed to accumulate in the spleen, thereby preventing splenic T cell priming. But how do the lung migratory dendritic cells get from the lymph nodes to the spleen?  Neither the mediastinal lymph nodes nor the lungs are directly connected to the spleen by the lymphatic vasculature,  Ballesteros-Tato said.  Thus, the only possible route for migratory dendritic cells to access the spleen from the mediastinal lymph nodes is via the thoracic duct, which channels the efferent lymph back into the blood circulation.  Ballesteros-Tato noted that most of the knowledge about stem-like CD8+ T cells has come from work in tumor models or chronic systemic viral infections.  To this day,  he said,  no studies have been performed to address the question of how these cells are generated in the context of respiratory viral infections.

Active smoking is associated with increased severity of disease, but at the same time, many reports have suggested lower numbers of COVID cases amongst smokers than amongst non-smokers. Something strange was going on here,  said Keiji Tanimoto of Hiroshima University s Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, the corresponding author of the paper.  But we had a few ideas about how to tease out what some of the mechanisms at work might be. We must stress the presence of strong evidence showing that smoking increases the severity of COVID-19,  Tanimoto added.  But the mechanism we discovered here is worth further investigation as a potential tool to fight SARS-CoV-2 infections. It is known that cigarette smoke contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These can bind to and activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs). A receptor is any structure of the surface or inside of a cell that is shaped to receive and bind to a particular substance. AHRs are a type of receptor inside of mammalian cells that is in turn a transcription factor   something that can induce a wide range of cellular activities through its ability to increase or decrease the expression of certain genes.Knowing this about the relationship between PAHs and AHRs, the researchers wanted to investigate the effect of drugs that activate AHR on expression of the genes that control production of the ACE2 protein   the infamous receptor protein on the surface of many cells types that works like a lock that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to pick. After binding the virus to the ACE2 protein, it can then enter and infect the cell.First, the scientists investigated various cell lines to examine their gene expression levels of ACE2. They found that those cells originating in the oral cavity, lungs and liver had the highest ACE2 expression.These high-ACE2-expression cells were then subjected to various doses of cigarette-smoke extract (CSE) for 24 hours. After this, the rate of expression of the CYP1A1 gene, which is known to be inducible by CSE, was evaluated. The CSE treatment had induced increased expression of CYP1A1 gene in liver and lung cells in a dose-dependent manner   the greater the dose, the greater the effect. However, this effect was not as pronounced in oral cavity cells. In other words, greater activity of the CYP1A1, less production of the ACE2 receptors   the route that the virus is able to enter cells.In order to explain why this was happening in the presence of cigarette smoke, the researchers then used RNA sequencing analysis to investigate what was happening with gene expression more comprehensively. They found that CSE increased the expressions of genes related to a number of key signalling processes within the cell that are regulated by AHR.To more directly observe this mechanism by which AHR acts on ACE2 expression, the effects of two drugs that can activate AHR were evaluated on the liver cells. The first, 6 formylindolo(3,2 b)carbazole (FICZ) is derivative of the amino acid tryptophan, and the second, omeprazole (OMP), is a medication already widely used in the treatment of acid reflux and peptic ulcers.RNA sequencing data suggested that the CYP1A1 gene was strongly induced in liver cells by these AHR activators, and expression of the ACE2 gene was strongly inhibited, again in a dose-dependent manner.In other words, the cigarette smoke extract and these two drugs all of which act as activators of AHR are able to suppress the expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells, and by doing so, reduce the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter the cell.Based on the findings in the lab, the team is now proceeding with pre-clinical and clinical trials on the drugs as a novel anti-COVID-19 therapy.Reference: Tanimoto K, Hirota K, Fukazawa T, et al.

About 300 hunter-gatherer societies persisted into recent history and were documented by ethnographers. Due to similarities between their lifestyles and those of our foraging ancestors, these contemporary hunter-gatherers have provided much information about our species' past.  Because they subsisted on natural food resources through hunting, gathering and fishing, they were closely dependent on the primary productivity of their local ecosystems and, therefore, on the climate variability of the area. But the documented population sizes were often either larger or smaller than would be expected from the local ecosystem productivity, for reasons that were poorly understood. The new study, published today in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, uses a complex set of calculations to show that differences in the amount of meat in diets can explain why some societies were less densely populated than others. In regions with harsh winters or large dry seasons, the available edible vegetation was greatly reduced during a large segment of the year, leaving the hunter-gatherers highly dependent on meat consumption. Because animals tend to be less abundant than edible plants, they can only provide enough food for a small human population. In contrast, the populations settled in places where climate favoured the abundance of plant foods throughout the year were able to take fuller advantage of the overall production in the environment to grow more numerous.  Basically, if people had to live through long dry or cold seasons when plant food was scarce, they were stuck hunting relatively sparse animals to survive,  explains Eric Galbraith, researcher at the ICTA-UAB and at McGill University in Canada.  This led to a seasonal bottleneck in the amount of food available, which then set the overall limit on the population size, no matter how much food there was during the plentiful times.  Previous studies have used statistical methods based on ethnographic records of contemporary hunter-gatherers to build correlations between population density and environmental variables, which allowed them to estimate spatiotemporal patterns of ancient humans. However, these statistical models are limited to the inputs they are given, and had not picked up on the growing season length as an important feature.  Moving beyond pure statistical correlations, we developed a process-based hunter-gatherer model that is coupled to a global terrestrial biosphere model. The mathematical model simulates daily human foraging activities (gathering and hunting) and the resultant carbon (energy) flows between vegetation, animals, and hunter-gatherers, the outcome of which determines human reproduction and mortality rates and thus population dynamics , explains Eric Galbraith, researcher at the ICTA-UAB and at McGill University in Canada.  We were struck to find that   despite a long list of unknowns   a very strong result emerged from the model equations: wherever growing seasons were short, hunter-gatherers required high fractions of meat in the diet. As a result, there could be as much as 100-fold decrease in human population density given the same annual total vegetation productivity, mostly due to the energetic inefficiency of passing through additional predator-prey links,  explains Dan Zhu, lead author of this study, former postdoctoral researcher at the ICTA-UAB and now an assistant professor at Peking University.  When we then went back to the detailed ethnographic observations, we found that this result was well supported by contemporary hunter-gatherers including the Ache in the tropical forest, the Hiwi in the savannah, and the Bushmen groups in the Kalahari Desert, but its importance had not been realized.   This study is an exciting example of how thinking about humans as a part of the ecosystem, rather than something apart, can help us to learn about ourselves,  says Eric Galbraith.  Next, we plan to apply this type of model to the past, to explore how human populations have changed at different time and in different parts of the world, under the slowly changing climates of ancient times , Zhu adds.ReferenceZhu D, Galbraith ED, Reyes-Garc a V, Ciais P.

The global HCA initiative is mapping every cell type in the human body, to transform our knowledge of biology, infection and disease.A new large-scale study mapped the cells in the human gut from early development through to adulthood, creating the most comprehensive Cell Atlas of the Gut to date. This revealed that Crohn s disease may be caused by activation of developmental pathways, and uncovered potential drug targets for treating Crohn s and other Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. The detailed maps will help explain how the gut forms and functions, and will transform research into intestinal diseases.The second publication reveals the hugely ambitious plan to create an entire Human Developmental Cell Atlas (HDCA) of all cells that are important for healthy human development. The gut is just one example of the importance of this, and researchers from the Human Cell Atlas Developmental Biological Network and their collaborators worldwide, show how they will chart developing tissues comprehensively in space and time. Key to understanding what happens in early development and how this can affect health or lead to disease, the HDCA is likely to lead to transformations in healthcare.The gut is a complicated tissue made of multiple cell types, and changes enormously during early development. To understand how the gut develops and functions, researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Newcastle University, University of Cambridge and their collaborators within the Human Cell Atlas, studied more than a third of a million individual gut cells  from developing tissue and from child and adult donors.Using cutting edge single-cell genomics and spatial analysis techniques, the team revealed which genes were active in each cell, and created a highly extensive Gut Cell Atlas, through time and across 12 regions of the intestines.Dr Kylie James, a senior author on the paper, who carried out the work at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and is now at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Australia. While the gut atlas is one example of how understanding development can shed light on disease, a mammoth effort is already underway to create an entire Human Developmental Cell Atlas (HDCA), to transform our understanding of health and disease. The detailed roadmap of how researchers from the HCA Developmental Biological Network plan to create these genomic reference maps of cells, tissues and organs during different stages of healthy human development is revealed in a perspective paper in Nature.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The three institutions will work together to serve as a national resource for knowledge and expertise in maternal and pediatric pharmacology.While MPRINT will investigate a variety of therapeutics, initial studies at the UC San Diego center will focus on antibiotics. Antibiotics are some of the most frequently used medications by breastfeeding women, and are necessary treatments for many infections. However, their effects on child development via breast milk exposure remain largely unknown. UC San Diego s CET will bring together basic and data scientists, pharmacologists and clinical researchers to study the most commonly prescribed antibiotics and their impact on breast milk and pediatric health,  said Adriana Tremoulet, MD, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine and lead principal investigator for the project. We are particularly excited about the specific focus on breastfeeding and human milk,  said Lars Bode, PhD, professor of pediatrics and director of the Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation Mother-Milk-Infant Center of Research Excellence at UC San Diego School of Medicine, who will lead the MPRINT Milk Analytics Core.  Human milk plays such a vital role at the interface of maternal and infant health. Yet, we know so little about the effects of therapeutics in this critical space. The team will investigate how antibiotics alter the composition of breast milk and impact the infant microbiome, metabolome and immune response. They will also assess whether the components of breast milk influence the effectiveness of therapeutics given to the breastfed babies. Antibiotic resistance is a huge emerging problem,  said Bode.  We also realize how important the microbiome is for short- and long-term health, so you can imagine if you go in with antibiotics that disrupt the baby s microbiome, it may do more harm than good. While it is important to understand the potential consequences of antibiotic use, Bode notes that it is equally important to determine if and when taking these medications is actually safe. My biggest concern is that when a woman is prescribed medications, often the default recommendation is to stop breastfeeding, out of fear of the unknown,  said Bode.  We have learned so much in recent years about the many benefits of breastfeeding for both the infant and the mother. Infants who receive human milk have fewer infections and are also less likely to become obese or suffer from allergies later in life. Women who breastfeed are less likely to develop breast or ovarian cancer. So ideally, we don t want physicians to have to make that recommendation to stop breastfeeding simply because of a gap in knowledge. We always try to protect pregnant and breastfeeding women in the drug development process, but we need research on them in order to protect them,  said Christina Chambers, PhD, MPH, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science.  Fortunately, there has been a dramatic change in the last several years in attitudes towards inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in research, and this is one example.  Chambers will lead clinical studies at the CET and co-direct the Administrative Core with Tremoulet.In addition to these studies of mothers and infants, the center will also conduct computational data science studies and basic research in mice.The funding comes as a result of years of collaboration between physicians and scientists at UC San Diego School of Medicine, as well as Rady Children s Hospital-San Diego where several team members also treat patients. This team of researchers has a long track record of working together on successful projects,  said Bode.  UC San Diego has a highly collaborative environment, and these center grants are only possible when people from different disciplines come together. That intersection is where innovation lives, and I believe it s an absolute strength of our academic medical center.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Using brain tissue from humans, researchers at the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) built a detailed cellular map of chronic MS lesions, identifying genes that play a critical role in lesion repair and revealing potential new therapeutic targets for progressive MS. The study was published in Nature. We identified a set of cells that appear to be driving some of the chronic inflammation seen in progressive MS,  said Daniel Reich, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at NINDS.  These results give us a way to test new therapies that might speed up the brain s healing process and prevent brain damage that occurs over time. Chronic active lesions are characterized by a slow, expanding rim of immune cells called microglia. Microglia normally help protect the brain, but in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, they can become overactive and secrete toxic molecules that damage nerve cells. Other cells found at the edge of the lesions, such as astrocytes and lymphocytes, may also contribute to ongoing tissue damage. Prior studies suggest that microglia are the main culprits behind lesion expansion, but the exact types of cells found near lesions and their biological mechanisms are elusive.To better understand MS lesions, Dr. Reich and his colleagues used single-cell RNA sequencing, a powerful technique which enables researchers to catalog gene activity patterns in individual cells, to examine post-mortem brain tissue of five MS patients and three healthy controls. Samples were provided by the Netherlands Brain Bank, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and the NINDS Neuroimmunology Clinic. Single-cell RNA sequencing technology allows us to do a much deeper dive into the types of cells present in MS lesions,  said Dr. Reich.By analyzing the gene activity profiles of over 66,000 cells from human brain tissue, researchers created the first comprehensive map of cell types involved in chronic lesions, as well as their gene expression patterns and interactions.Dr. Reich s team found a great diversity of cell types in the tissue surrounding chronic active lesions compared to normal tissue, and a high proportion of immune cells and astrocytes at the active edges of those lesions. Microglia comprised 25% of all immune cells present at the lesion edges. Our dataset is very rich. The beauty of having such a detailed map is that now we have a better understanding of the entire network of cells involved in smoldering inflammation,  said Martina Absinta, M.D., Ph.D., a former post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Reich s lab and current adjunct assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, who led the study.More detailed analyses revealed that the gene for complement component 1q (C1q), an important and evolutionarily ancient protein of the immune system, was expressed mainly by a subgroup of microglia responsible for driving inflammation, suggesting that it may contribute to lesion progression.To determine the function of C1q, researchers knocked out the gene in the microglia of mouse models of MS and examined the brain tissue for signs of neuroinflammation. In mice lacking microglial C1q, they found significantly decreased tissue inflammation compared to control animals. Additionally, in another group of animals, blocking C1q reduced iron-containing microglia, revealing a potential new therapeutic avenue to treat chronic brain inflammation in MS and related neurodegenerative diseases.According to the authors, it s possible that targeting C1q in human microglia could halt MS lesions in their tracks.In MS, the immune system attacks myelin, a protective layer that forms around nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to vision loss, muscle weakness, problems with balance and coordination, fatigue, numbness, and other debilitating symptoms. A subset of people develop progressive MS, resulting in extensive brain tissue damage and disability. Anti-inflammatory medications help patients manage their symptoms by dampening the responses of immune cells in the blood and lymph nodes. But treatments are not as effective for patients with chronic lesions who experience ongoing brain tissue inflammation. We have terrific therapies that block new inflammation but nothing to stop the inflammation that s already there,  said Dr. Reich.  In order to make strides in developing new therapies for progressive MS, we re going to need to pick apart the cellular and molecular mechanisms one by one. In 2019, Dr. Reich and his team reported that damaging, chronic active lesions may be a hallmark of progressive MS. The current study identifies microglia and C1q as promising targets for progressive MS and supports the use of chronically inflamed rim lesions as an MRI biomarker for disease progression.There is no cure for MS, and no therapies that directly treat chronic active lesions. By gaining a deeper understanding of lesion features, this study may help pave the way toward early clinical trials to test new therapies for this aspect of the disease.This study was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program at the NINDS.Reference: Absinta M, Maric D, Gharagozloo M, et al.

These samples were then measured at the University of Strathclyde using the novel sensor, which revealed that the presence of bacterial infection could be rapidly detected. In the preliminary work which led to this clinical study the sensors were used to detect Proteus mirabilis, one of the most common bacteria types found in wounds. This organism is commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract and forms part of the body s normal microflora, but can cause disease in those with compromised immune systems or wounds.The peer reviewed study, which won Best Paper Award at the annual World Congress on Electrical Engineering and Computer Systems Science in July, describes the real time electrochemical detection of the pathogen, with the growth detected in laboratory tests one hour after sample inoculation.The electrochemical technique adopted measures the electrical  impedance  of a sample over a wide range of electrical signal frequencies, creating spectra - formed by the measurement of how current flows through the bacterial layer at each frequency. Changes to these spectra over time can be investigated, providing information about the microbiological content of the sample. This and a unique mathematical approach to studying the spectra have resulted in patents being granted for the method.Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are a significant threat to patient welfare, resulting in increased treatment times, costs and illness.  Wound infections are a common form of HAI.A research study commissioned by the Scottish Government published in June which involved Strathclyde suggested one per cent of patients develop hospital associated infections (HAIs), costing NHS Scotland more than  46M annually.The researchers believe the technology has the potential to be incorporated into a cost-effective real time wound monitoring device able to rapidly detect infection, which could greatly reduce wound infection detection and identification times in clinical settings.Aiden Hannah, a biomedical engineering researcher from the University who carried out this work, said:  Whilst a range of other bacteria have been detected using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, to the best of our knowledge this is first reported study of real-time Proteus mirabilis detection using a label-free, screen printed carbon electrode. The ability of our low cost sensors to rapidly detect the presence of infection in clinical wound samples highlights their potential for adoption into point-of-care infection monitoring devices. The ability to monitor infection status in real time, would enable earlier intervention and improved prognosis. Consultant Diabetologist for NHS Ayrshire & Arran, Professor Andrew Collier, who was part of the study with Senior Podiatrist Danielle Main, said:  Diabetes foot ulcers are, unfortunately, common, with the lifetime risk for an ulcer being approximately 15 to 25 per cent.  Infection is common and can lead to lower limb amputation if not treated early and aggressively. Early detection and appropriate treatment of infection will reduce the risk of amputation significantly, with three out of four amputations preventable.   The early detection of infection demonstrated in this study will have significant impact upon both the individual with a diabetes foot ulcer and NHS resources.

But new research published today in Science Advances suggests that there may be an unexpectedly positive impact of high salt intake.Luckily, human data were ready and waiting for the team, released by the lab of Nobel Prize-winning Japanese scientist Tasuku Honjo. Honjo won his award for his work into anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, a cancer immunotherapy regime that targets a protein that can inadvertently stop cancer-killing cells from doing their job.Honjo s lab had investigated why such a significant fraction of those taking checkpoint inhibitor therapies did not respond to them and had identified that a metabolite derived from the microbiome, hippuric acid, predicted a positive response to therapy. We took those data and analyzed our metabolomics data,  says Awasthi.  We found that when you put the mice on a high-salt diet in a tumor condition, you also find hippuric acid is very significantly enriched. Connecting two things, we found that maybe the salt is utilizing the same pathway as those immunotherapy drugs in the human setting.  Hippurate, released by Bifidobacterium, may act as the wake-up call that reactivates suppressed NK cells.Digging down even further, Awasthi s team showed that a high-salt diet was able to reduce the expression of the immunosuppressive PD-1 protein, the same target of Honjo s immunotherapy. Based on this observation, the team tried a new approach, dosing mice on a lower-salt diet (that could still slightly raise the level of salt in the mice s bodies) with a suboptimal dose of Honjo s immunotherapy. Here, this lower level of salt acted as a booster for the immunotherapy regime, significantly reducing tumor size. This, Awasthi points out, could lead to a regimen that reduces the effective dose of the immensely expensive immunotherapy, making it more accessible in developing countries.Could these effects be a result of some intrinsic action of salt on NK cells? One experiment the team conducted suggests this is unlikely. In mice that had their microbiome depleted using antibiotics, the effects of a high-salt diet disappeared   suggesting that these bacteria are essential to the underlying mechanism. This raises the possibility of an approach that bypasses dietary salt altogether. The team outlined this in experiments where, instead of altering salt intake, microbiome-deleted mice were given fecal transplants from other mice fed on high-salt diets. This restored the recipients  cancer-fighting ability.The team now hope that a salt-and-immunotherapy regime could be brought to clinical trials, targeting patients for whom conventional therapy options have run out. Awasthi admits that patients  salt levels would have to be closely monitored in any such trial, but the study points the way to a new treatment option for cancer that is both effectively and startlingly novel.

To assess the impact of legal cannabis smoking, the researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed the local laws of 274 jurisdictions across 11 US states and that had legalized marijuana between November 2012 and July of 2020. Among these jurisdictions, just 56 localities in 5 states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan) permitted cannabis consumption within a cannabis business. Of these 56 regions, 5 (9 percent) require that indoor area to be smoke-free. Thirteen of the regions (23 percent) permit smoking in isolated rooms with certain caveats, such that smoke not drift to non-smoking areas or that there be a smoke-free employee viewing area. This approach, according to the researchers, can control cannabis smoke exposure if executed properly, but  doesn t protect employees and patrons  from second-hand cannabis smoke exposure in smoking areas. The remaining localities (68 percent), according to the researchers, don t protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke because they don t require physical separation of smoking and non-smoking areas. These laws, the researchers claim, resemble the tobacco industry s framework by inviting smoke inside and positioning ventilation or engineering controls as second-hand smoke solutions.  After decades of progress in clearing the indoor air of tobacco smoke, we are seeing it replaced with cannabis smoke using the same discredited arguments the tobacco industry used in its unsuccessful fight against tobacco smoke restrictions,  Stanton A. Glantz, a retired professor from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education and co-author of the paper, said in a statement.  We need to learn from the past and keep the air clean for all,  he added. In the study s conclusion, Glantz and the other authors recommend that policymakers be made aware that ventilation and other engineering interventions are inadequate solutions to the health concerns posed by second-hand smoke from products like pre rolls, which are often wrapped in pre roll packaging. Instead, law makers should strive for the same health and safety standards currently in place to protect the public from tobacco smoke.  While many states maintain strong tobacco smoking and vaping bans to protect public health, our research reveals that some state and local laws exempt cannabis smoke from clean air laws and open the door to smoke-filled businesses, defeating decades of public health advances,  Thomas L. Rotering, a researcher at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education and co-author of the study, said in a statement. Cannabis smoke is known to contain many of the same chemicals present in tobacco smoke. Yet the effects of these chemicals may be altered when present with cannabinoids, according to some research. One scientific review published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention in 2015 found no association between cannabis use and lung cancer despite marijuana smoke containing many known carcinogens in amounts comparable with those found in tobacco smoke. One explanation for this null association, as posited by the review, is that cannabinoids like THC counteract the carcinogens with their tumor-suppressant effects, which have been evidenced in several cell culture and animal models studies. But other, more recent studies have documented the negative health risks second-hand cannabis smoke can pose. A study published in Pediatric Research this year found that the children of regular cannabis consumers who smoke or vape come down with viral respiratory infections more often than children whose parents don t smoke. However, other risks known to be associated with second-hand tobacco smoke, such as ear infections or asthma attacks, weren t reported more frequently in the children of frequent cannabis users. Another paper published in EClinicalMedicine earlier this year found that cannabis smoking raises the levels of the toxic chemicals acrylonitrile and acrylamide in the blood, but not to the same extremes seen in tobacco smokers.","Published: September 10, 2021"

An MDC team led by Annette Hammes has discovered candidate genes that can positively influence the severity of this congenital malformation of the forebrain, as the researchers now report in the journal Development.Holoprosencephaly (HPE) affects around one to four in every 1,000 unborns, and occurs when the cerebral hemispheres of the forebrain fail to divide or only partially divide. It is the most common malformation of the forebrain in humans and is associated with facial disfigurements, such as cleft lip and cleft palate or eyes that are very close together   even to the extent that the two eyeballs merge. The majority of fetuses affected die while still in the womb.The exact causes of HPE are not yet fully understood. In addition to environmental pollutants and illness of the expectant mother, genetic factors can play a role   including mutations in the genes of the so-called Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. This pathway controls the embryonic development of organs and the nervous system. Gene defects and a resulting loss of function of LRP2, an SHH co-receptor, result in brain defects that manifest themselves very differently.  We wanted to know why the severity of this disease varies so much,  says Dr. Annette Hammes, head of the Molecular Pathways in Cortical Development Lab at the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC).  While some sufferers have no or only mild symptoms, others have to live with severe deformities   even if the two patients are related to each other and we can therefore assume that the disease is caused by the same gene mutation.

You recovered, but years later you begin having difficulty sleeping. You also become very sensitive to noise and bright lights, and find it hard to carry out your daily activities, or perform well at your job.This is a common situation after a traumatic brain injury many people experience bad side effects months or years later. These long-term effects can last a few days or the rest of a person s life. No therapies currently exist to prevent the disabilities that can develop after a brain trauma,  says Jeanne Paz, PhD, associate investigator at Gladstone Institutes.  So, understanding how the traumatic brain injury affects the brain, especially in the long term, is a really important gap in research that could help develop new and better treatment options. In a new study published in the journal Science, Paz and her team helped close that gap. They identified a specific molecule in a part of the brain called the thalamus that plays a key role in secondary effects of brain injury, such as sleep disruption, epileptic activity, and inflammation. In collaboration with scientists at Annexon Biosciences, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, they also showed that an antibody treatment could prevent the development of these negative outcomes.

The study, involving a team of scientists from the University of Leeds and the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, involved the microscopic nematode species, Caenorhabditis elegans.   In a paper published today in the journal Communications Biology, the researchers show that sensory cells in this animal are not only picking up signals from the environment, they are also processing that information to drive decision making that dictates the animal s motion.   Up to now, scientists had generally believed information from sensory cells was sent to other circuits in the animal s brain for decision making and to control behaviour.   Professor Netta Cohen, Computational Neuroscientist at the University of Leeds and co-lead author in the paper, said:  Our findings are startling   we found simple mechanisms by which salt tasting cells drive a rather sophisticated strategy to forage for food.

Drugs only rarely alleviate this type of anemia. Researchers at the University of Basel have now been able to show what causes the anemia, and that physical exercise can improve this condition.The two major symptoms of cancer are loss of muscle mass and a reduced hemoglobin level, leading to weight loss, fatigue, lethargy and reduced physical performance. Moreover, both symptoms   atrophy and anemia   prompt many patients to schedule a doctor s appointment, then resulting in the diagnosis of a tumor. Why cancer causes muscle atrophy and anemia is not yet understood, and treatment is currently difficult.The fact that anemia leads to a decline of the overall state of health and can negatively affect the course of cancer therapy highlights the urgency to obtain insights into causes and potential remedies. In collaboration with the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel, the research group of Professor Christoph Handschin at the Biozentrum has now been able to show in a mouse model that cancer not only triggers a systemic inflammatory reaction, but also massively changes the handling of lipids and other metabolites in the body.

In the United States, 12% of the population is Black and 18% is Hispanic or Latino. But among the 32,000 patients who participated in the clinical trials that led to the FDA approval of new drugs in 2020, only 8% were Black and 11% were Hispanic, according to the agency(link is external and opens in a new window).  People of different ethnicities can have different responses to the same medicine or treatment, so a lack of diversity among clinical trial participants means doctors cannot know if the treatment will be effective in all the patients they treat,  said Anil K. Rustgi, MD, Interim Executive Vice President and Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine at Columbia University and director of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Increasing diversity in trials will improve the treatment of patients from underrepresented groups and is a moral imperative as well as a fundamental medical issue. Rod MacKenzie, PhD, Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Pfizer, said,  Diversity of representation in clinical trials is a matter of equity, which is a core Pfizer value. We are deeply committed to ensuring our clinical trials reflect the diversity of the communities like New York in which they are conducted. We look forward to working with Columbia University both to offer any willing individual, regardless of background, the opportunity to participate in and contribute to clinical research, and to expand the roster of diverse clinical researchers who are helping us conduct studies. The Columbia-Pfizer Clinical Trials Diversity Initiative will work to improve the diversity of participants in clinical trials by examining the barriers that prevent participation by individuals from underserved groups. The initiative will expand Columbia s Community Health Workers Program network to connect with underserved populations and create culturally sensitive engagement tools. The effort also will include identifying new ways to make clinical trials more accessible through telemedicine, wearable technology, and home visits.The Initiative also aims to improve diversity among clinical research faculty and staff. Columbia will help build an additional pipeline of diverse clinical investigators through a new National Diversity Clinical Trials Leadership Program to increase the number of faculty and staff from underrepresented groups as well. A diverse research staff not only helps to improve trust in clinical trials among participants from underserved groups but improves the entire clinical trial enterprise by bringing different questions, experience, and perspective to the table,  Rustgi said.This article has been republished from the following materials.

When a type of fat called LDL cholesterol becomes oxidised and builds up to form plaques in the artery walls, inflammation and damage increase which can cause the plaques to rupture and cause blood to clot.These clots can block vital arteries that allow blood to flow to the heart, causing a heart attack, or to the brain causing a stroke.Previously, researchers at the University of Reading discovered that LDL cholesterol can be oxidised in acidic small  bags  called lysosomes in immune cells within the artery wall.Now, Professor David Leake and his team have found that the antioxidant drug, cysteamine, has the power to switch off, and even reverse, this damaging process.Cysteamine works by accumulating in the lysosomes and stops the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. It is already known to be safe in humans where it s used to treat a rare lysosomal disease called cystinosis.When the researchers looked at mice with atherosclerosis, those treated with cysteamine had a 32 to 56 per cent reduction in the size of atherosclerotic plaques depending on the part of the aorta   the largest artery in the body   that was examined.Cysteamine decreased the amount of oxidised fat by 73 per cent and increased the stability of the atherosclerotic areas. It decreased the proportion of inflammatory white blood cells by 55 per cent and increased the area made up of smooth muscle cells by 85 per cent, ultimately reducing the chance of plaques rupturing and causing a blood clot.Antioxidant drugs that have previously produced promising results in mice have proven disappointing in clinical trials to treat cardiovascular disease, but the researchers hope that with these promising results, cysteamine will prove a successful treatment in humans.Professor David Leake, Professor of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Reading who led the study said: The potential in this drug to protect against heart attacks and strokes and ultimately save lives superseded our expectations. We hoped it would cause plaques to grow at a slower pace, but we were amazed to find it reversed the process. Cysteamine would offer an entirely new way of treating atherosclerosis. We now want to look at the most efficient way to give this drug to patients, and hope that it can be taken to clinical trials in the next few years. Professor James Leiper, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research said: Heart attacks and strokes threaten the lives of people too often. In the UK, every 5 minutes someone is admitted to hospital with a heart attack, and the same is true of stroke.  The more ways we can find to treat the root cause of cardiovascular disease, the more lives and livelihoods that can be saved. If this antioxidant drug can show the same promising effects in humans, then it could offer a lifeline to thousands of people in the future. Reference: Ahmad F, Mitchell RD, Houben T, et al.

The cells of all living organisms hold a collection of mini biological machines called organelles. These structures run the cell s powerhouse mitochondria, brainy nucleus and other operations, all with a defined border and encased in a membrane. However, there are other cell parts that appear as viscous, membrane-free  blobs,  but they serve distinct purposes, such as regulating genes, sending chemical signals or storage sites for specialized molecules. Scientists have long thought these somewhat mystifying droplets might be a primordial version of organelles, and the Johns Hopkins-led research team worked with laboratory worms to study them further. A report on the research team s findings about these droplets, which are called biomolecular condensates, appears Sept. 10 in Science.  I hope this work will help convince scientists that biomolecular condensates are highly sophisticated cellular compartments,  says Geraldine Seydoux, Ph.D., the Huntington Sheldon Professor in Medical Discovery and vice dean for basic research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  We found they have regulated roles and respond to the environment, just like other organelles. And we found that they do have membranes, just not the type we re used to seeing.  Biomolecular condensates were first dubbed  granules  in the 1970s by scientists who used electron microscopy to peer more closely at the structures in many organisms, including squiggly creatures called C. elegans, whose relatively simple biology has made them a common laboratory model for studying everything from modern gene-cutting technology to protein structure. The condensates in worms, which look tough and similar in appearance to grains of sand, are known as P granules. In 2014 in Seydoux s lab, graduate student Jennifer Wang conducted genetic analyses to find a protein called MEG-3 in worm P granules. Wang s experiments showed that another protein, PGL-3, creates the viscous liquid droplets, the  core  of P granules, and that MEG-3 loiters on the outside of the P granule, making small  clusters  that coat the surface of the P granules.  What we didn t understand was these proteins could just linger on the outside of P granules yet be so integral to stabilizing the interior of the granules,  says Seydoux. The mystery was still unsolved when, in January, 2020, Seydoux was looking for the right words to describe their observations. She Googled  solids stabilizing liquids  and found references to the food science concept of Pickering emulsions.  I had an OMG moment when I read more about this phenomenon,  says Seydoux. An emulsion is a mixture of two liquids that don t normally mix well, like oil and water. A Pickering emulsion is such a mixture that is stabilized, like the everyday carton of milk from the grocery store. Unprocessed cow milk is naturally unstable, and the fat droplets in milk tend to glom together to reduce the overall surface area among the fat molecules. The fat molecules   or cream   rise to the top and separate from the whey, or watery liquid in the milk. To avoid milk separation and stabilize the liquid, dairy processors push milk through a small needle, which breaks up the fat droplets, coats them with a protein called casein and avoids creating a creamy layer of fused fat molecules. Seydoux says it occurred to her that MEG-3 might act in a way very similar to casein s effect in milk, lowering the surface tension of the droplets to keep them from fusing together. And MEG-3 s tendency to remain around the surface of P granules suggested to her that it acted as a kind of membrane, she adds. In their experiments, Seydoux and her team showed that PGL-3 droplets coated with MEG-3 stay evenly separated on glass slides, with twice as many droplets compared with uncoated condensates that fuse together, forming fewer and larger droplets on the glass slide.  This is a well-known phenomenon in food science, and now we see that it may also be happening inside a cell,  says Seydoux. Seydoux and her team also engineered worm egg cells that lacked MEG-3 and saw that the uncoated P granules dissolved more slowly. This and other experiments, says Seydoux, suggest that MEG-3 not only stabilizes the droplets under normal conditions but also allows the droplets to respond more quickly when environmental conditions change. Seydoux s team of postdoctoral students, including cell imaging specialist Andrew Folkmann and biochemist Andrea Putnam, sought help to complete their studies from an expert in physical chemistry who could guide them through the physics of Pickering emulsions. Several months after adding bioengineer Chiu Fan Lee from the Imperial College of London to the team, he helped them identify a missing component in their MEG-3 worm model: an enzyme called MBK-2 that helps the liquid inside P granules become less viscous.  Together, these experiments provide an explanation for how this primordial soup inside cells can assemble into compartments that resist fusing together and that respond to developmental cues,  says Seydoux. The team plans further studies to determine the precise physical structure of MEG-3 and additional details about how it works. If further studies pan out, MEG-3 could provide a renewable resource for developing Pickering emulsions in the food and chemical industry, they say. Seydoux and the team have filed patents on the use of MEG-3 as a tool for developing Pickering emulsions.ReferenceFolkmann AW et al.

Chan School of Public Health.The one-year study, which included participants in offices across six countries working in a variety of fields, including engineering, real estate investment, architecture, and technology, found that increased concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and lower ventilation rates (measured using carbon dioxide (CO2) levels as a proxy) were associated with slower response times and reduced accuracy on a series of cognitive tests. The researchers noted that they observed impaired cognitive function at concentrations of PM2.5 and CO2 that are common within indoor environments.  Our study adds to the emerging evidence that air pollution has an impact on our brain. The findings show that increases in PM2.5 levels were associated with acute reductions in cognitive function. It s the first time we ve seen these short-term effects among younger adults,  said Jose Guillermo Cede o Laurent, a research fellow in the Department of Environmental Health and lead author of the study.  The study also confirmed how low ventilation rates negatively impact cognitive function. Overall, the study suggests that poor indoor air quality affects health and productivity significantly more than we previously understood.  The study was published online in Environmental Research Letters on September 9, 2021. A growing body of research has shown that indoor and outdoor air pollution diminishes cognitive function. While it is well known that air pollutants such as PM2.5 can penetrate indoor environments, few studies have focused on how indoor exposures to PM2.5 and outdoor air ventilation rates affect cognition. Cede o-Laurent noted that this is a particularly important area of research given the high percentage of time people spend indoors, especially office workers. To better understand the issue, the research team enrolled more than 300 office workers in cities across China, India, Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 65, worked at least three days a week in an office building, and had a permanent workstation within the office. Each participant s workspace was outfitted with an environmental sensor that monitored in real-time concentrations of PM2.5 and CO2, as well as temperature and relative humidity. Additionally, each participant had a custom-designed app on their phones through which cognitive tests and surveys could be administered. Study participants were prompted to participate in tests and surveys at prescheduled times or when the environmental sensors detected levels of PM2.5 and CO2 that fell below or exceeded certain thresholds. Two types of tests were administered: One test required employees to correctly identify the color of displayed words and was used to evaluate cognitive speed and inhibitory control the ability to focus on relevant stimuli when irrelevant stimuli are also present. The second test consisted of basic arithmetic questions and was used to assess cognitive speed and working memory. The study found that response times on the color-based test were slower as PM2.5 and CO2 levels increased. They also found that accuracy on the color-based test was affected by PM2.5 and CO2 levels. For the arithmetic-based test, the study found that increases in CO2 but not PM2.5 were associated with slower response times. As concentrations of both pollutants increased, however, participants completed fewer questions correctly in the allotted test time.  The world is rightly focused on COVID-19, and strategies like better ventilation and filtration are key to slowing infectious disease transmission indoors,  said Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment of science and senior author on the study.  Our research consistently finds that the value proposition of these strategies extends to cognitive function and productivity of workers, making healthy buildings foundational to public health and business strategy moving forward.

For hundreds of thousands of African families living in the  shea belt  it is also a crucial source of nutrition and income. Despite its increasing demand, the slow-growing shea tree is being threatened by other cash crops and its preservation most likely lies in its genetic improvement. To enable such work, an international team of researchers led by the University of New Hampshire has sequenced the shea tree s genome, providing a valuable resource for the strategic development of the species. A shea tree can take 25 years or more to come into production so it can be very costly for a farmer to wait that long and wonder if a tree is worth keeping,  said Iago Hale, associate professor of specialty crop improvement.  With such a long growing period, traditional breeding strategies simply aren t viable, which is one reason there aren t any high-performing shea varieties. The shea genome will enable researchers to gauge the potential of a seedling as soon as it germinates and through genome-enabled tree selection, we can start moving the needle on this difficult species. In their study, published online in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, researchers assembled a chromosome-scale reference genome for the shea tree. Like the human genome, the shea tree genome contains genes that determine traits helping researchers to determine tree characteristics. Genome annotation by the researchers led to the identification of 38,505 coding genes. Further comparative sequencing with a diverse collection of trees revealed nearly 3.5 million natural genetic variations, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that can be used to distinguish trees and begin to understand the genetics underlying important attributes.Shea butter plays a significant role in the daily lives of millions of African families living in the Sudo-Sahelian region which spans over 20 countries. Collecting shea nuts is nearly a universal household activity across the shea belt and, unlike other economic activities, is controlled almost entirely by women. According to daily shea butter consumption data, the number of women taking part in shea nut collection is estimated at more than 18 million. Shea is referred to as ""women s gold"" because the sale of its products allows women to secure additional food for their families once cereal harvests are over and to generate cash for household expenses including clothing, medicine and school fees. The seasonality of shea availability is also critical since shea fruits are the only widely available, energy-rich food source at the end of the dry season. The shea parklands are in decline due to the threat of alternative, typically male-controlled cash crops like cashew and mango and the immediate pay-off of cutting questionably productive trees for firewood,  said Hale.  Women need to travel longer distances to collect shea nuts, which means more labor and less profits. To counteract these trends, we need to enhance the value of shea in the landscape. Genome-assisted breeding presents a path for achieving that. Internationally, shea butter is valuable for its use as a high-quality cocoa butter equivalent (CBE) in the chocolate industry. This is linked to its relatively simple fatty acid composition and its high levels of stearin, the primary determinant of shea butter quality. Using the newly mapped genome, researchers identified forty-five fatty acid biosynthesis genes in shea that likely govern stearin content. Being able to identify these enzymes could help researchers develop better selection strategies for seedlings.Reference: Hale I, Ma X, Melo ATO, et al.

The finding, published in Circulation Research, could lead to new treatments for preeclampsia other than premature delivery, which is often the only option. Preeclampsia is a regrettably common cause of premature birth, which can be life-threatening for babies and lead to lifelong consequences. Through identifying PP2A s role in this condition, we may be able to develop treatments for preeclampsia that are far better for both mothers and babies,  said study leader Philip W. Shaul, M.D., Professor and Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Pediatrics at UTSW and Director of the Center for Pulmonary and Vascular Biology. Dr. Shaul co-led this study with Chieko Mineo, Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Cell Biology.Preeclampsia, which affects 5 to 7% of pregnant women worldwide, can be deadly for gestating mothers and their babies and requires delivery at a premature stage.  Although the causes of preeclampsia aren t well understood, explained Dr. Shaul, researchers have linked the condition to a variety of risk factors. One is an autoimmune disease known as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), in which antibodies react to proteins on the surface of some cells. Although APS is relatively rare, affecting only about 5 in every 100,000 people, studies have identified APS antibodies in about 29% of pregnant women with preeclampsia.To better understand how APS leads to preeclampsia, Dr. Shaul, Dr. Mineo, and their colleagues created an animal model by injecting pregnant mice with APS antibodies. These animals developed high blood pressure and a rise in urine protein, which are characteristics of preeclampsia.  In contrast, the APS antibodies didn t affect blood pressure in nonpregnant mice.Based on previous work, the researchers knew that a protein called ApoER2 may be related to the harmful actions of APS antibodies on placental cells called trophoblasts. These cells, which normally journey from the fetal side of the placenta to the maternal side to provide the fetus with nutrients, don t successfully make that connection in preeclampsia. In mice, the APS antibodies prevented trophoblast migration, and growth of the fetus was restricted. When the researchers genetically engineered mice without ApoER2 in trophoblasts, the fetuses developed normally despite APS antibody treatment,  and the mothers were protected from developing preeclampsia.But the scientists knew that ApoER2 didn t tell the whole story. They found that in the presence of the APS antibodies, ApoER2 triggers the activity of PP2A, an enzyme that regulates protein functions throughout the body. Further experiments showed that in the pregnant mice with APS antibodies, heightened activity in PP2A increased trophoblast production of proteins known to be involved in preeclampsia.When the researchers gave the pregnant mice a drug that inhibits PP2A, they were protected from preeclampsia, and the treatment had no apparent harmful effects on the mice or their gestating babies.Hoping to translate these findings to human patients, the scientists examined placentas from women with APS, finding that they too had increased activity of PP2A. However, in a surprising turn, they discovered that compared with placentas from normal pregnancies, those from preeclamptic patients without APS also had increased PP2A activity, suggesting that this mechanism could be operating in a variety of forms of preeclampsia. With further research, Dr. Shaul said, treatments targeting PP2A or its related machinery in the trophoblast may eventually be viable treatments for preeclampsia in pregnant women.Reference: Chu H, Sacharidou A, Nguyen A, et al.

However, new evidence by an international team led by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine shows that some allergic reactions provide necessary protection against highly invasive and potentially lethal infectious agents, such as yeast.Working with an animal model of yeast-triggered asthma commonly observed in people, the researchers uncovered a molecular mechanism by which yeast activates platelets to mediate an allergic immune response that clears yeast from the lungs. In the absence of platelets, yeast can invade and lead to a quick, deadly outcome. Reported in the journal Immunity, this work is one of the first to show a clear molecular pathway supporting the role of platelets in the immune response.  A common yeast called Candida albicans is a well-known cause of human allergic airway diseases, such as asthma,  said corresponding author Dr. David B. Corry, professor of medicine-immunology, allergy and rheumatology and Fulbright Endowed Chair in Pathology at Baylor.  However, the mechanisms by which yeast triggers asthmatic reactions are poorly understood.  In addition to yeast, mold also is an important cause of human allergies. Corry and his colleagues had previously shown that mold triggers an allergic immune response by producing a type of enzymes called proteases. The enzymes activate T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) immune cells, which mediate the allergic response. Mold and yeast are two kinds of fungi.  Candida also makes proteases, so we hypothesized that its proteases, like those of mold, also would be involved in promoting an allergic immune response,  said Corry, a member of Baylor s Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center.  We actually found something completely different. Working with a mouse model of yeast-triggered asthma, we discovered that Candida proteases do not drive Th2 and Th17-mediated allergic immune responses. Instead, Candida promotes these types of immune responses by producing the peptide candidalysin,  said co-first author Dr. Yifan Wu, postdoctoral associate in the Corry lab. Peptides, like proteins, are made of amino acids linked together like beads on a necklace, but include fewer amino acids than proteins. Candidalysin was originally described as a peptide toxin unique to Candida, capable of lysing or disintegrating cells. In this study, Corry, Wu and their colleagues found that candidalysin also can trigger an allergic immune response and the mechanism that mediates it. The researchers discovered that candidalysin binds to the receptor GP1b-alpha, a molecule on the surface of platelets. This binding prompted the platelets to release a protein called Dkk-1, which in turn drove Th2 and Th17 allergic responses that correlate with reduced lung yeast burdens in experimental animal models.  Our results show that when the animal models produce an asthmatic response, they clear away Candida in the lungs very efficiently,  Wu said.  On the other hand, in the absence of platelets, there is no allergy response and Candida spreads unchecked, leading to a quick death. Platelets are well-known for their role mediating blood clotting to stop or prevent bleeding. In this study, Corry, Wu and their colleagues are the first to provide molecular evidence for another role of platelets as active contributors to the immune response. When Candida enters the airway, the authors explain, platelets respond in two ways to combat the infection. On one side there is a Candida infection that very rapidly becomes invasive as the yeast burrows through lung tissue, rupturing and entering blood vessels from where it can migrate to other places in the body. In response to this invasion, the platelets activate their blood clotting function to reduce Candida s advances.  Independently from their clotting function, we found that platelets respond to candidalysin by promoting the development Th2 and Th17-mediated allergic immune responses that confer immunological protection against Candida s invasion,  Wu said.  This molecular pathway supports the role of platelets in the immune response.""  We are most excited about crystalizing the notion that platelets are essential immune cells and the possibility of their roles in other conditions,  Corry said.ReferenceWu Y et al.

They found that a tool commonly used in research for evaluating a person s genetic risk for a disease, called a polygenic risk score, was no better at predicting the outcome of a patient s disease over time than written reports. The results raise important questions about the use of polygenic risk scores in real-world, clinical situations, and also suggest that a doctor s written report may be an untapped source of predictive information. Treating schizophrenia patients is a heart-wrenching experience. One of the hardest parts about taking care of patients is trying to determine whether each patient s condition will worsen or improve. If we could do that, then we might help relieve the suffering that the patients and their loved ones experience,  said Alexander W. Charney, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Genetics and Genomic Sciences at Icahn Mount Sinai and the senior author of the study published in Nature Medicine.  Our results show that for the mental illnesses most deeply characterized at the genetic level, the current state of genetics research cannot solve this problem just yet. Affecting about 20 million people worldwide, schizophrenia is a life-shortening mental disorder that alters the way a person thinks, acts, and perceives reality. Typically, symptoms appear in the late teens to early thirties and can last a lifetime. While some patients may respond well to treatment, others do not at all.Although it is a highly inherited disease, the majority of cases cannot be linked to a single gene. Instead, scientists have found that the risk of suffering from schizophrenia is influenced by a complex combination of normal genetic variants, none of which on their own contribute a great amount to risk but together account for many cases. Currently, nearly 300 such variants have been associated with schizophrenia.The polygenic risk score is a commonly used method for summarizing the genetic component of a person s risk for a disease. Over the past decade, many large studies have shown that the risk scores of schizophrenia patients are significantly higher than that of healthy controls. Similar results have been seen in studies on other disorders such as hypertension and diabetes. The polygenic risk score basically adds up all of the traits that are associated with a complex disorder. Initially it was designed to be descriptive tool. More recently, scientists have proposed that it could be an effective tool for precision medicine wherein a person s genetics is used to diagnose disease and predict outcomes,  said Isotta Landi, PhD, a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Charney s lab and the lead author of the study.  In this study we wanted to rigorously test out whether the polygenic risk score could also be a predictive tool. At first, the researchers compared the genetic and medical records of 762 schizophrenia patients stored in the Mount Sinai Health System s BioMe  BioBank program. Specifically, they tested whether a patient s polygenic risk score for schizophrenia could predict six poor outcomes of each patient any better than the information derived from the medical reports written by doctors.To do this, Dr. Landi worked with others to develop advanced computer programs that calculate polygenic risk scores from a patient s genetic data and use natural language processing tools to extract information from written reports.They found that two of the outcomes aggressive behavior and the need for hospitalization were significantly associated with higher polygenic risk scores. However, the scores were no more effective at predicting these outcomes than was the information derived from the written reports, and combining the two did not change predictability.Follow-up experiments supported these results. For instance, the researchers saw no change in the results when they tried to predict outcomes only in people with the highest polygenic risk scores.Finally, they saw the same trend when they analyzed genetic and medical records of 7,779 patients stored in the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort, a large National Institutes of Health-funded project. Once again, the polygenic risk scores did not improve upon the ability of clinical data to predict poor outcomes. Our results suggest that more work needs to be done to harness the potential that genetics has to improve the treatment of schizophrenia patients,  Dr. Charney said.  The results also suggest that the detailed medical reports that doctors write may contain much more valuable and predictive information than we originally anticipated.""Reference: Landi I, Kaji DA, Cotter L, et al.

We showed for the first time a reduced risk for ischemic stroke incidence associated with higher peanut consumption in an Asian population,  said lead study author Satoyo Ikehara, Ph.D., specially appointed associate professor of public health in the department of social medicine at the Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine in Suita, Japan.  Our results suggest that adding peanuts to your diet has a beneficial effect on the prevention of ischemic stroke.  Peanuts are rich in heart-healthy nutrients, such as  monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins and dietary fiber that help lower risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing risk factors, including high blood pressure, high blood levels of  bad  cholesterol and chronic inflammation,  Ikehara said. Researchers examined the frequency of how often people reported eating peanuts in relation to stroke occurrence and cardiovascular disease. The analysis includes people who were recruited in two phases, in 1995 and 1998-1999, for a total of more than 74,000 Asian men and women, ages 45 to 74, from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants completed a comprehensive lifestyle survey, which included a questionnaire about the frequency of peanut consumption. They were followed for approximately 15 years   through 2009 or 2012, depending on when they were originally enrolled. The incidence of stroke and ischemic heart disease were determined by linking with 78 participating hospitals in the areas included in the study. Researchers adjusted for other health conditions, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption and physical activity, as detailed by participants in the questionnaires. According to medical records, researchers noted 3,599 strokes (2,223 ischemic and 1,376 hemorrhagic) and 849 cases of ischemic heart disease developed during the follow-up period. The levels of peanut consumption were ranked in four quartiles, with 0 peanuts a day as the least intake compared to 4.3 unshelled peanuts a day (median) as the highest. Compared to a peanut-free diet, researchers found eating about 4-5 unshelled peanuts per day was associated with: - 20% lower risk of ischemic stroke; - 16% lower risk of total stroke; and - 13% lower risk of having cardiovascular disease (this included both stroke and ischemic heart disease). - A significant association was not found between peanut consumption and a lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke or ischemic heart disease. The link between peanut consumption and lowered risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease was consistent in both men and women.  The beneficial effect of peanut consumption on risk of stroke, especially ischemic stroke was found, despite the small quantity of peanuts eaten by study participants,  Ikehara said.  The habit of eating peanuts and tree nuts is still not common in Asian countries. However, adding even a small amount to one s diet could be a simple yet effective approach to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.  The American Heart Association recommends eating about five servings of unsalted nuts per week; one serving is   ounce (2 tablespoons) of nuts. Besides peanuts, the Association also says other healthy nut options include unsalted cashews, walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts and hazelnuts. Several limitations were noted in the study, including the validity and reliability of peanut consumption measurements in the data collection and analysis. Bias caused by these measurements may lead to errors in the association. However, a measurement error correction analysis was performed, and the associations proved to be accurate.ReferenceIkehara S et al.

Similar to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) the images reveal in unprecedented detail huge seafloor channels - each one 10 times wider than the River Thames.For the first time an international team of scientists can show previously undetectable landscapes that formed beneath the vast ice sheets that covered much of the UK and Western Europe thousands to millions of years ago. These ancient structures provide clues to how ice sheets react to a warming climate. The findings are published this week (9 September) in the journal Geology. So called tunnel valleys, buried hundreds of metres beneath the seafloor in the North Sea are remnants of huge rivers that were the  plumbing system  of the ancient ice sheets as they melted in response to rising air temperatures. Lead author James Kirkham, from British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the University of Cambridge, says:  The origin of these channels was unresolved for over a century.  This discovery will help us better understand the ongoing retreat of present-day glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland.  In the way that we can leave footprints in the sand, glaciers leave an imprint on the land upon which they flow. Our new cutting edge data gives us important markers of deglaciation.   Dr Kelly Hogan, co-author and a geophysicist at BAS, says:  Although we have known about the huge glacial channels in the North Sea for some time, this is the first time we have imaged fine-scale landforms within them. These delicate features tell us about how water moved through the channels (beneath the ice) and even how ice simply stagnated and melted away. It is very difficult to observe what goes on underneath our large ice sheets today, particularly how moving water and sediment is affecting ice flow and we know that these are important controls on ice behaviour. As a result, using these ancient channels to understand how ice will respond to changing conditions in a warming climate is extremely relevant and timely.  3D seismic reflection technology, which was provided by industry partners, uses sound waves to generate detailed three-dimensional representations of ancient landscapes buried deep beneath the surface of the Earth, in a similar manner to how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can image structures within the human body. The method can image features as small as a few metres beneath the surface of the Earth, even if they are buried under hundreds of metres of sediment. The exceptional detail provided by this new data reveals the imprint of how the ice interacted with the channels as they formed. By comparing these ancient  ice fingerprints  to those left beneath modern glaciers, the scientists were able to reconstruct how these ancient ice sheets behaved as they receded. By diving into the past, this work provides a window into a future warmer world where new processes may begin to alter the plumbing system and flow behaviour of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.ReferenceHogan KA et al.

Information moves from the eyes through many connections in the brain. Ideally the same image would be reliably represented the same way each time, but instead different groups of cells in the visual cortex can become stimulated by the same scenes. So how does the brain ultimately ensure fidelity in processing what we see? A team of neuroscientists in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT found out by watching the brains of mice while they watched movies.What the researchers discovered is that while groups of  excitatory  neurons respond when images appear, thereby representing them in the visual cortex, activity among two types of  inhibitory  neurons combines in a neatly arranged circuit behind the scenes to enforce the needed reliability. The researchers were not only able to see and analyze the patterns of these neurons working, but also once they learned how the circuit operated, they took control of the inhibitory cells to directly manipulate how consistently excitatory cells represented images. The question of reliability is hugely important for information processing and particularly for representation - in making vision valid and reliable,  said Mriganka Sur, Newton Professor of Neuroscience in MIT s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and senior author of the new study in the Journal of Neuroscience.  The same neurons should be firing in the same way when I look at something, so that the next time and every time I look at it, it s represented consistently. Research scientist Murat Yildirim and former graduate student Rajeev Rikhye led the study, which required a number of technical feats. To watch hundreds of excitatory neurons and two different inhibitory neurons at work, for instance, they needed to engineer them to flash in distinct colors under different colors of laser light in their two-photon microscope. Taking control of the cells using a technology called  optogenetics  required adding even more genetic manipulations and laser colors. Moreover, to make sense of the cellular activity they were observing, the researchers created a computer model of the tripartite circuit. It was exciting to be able to combine all these experimental elements, including multiple different laser colors, to be able to answer this question,  Yildirim said.

Published in Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology, a new study now investigates whether physiological recovery during sleep relates to eating behaviour and diet quality.The study population consisted of 252 psychologically distressed adults with overweight, who participated in a lifestyle intervention study in three Finnish cities. Their recovery was measured on the basis of sleep-time heart rate variability recorded on three consecutive nights. Heart rate variability was used to measure both parasympathetic and sympathetic activation of the autonomic nervous system, and their relation, i.e., the balance between stress and recovery. The parasympathetic nervous system plays a key role in recovery, during which heart rate is decreased and heart rate variability is high.The study participants  eating behaviour was measured using four different questionnaires, and their diet quality and alcohol consumption was quantified using two different questionnaires and a 48-hour dietary recall. The aim was to explore the association between physiological recovery, diet quality, alcohol consumption and different aspects of eating behaviour, such as eating according to hunger and satiety cues. The present results are from the data collected at baseline before the lifestyle intervention.According to the study, higher sleep-time parasympathetic activity, which is indicative of better physiological recovery, associates with more health-promoting diet quality and lower alcohol consumption, and possibly also with eating habits, especially factors affecting our decision to eat. Especially participants with a good stress balance reported better overall diet quality, higher fibre intake, stronger dietary self-control and lower alcohol consumption than those with a poorer stress balance.However, the researchers point out that the cross-sectional study design allows no causality conclusions. In other words, it cannot be concluded from the results if better recovery leads to a healthier diet or if a healthy diet supports better recovery.Reference: J rvel -Reijonen E, J rvinen S, Karhunen L, et al.

When energy is used to move these molecules from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration, the process is called active transport. Active transport allows cells to take in necessary molecules like glucose or amino acids, store energy, and extract waste.For decades, researchers have been working to create artificial cells engineered microscopic structures that emulate the features and behavior of biological cells. But these cell mimics tend to lack the ability to perform complex cellular processes like active transport.In the Nature study, researchers at New York University and the University of Chicago describe a new, fully synthetic cell mimic that is one step closer to replicating the function of living cells. When deployed in mixtures of different particles, the cell mimics can perform active transport tasks by autonomously capturing, concentrating, storing, and delivering microscopic cargo. These artificial cells are fabricated using minimal ingredients and borrow no materials from biology.To design the cell mimics, the researchers created a spherical membrane the size of a red blood cell using a polymer, a stand-in for the cellular membrane that controls what goes in and out of a cell. They pierced a microscopic hole into the spherical membrane creating a nano-channel through which matter can be exchanged, imitating a cell s protein channel.But in order to perform the tasks required for active transport, the cell mimics needed a mechanism to power the cell-like structure to pull in and expel material. In a living cell, mitochondria and ATP provide the necessary energy for active transport. In the cell mimic, the researchers added a chemically reactive component inside the nano-channel that, when activated by light, acts as a pump. When light hits the pump, it triggers a chemical reaction, turning the pump into a tiny vacuum and pulling cargo into the membrane. When the pump is switched off, the cargo is trapped and processed inside the cell mimic. And when the chemical reaction is reversed, the cargo is pushed out on demand.  Our design concept enables these artificial cell mimics to operate autonomously and perform active transport tasks that have so far been confined to the realm of living cells,  said Stefano Sacanna, associate professor of chemistry at NYU and the study s lead author.  At the heart of the cell-like structure s design is the synergy between an active element that powers it from the inside and the physical constraints imposed by the cell walls, allowing them to ingest, process, and expel foreign bodies. The researchers tested the cell mimics in different environments. In one experiment, they suspended the cell mimics in water, activated them with light, and observed them ingesting particles or impurities from the water surrounding them, illustrating a potential application for cleaning microscopic pollutants out of water. Think of the cell mimics like the PAC-MAN video game they go around eating the pollutants and removing them from the environment,  said Sacanna. In another experiment, they demonstrated that the cell mimics can swallow E. coli bacteria and trap them inside the membrane, potentially offering a new method for fighting bacteria in the body. Another future application for the cell mimics could be drug delivery, given that they can release a preloaded substance when activated.The researchers are continuing to develop and study cell mimics, including building ones that perform different tasks and learning how different types communicate with each other.Reference: Xu Z, Hueckel T, Irvine WTM, Sacanna S.

But how is it that the human brain produces these impressions even when an individual isn t actually standing on a beach, basking in the sun s rays and listening to the sound of the waves?Scientists at the University of Toronto (U of T) exploring this mystery found that the brain s prefrontal cortex   a region known primarily for its role in regulating behaviour, impulse inhibition, and cognitive flexibility   produces such general sensations based on information provided by various senses. The findings provide new insights into the poorly understood role of the prefrontal cortex in human perception.Using a combination of photographs, sounds and even heated massage stones, the researchers investigated patterns of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex as well as the other regions of the brain known to be responsible for processing stimulation from all the senses and found significant similarities. Whether an individual was directly exposed to warmth, for example, or simply looking at a picture of a sunny scene, we saw the same pattern of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex,  said Dirk Bernhardt-Walther, professor in the Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Arts & Science at the U of T, and coauthor of a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience describing the findings.  The results suggest that the prefrontal cortex generalizes perceptual experiences that originate from different senses. To understand how the human brain processes the torrent of information from the environment, researchers often study the senses in isolation, with much of prior work focused on the visual system. Bernhardt-Walther says that while such work is illuminating and important, it is equally important to find out how the brain integrates information from the different senses, and how it uses the information in a task-directed manner.  Understanding the basics of these capabilities provides the foundation for research of disorders of perception,  he said.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to capture brain activity the researchers conducted two experiments with the same participants, based on knowing how regions of the brain respond differently depending on the intensity of stimulation.In the first, the participants viewed a series of images of various scenes   including beaches, city streets, forests, and train stations   and were asked to judge if the scenes were warm or cold and noisy or quiet. Throughout, neural activity across several regions of the brain was tracked.In the second experiment, participants were first handed a series of massage stones that were either heated to 45  or cooled to 9 , and later exposed to sounds both quiet and noisy   such as birds, people, and waves at a beach. When we compared the patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex, we could determine temperature both from the stone experiment and from the experiment with pictures as the neural activity patterns for temperature were so consistent between the two experiments,  said lead author of the study Yaelan Jung, who recently completed her PhD at U of T working with Bernhardt-Walther and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Emory University. We could successfully determine whether a participant was holding a warm or a cold stone from patterns of brain activity in the somatosensory cortex, which is the part of the brain that receives and processes sensory information from the entire body, while brain activity in the visual cortex told us if they were looking at an image of a warm or cold scene,  said Jung.The patterns were so compatible that a decoder trained on prefrontal brain activity from the stone experiment was able to predict the temperature of a scene depicted in an image as it was viewed. It tells us about the relationship between someone feeling warmth by looking at a picture versus actually touching a warm object,  Jung said.Similarly, the researchers could decode noisy versus quiet sounds from the brain s auditory cortex and pictures of noisy versus quiet scenes from the visual cortex. Overall, the neural activity patterns in the prefrontal cortex produced by participants viewing the images were the same as those triggered by actual experience of temperature and noise level,  said Jung.The researchers suggest the findings may open a new avenue to study how the brain manages to process and represent complex real-world attributes that span multiple senses, even without directly experiencing them. In understanding how the human brain integrates information from different senses into higher-level concepts, we may be able to pinpoint the causes of specific inabilities to recognize particular kinds of objects or concepts,  said Bernhardt-Walther. Our results might help people with limitations in one sensory modality to compensate with another and reach the same or very similar conceptual representations in their prefrontal cortex, which is essential for making decisions about their environment.

By 1995, their numbers had dwindled to just 51 birds, including 50 isolated on tiny Stewart Island and a single male, known as Richard Henry, all alone on the mainland. Today, those numbers have grown to about 200 individuals.Now, the first genome sequencing of the species offers some surprisingly good news: despite 10,000 years of island isolation and inbreeding, the k k p appear to have lost potentially deleterious mutations rather than accumulating them. In fact, they now carry fewer deleterious mutations than now-extinct populations on the mainland once did. The analyses, conducted by researchers from Sweden and New Zealand, are reported today in the journal Cell Genomics. Even though the k k p is one of the most inbred and endangered bird species in the world, it has many fewer harmful mutations than expected,  says Dr Nicolas Dussex, a researcher at the Center for Palaeogenetics and Stockholm University. Our data shows that the surviving population on Stewart Island has been isolated for approximately 10,000 years and that during this time, harmful mutations have been removed by natural selection in a process called  purging  and that inbreeding may have facilitated it. In small populations, this type of harmful mutation can lead to genetic diseases,  adds Professor Love Dal n, of the Center for Palaeogenetics and Swedish Museum of Natural History. Our finding of a reduced number of harmful mutations is therefore important, since it means that inbreeding in the present-day population is likely to have less severe impact than we had initially thought. In the new study, the researchers report the first genome-wide analyses of the k k p , including a high-quality genome assembly. All together, they sequenced and analyzed 49 k k p genomes, including 35 representing members of the sole surviving island population and 14 representatives from the extinct mainland population.In small populations, scientific theory suggests that deleterious mutations may accumulate, leading to an increased risk for extinction. But it s also possible that detrimental gene variants, exposed through inbreeding, could instead be eliminated from the population by natural selection, a process known as purging. In the new study, the researchers now find that the latter possibility more accurately describes what s happened in the case of the k k p .The researchers say that the findings can now be put to practical use in efforts to protect and grow the remaining population. For example, the genome data can be used to select breeding individuals that may be most helpful for future generations. We show that the single male survivor from the mainland, Richard Henry, has more harmful mutations than Stewart Island birds,  Professor Dal n says. Therefore, there could be a risk that these harmful mutations spread in future generations. On the other hand, Richard Henry is also genetically distinct and may carry useful genetic diversity, he adds. This means that careful consideration must be given to pros and cons. It will therefore be important to carefully monitor the health and genomes of Richard Henry s offspring to ensure they don t introduce harmful mutations to the island population.The findings in k k p also have implications for endangered and small populations more broadly. Our results are good news, not only for k k p but also for the conservation of other highly inbred and isolated species, because they suggest that it is possible, under some circumstances, for small populations to survive even if isolated for hundreds of generations,  says Professor Bruce Robertson, of the University of Otago s Department of Zoology, who has studied k k p genetics for 25 years. While the species is still critically endangered, this result is encouraging as it shows that a large number of genetic defects have been lost over time and that high inbreeding alone may not necessarily mean that the species is doomed to extinction,  Dr Dussex says. It thus gives us some hope for the long-term survival of the k k p as well as other species with a similar population history. The researchers plan to continue investigating other extremely inbred avian and mammalian species to produce studies similar to this one. An important goal is to find out whether the health of today s k k p is a rare exception, whereas most endangered species instead tend to accumulate harmful mutations.Reference: Dussex N, van der Valk T, Morales HE, et al.

The technology is also emerging as a tool in creative arts therapies. In one of the first studies of its kind, researchers from Drexel University s College of Nursing and Health Professions and School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, examined the differences in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation between two distinct drawing tasks in VR, including with the introduction of a calming fragrance stimulus.Results of the study indicated significant differences between a rote tracing task and a creative self-expression task, with the rote tracing task showing an increase in PFC activity. It also showed there was reduced PFC activation for creative self-expressive tasks, indicating a possible relaxation response. The study demonstrates that repetitive tasks, like rote tracing, can enhance focus and the creative self-expressive tasks can reduce PFC load and induce relaxation and flow. The findings offer evidence for therapeutic aspects of creative self-expression,  said the study s lead author Girija Kaimal, EdD, an associate professor in the College of Nursing and Health Professions.Because VR makes participants detach temporarily from their physical reality into a virtual space, the sense of smell was considered in this study as an impactful stimulus, and also to promote a sense of awareness and grounding during the artmaking tasks. Although there was no significant impact of fragrance overall on PFC activation, emergent differences in responsiveness to fragrance were seen by age and gender. A fragrance, consisting of a blend of essential oils, was diffused into the lab on alternating weeks and dissipated within 30 minutes after turning off the diffuser.Participants of the study included 24 adults (18 women and six men) ranging in age from 18 to 54. They attended two one-hour sessions, scheduled at least one week apart. Participants were blinded to the fragrance stimulus and were assigned to receive either the fragrance or the non-fragrance condition for the first session through a simple randomization plan.During the sessions, participants wore an optical brain imaging sensor   the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)   to measure brain function while they engaged in VR artmaking. fNIRS has been used to monitor underlying mechanisms in neural functioning, including creativity and neural functioning. Each participant s PFC was monitored throughout the entire time the participants were engaged with the artmaking and rest conditions. fNIRS served as an objective biomarker of PFC activation in response to drawing tasks. Participants also wore a VR headset, with hand-controller equipment, that used the virtual software program, Tilt Brush by Google, to create 3-D drawings in VR. Wearable optical neuroimaging enables continuous measurement of brain function during VR use and allows studying natural dynamic processes like creating art in virtual spaces,  said Hasan Ayaz, PhD, an associate professor in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, and co-author of the study.The facilitator of the session, an art therapist, read from a protocol script with step by step instructions for the two VR drawing tasks. The rote tracing consisted of tracing basic shapes on a pre-drawn virtual template, while the creative self-expression consisted of participants creating an adapted version of the scribble drawing technique, an approach frequently used in art therapy to encourage creativity and spontaneous artistic expression. Each drawing task lasted approximately five minutes, with participants completing both tasks during the session. The directives were created also to align with the experimental method enabling comparable conditions between the rote task and the creative task. The findings also highlight how drawing tasks can potentially be used in tandem to engage different brain networks in patients,  said Kaimal.

Next, they hope to use plants to develop convenient and inexpensive technology for monitoring toxicity. These research results were published online in two papers, which appeared separately in the Journal of Plant Physiology on June 29 and the Chemosphere on July 22. Environmental monitoring is vital for understanding how pollution from chemical substances spreads through the surrounding environment. The researchers developed a new monitoring method by introducing chemical receptors from animals into plants. They were able to detect the pollutant polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), a type of dioxin, using AhR* plants Using ER* plants, they were able to detect pollution from endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The transgenic plants developed in this study do not require pretreatment and could be utilized as a way to conveniently and inexpensively monitor pollutants  toxicity. *A type of chemical receptor. Please see below for more information. Various kinds of organic pollutant exist in our surrounding environment. Well-known examples include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that were used in florescent lights and carbonless copy paper, organofluorine compounds that are used to make things water- and cooking oil-resistant, such as food packaging and kitchen utensils, and alkylphenols, used as precursors for detergents and other products. These organic pollutants have been released into the atmosphere, rivers and soil, and the elements resistant to decomposing have been ingested by fish, livestock and crops, resulting in these pollutants accumulating inside our bodies as their levels have risen in other species. Increased concentration inside the body results in various harmful effects such as cancer, fetal abnormalities and immunotoxicity. In order to prevent pollutants ingested via food from accumulating inside the human body, it is necessary to monitor contaminant levels in the environment, including water systems (rivers, lakes, oceans), fish species, the atmosphere, soil and crops. The results enable us to understand the type and concentration of pollutants in an area. This will allow appropriate measures to be put in place; for example the avoidance of growing crops where ground pollution is detected and the conduction of contamination tests on fish caught in rivers that are found to be polluted. In other words, this will enable measures to be chosen and implemented in order to mitigate the adverse effects of pollutants on humans. Environmental monitoring is the investigation of the type and concentration of pollutants in an environmental sample; this involves multiple processes. For example, to investigate a soil sample, it is necessary to add an organic solvent and then extract the chemical substance from the soil sample after heating it overnight. Next, the integrated organic solvent and chemical substance are removed from the soil and concentrated sulfuric acid is added to remove pigmentation. The concentration of organic pollutants in the sample is very low, so it is necessary to condense the extracted substance so that it reaches a concentration that is possible to analyze. Subsequently, this condensate is processed through multiple separation columns (*1) and the contaminants are eluted from the columns using organic solvents that correspond to the properties of the specific contaminants. Next, it is necessary to remove impurities from the sample in order to extract only the target pollutant. This is called purification. This series of steps (extraction, concentration and purification) is collectively called pretreating, and needs to be carried out in order to analyze trace amounts of organic pollutants in a sample. Lastly, analytical chemistry techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS) are applied to the pretreated sample. By analyzing the resulting spectral data indicating the presence of contaminating substances, it is possible to determine the type (speciation) and concentration (fixed quantity) of pollutants in the sample. Environmental monitoring is carried out according to the official analytical methods (*2) of each country and this plays a vital role in the identification and quantification of organic pollutants. However, the pretreatment stages require large amounts of sulfuric acid and various types of volatile organic solvent to be used, and this exposure is hazardous for those carrying out the processes. A more proficient technique is therefore necessary in order to turn the miniscule contaminant quantities found in environmental samples (that have undergone complex pretreatment) into specimens that can be analyzed. Furthermore, the use of expensive apparatus such as GC/MS and LC/MS (which can cost between hundreds of thousands to millions of US dollars) increases the cost of the analytical process. In order to obtain an accurate assessment the extent of contamination, it is necessary to obtain numerous environmental samples. However, it is only possible to analyze a few representative samples due to the prohibitive costs of current methods. Although instrumental analysis is suitable for determining the type and concentration of each pollutant in an environmental sample, this method cannot tell us how toxic each pollutant is, nor the overall toxicity of multiple pollutants in a single sample. In response, this research team developed a monitoring method that is completely different to previous methods, which require pretreatments and expensive apparatus in order to determine the type and concentration of pollutants in an environmental sample. Animals have proteins called chemical receptors (*3), which recognize and intercept chemical substances that penetrate the cells from outside the body. When a receptor binds to a foreign substance inside the cell, it activates the transcription of a specific gene. The regular function of the protein created by this gene is to react with the foreign substance and excrete it from the body. One example of this kind of receptor is AhR (Aryl hydrocarbon receptor). Inside the cells, AhR binds to dioxins and PCBs from contaminated food. Then it creates an enzyme that can turn these into substances that are easily dissolved in water, thus promoting their excretion from the body. Therefore, AhR plays an important role in indicating whether or not dioxins and PCBs are toxic to animals. In addition, the estrogen receptor (ER) responds to hormones created inside an animal s body and is involved in the expression of important genes for morphogenesis and growth. ER binds to the female hormone estradiol and strictly regulates the timing and amount of genetic transcription activation for the protein that should be produced in response to the hormone. However, if ER instead binds to an endocrine-disrupting chemical (*4) that has entered the body via food or water, then this disrupts the timing and level of gene transcription activation, resulting in detrimental effects. Plants, on the other hand, are unable to move once they have taken root, so their roots spread out underneath the ground in order to obtain the necessary nutrients for growth. They are able to absorb sufficient nutrients even when concentrations are low because they continue to extend their roots. In other words, plants have the ability to accumulate chemical substances that are absorbed from the soil via their roots. This research team came up with the idea for a method to monitor environmental contamination, which involves introducing animal-origin chemical receptors into a plant, and using them to detect pollutants absorbed by the plant. They created an AhR plant for PCB monitoring and an ER plant for monitoring endocrine-disrupting chemicals. When these plants were grown in soil and cultures that contained the respective contaminants, the pollutants taken up by the roots bound to the receptors inside the cells, activating the transcription of the reporter gene. Thus it is possible to monitor pollutants by detecting this reporter (Figure 1). AhR plants can detect CB126, which is the most toxic PCB (Figure 2A), as well as other types (CB77, CB118) (Figure 4). On the other hand, ER plants can detect octylphenol (OP, a type of alkylphenol) (Figure 3A) in addition to the female hormone 17 -estradiol, the insecticides fipronil and imidacloprid, and the organofluorine perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Figure 4). It is known that these chemicals are contaminating soil and water systems. The research team found that these plants demonstrated albinism and structural abnormalities such as shorter roots when pollutants were present (Figure 2B, 3B). This indicates that it is possible to detect pollutants in an observable way that is even simpler than reporter detection. The results of this research show that collecting large environmental samples for monitoring is unnecessary and that it is possible to detect contaminants using small amounts of soil (a few grams) or water (around 10 or so milliliters). Furthermore, it is possible to investigate whether an environmental sample contains toxic chemical substances with the monitoring method that uses chemical receptors to indicate toxicity. For the environmental monitoring of organic pollutants, it is vital to collect as many samples as possible in order to accurately understand the extent of the pollution. However, it is not possible for numerous samples to be analyzed under current official methods due to the amount of time and money this would require. The method that this research team has developed is far simpler, and merely requires plants to be cultivated with a small sample of soil and water, and the presence of pollutants to be assessed via reporter detection and plant growth observation. Furthermore, it also enables the toxicity of pollutants not covered by official methods to be evaluated. Therefore, this new method would be suitable for screening numerous environmental samples prior to the confirmation of the type and concentration of pollutants according to official analytical methods. In this study, the researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to monitor PCB and environmental hormones by introducing AhR and ER into plants. However, animals have many other chemical receptors aside from AhR and ER. This should consequently make it possible to apply this method to the toxicity monitoring of other chemical substances by introducing different types of receptors into plants.ReferencesStoykova P, Ohkawa H, Inui H.

University of California San Diego physicists can now claim a stake in the annals of pandemic-driven science.A team of UC San Diego researchers and colleagues at Purdue University has now simulated the foundation of new types of artificial intelligence computing devices that mimic brain functions, an achievement that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. By combining new supercomputing materials with specialized oxides, the researchers successfully demonstrated the backbone of networks of circuits and devices that mirror the connectivity of neurons and synapses in biologically based neural networks.The simulations are described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).As bandwidth demands on today s computers and other devices reach their technological limit, scientists are working towards a future in which new materials can be orchestrated to mimic the speed and precision of animal-like nervous systems. Neuromorphic computing based on quantum materials, which display quantum-mechanics-based properties, allow scientists the ability to move beyond the limits of traditional semiconductor materials. This advanced versatility opens the door to new-age devices that are far more flexible with lower energy demands than today s devices. Some of these efforts are being led by Department of Physics Assistant Professor Alex Fra  and other researchers in UC San Diego s Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing (Q-MEEN-C), a Department of Energy-supported Energy Frontier Research Center.Like biologically based systems (left), complex emergent behaviors which arise when separate components are merged together in a coordinated system also result from neuromorphic networks made up of quantum-materials-based devices (right). In the past 50 years we ve seen incredible technological achievements that resulted in computers that were progressively smaller and faster but even these devices have limits for data storage and energy consumption,  said Fra , who served as one of the PNAS paper s authors, along with former UC San Diego chancellor, UC president and physicist Robert Dynes.  Neuromorphic computing is inspired by the emergent processes of the millions of neurons, axons and dendrites that are connected all over our body in an extremely complex nervous system. As experimental physicists, Fra  and Dynes are typically busy in their laboratories using state-of-the-art instruments to explore new materials. But with the onset of the pandemic, Fra  and his colleagues were forced into isolation with concerns about how they would keep their research moving forward. They eventually came to the realization that they could advance their science from the perspective of simulations of quantum materials. This is a pandemic paper,  said Fra .  My co-authors and I decided to study this issue from a more theoretical perspective so we sat down and started having weekly (Zoom-based) meetings. Eventually the idea developed and took off. The researchers  innovation was based on joining two types of quantum substances superconducting materials based on copper oxide and metal insulator transition materials that are based on nickel oxide. They created basic  loop devices  that could be precisely controlled at the nano-scale with helium and hydrogen, reflecting the way neurons and synapses are connected. Adding more of these devices that link and exchange information with each other, the simulations showed that eventually they would allow the creation of an array of networked devices that display emergent properties like an animal s brain.Like the brain, neuromorphic devices are being designed to enhance connections that are more important than others, similar to the way synapses weigh more important messages than others. It s surprising that when you start to put in more loops, you start to see behavior that you did not expect,  said Fra .  From this paper we can imagine doing this with six, 20 or a hundred of these devices then it gets exponentially rich from there. Ultimately the goal is to create a very large and complex network of these devices that will have the ability to learn and adapt. With eased pandemic restrictions, Fra  and his colleagues are back in the laboratory, testing the theoretical simulations described in the PNAS paper with real-world instruments.Reference: Goteti US, Zaluzhnyy IA, Ramanathan S, Dynes RC, Frano A.

The study is published today in the journal Nature. It is known that bacteria can chemically modify some drugs, a process known as biotransformation. This study, led by researchers from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Toxicology Unit at the University of Cambridge and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Germany, is the first to show that certain species of gut bacteria accumulate human drugs, altering the types of bacteria in the gut and their activity.This could change the effectiveness of the drug both directly, as the accumulation could reduce the availability of the drug to the body, and indirectly, as altered bacterial function and composition could be linked to side-effects. The human gut naturally contains communities of hundreds of different species of bacteria, which are important in health and disease, called the gut microbiome. The composition of bacterial species varies significantly between people and has previously been shown to be associated with a wide range of conditions including obesity, immune response, and mental health.In this study, the researchers grew 25 common gut bacteria and studied how they interacted with 15 drugs that are taken orally. The drugs were chosen to represent a range of different types of common drugs, including antidepressant medications, which are known to affect individuals dissimilarly and cause side effects such as gut problems and weight gain.The researchers tested how each of the 15 drugs interacted with the selected bacterial strains   a total of 375 bacteria-drug tests. They found 70 interactions between the bacteria and the drugs studied, of which 29 had not been previously reported.While earlier research has shown bacteria can chemically modify drugs, when the scientists studied these interactions further they found that for 17 of the 29 new interactions the drug accumulated within the bacteria without being modified.Dr Kiran Patil at the University of Cambridge s MRC Toxicology Unit, who co-led the study, said:  It was surprising that the majority of the new interactions we saw between bacteria and drugs were the drugs accumulating in the bacteria. Until now, biotransformation was thought to be the main way that bacteria affect the availability of drugs to the body. These will likely be very personal differences between individuals, depending on the composition of their gut microbiota. We saw differences even between different strains of the same species of bacteria. Examples of drugs that accumulated in bacteria include antidepressant duloxetine and anti-diabetic rosiglitazone. For some drugs, such as montelukast (an asthma drug) and roflumilast (for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), both changes happened in different bacteria - they were accumulated by some species of bacteria and modified by others.The researchers also found the bioaccumulation of drugs alters the metabolism of the accumulating bacteria. For example, the antidepressant drug duloxetine bound to several metabolic enzymes within the bacteria and altered their secreted metabolites. The researchers grew a small community of several bacterial species together and found the antidepressant duloxetine dramatically altered the balance of bacterial species. The drug altered the molecules produced by the drug-accumulating bacteria, which other bacteria feed on, so the consuming bacteria grew much more and unbalanced the community composition.The researchers tested the effects further using C. elegans, a nematode worm commonly used to study gut bacteria. They studied duloxetine, which had been shown to accumulate in certain bacteria but not others. In worms grown with the species of bacteria that had been shown to accumulate the drug, the behavior of the worms was altered after being exposed to duloxetine, compared with worms that were grown with bacteria that did not accumulate duloxetine.Dr Athanasios Typas at EMBL, who co-led the study, said:  Only now are people recognising that drugs and our microbiome impact each other with a critical consequence to our health. Dr Peer Bork at EMBL, and a co-lead of the study, said:  This calls for us to start treating the microbiome as one of our organs.  Dr Patil said:  The next steps for us will be to take forward this basic molecular research and investigate how an individual s gut bacteria tie with the differing individual responses to drugs such as antidepressants   differences in whether you respond, the drug dose needed, and side effects like weight gain. If we can characterise how people respond depending on the composition of their microbiome, then drug treatments could be individualised. The researchers caution that the study findings are only on bacteria grown in the lab, and more research is needed to understand how bioaccumulation of medications by gut bacteria manifests inside the human body.The study started as a collaborative project at EMBL Heidelberg and was concluded in the group of Kiran Patil after his move to Cambridge.

Their release in the environment can cause severe damage to human health. Aptasensors are compact analytical devices that are intended for the fast and reliable detection of various species able to specifically interact with aptamers attached to the transducer surface.Among many others, mycotoxins are frequently mentioned as one of the most pertinent problems in food safety and human health control. They affect a broad range of agricultural products and arise in conditions of high humidity and increased temperature, promoting the growth of molds. Most mycotoxins are very toxic. They damage plasma membranes, nucleic acids, affect protein synthesis, and increase cancer risk. Biosensors utilize specific interactions between the analyte and a molecular receptor of biological origin, or a derivative of the latter, that is immobilized directly on the surface of a transducer. In biosensors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc., are attached onto the transducer so that the interaction between the analyte and the biorecognition layer affects a physical-chemical property, which is transformed into a physical signal (typically an electric signal) by the transducer, allowing the selective quantitative or semi-quantitative detection of the analyte. Biosensors show unique sensitivity and selectivity toward many contaminants. Aptamers are synthetic oligonucleotides selected from a random nucleotide library by the combination of combinatorial chemistry and affinity chromatography against target analyte. They exert extraordinary analyte binding efficiency that is comparable to that of antigen antibody interactions. For this reason, they have also been called  synthetic antibodies.  Meanwhile, aptamers are more stable toward oxidation and hydrolysis than antibodies and can be easily modified by the implementation of the terminal functional groups that are necessary for their integration in biosensor assembly and for the covalent attachment of the labels producing specific signals. Although first aptamers have been designed for binding protein molecules, their application for the detection of small molecules became popular in the past decade due to the advantages of detection of such interactions as hapten binding with antibodies. Recently, the application of biosensors utilizing aptamers (aptasensors) in mycotoxin analysis has been reviewed with emphasis to the signal measurement mode or individual mycotoxins detected. Aptamers offer unique opportunities for assembling biosensors intended for the fast and reliable detection of many biologically active species. The interest in mycotoxins detection is mostly related to the extremely low levels of their toxic concentrations and difficulties in their timely detection in agriculture and food safety control. High efficiency of aptamer selection and the specificity of target interactions make it possible to avoid labor- and time-consuming sample treatment. In many cases, a matrix effect can be eliminated by the dilution of the sample or extract. As a result, such aptasensors can be used in field as  point-on-demand  devices. They can be used easily by labor staff and to not have any high use requirements. This makes them competitive against universal conventional techniques, e.g., HPLC or capillary electrophoresis. The focus on the development of new measurement formats will be shifted to the signal-on (switch-on) aptasensors offering better metrological characteristics, especially in real sample assay. The interest in the selection of new aptamer structures and their derivatization in favor of aptasensor assembling will improve both the operational and analytical characteristics of aptasensors and result in the formation of chimeric materials combining aptasensing with the artificial 3D structures of synthetic materials. Further efforts in aptasensor design will extend to the area of monitoring the environment and foodstuffs to establish safer and more comfortable life for the population.ReferenceEvtugyn G, Porfireva A, Kulikova T, Hianik T.

One of the most significant clinical challenges today is deciding which type of treatment will work best for different patient groups with aggressive disease.In the study ""Single-cell ATAC and RNA sequencing reveal pre-existing and persistent cells associated with prostate cancer relapse  led by Professor Matti Nykter from Tampere University and Dr. Alfonso Urbanucci from Oslo University Hospital, the researchers identified a specific population of treatment-resistant cells that was present in the study samples prior to treatment and persisted when subjected to treatment. By analyzing gene expression patterns and DNA organization in these cells, we were able to predict patient responses to treatment,  says Sinja Taavitsainen, who was responsible for the bioinformatic analysis in the project.  These cells showed stem cell-like and regenerative gene expression patterns,  she continues.The study utilized a combination of prostate cancer resistance models, some of which were developed at Tampere University by the research groups of Professor Teemu Murtola and Professor Teuvo Tammela, as well as bioinformatics methods to analyze the treatment response to the commonly used drug Xtandi (enzalutamide) at the single-cell level. The results suggest that the presence of treatment-persistent cells in cancer tissue may predict the risk of recurrence and disease development. Such information can help tailor treatment for different subgroups of prostate cancer patients. Utilization of state-of-the-art methods including single-cell sequencing of RNA and chromatin state, spatial transcriptomics, and advanced bioinformatics analysis enabled us to analyze the development of treatment resistance in unprecedented detail,  Professor Matti Nykter comments.Reference: Taavitsainen S, Engedal N, Cao S. et al.

A mother s first concern is the safety of her child,  said Christina Chambers, PhD, MPH, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine and professor in the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science.  Our study, along with previous research, suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not red flags for breastfeeding mothers and their infants. The results found that more than 85 percent of the 180 breastfeeding women in the study who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reported temporary localized symptoms, such as pain, redness, swelling or itching at the injection site, and systemic side effects, including chills, muscle/body aches, fever and vomiting, with higher frequency following the second dose.Additionally, following the second dose of vaccine, women who received the Moderna brand were significantly more likely to report symptoms. A small proportion of women following the first dose of either vaccine brand reported a reduction in milk supply, and significantly more women reported a reduction in milk supply following the second dose of Moderna. We want to emphasize that the reduction in milk supply was in a small subset of women and came back fully within 72 hours after vaccination. We also cannot be certain that the supply reduction was a side effect of the vaccine or another unknown factor,  said Chambers.  What we do know is that the vaccine is incredibly effective in providing protection from COVID-19, which has proven to be a devastating and serious virus with possible long-term side effects. Irritability and poor sleep were reported in some breastfed children, but no serious adverse events. We know the many benefits of breastfeeding. Breast milk provides an abundance of nutritional components to infants that provide many health benefits, from stronger immune systems to lower rates of obesity and other conditions and illnesses,  said Chambers. Our results should encourage lactating women to get the COVID-19 vaccine and to continue to breastfeed their infants. They do not have to choose one over the other. Both are critical. The breastfeeding women recruited for the study enrolled into the Mommy s Milk Human Milk Research Biorepository at UC San Diego, which strives to understand the numerous benefits human milk offers at a molecular level and uses these findings to improve the health and development of all children. This study would not be possible without the tremendous support of our staff and students, and the women across the nation who were willing to enroll and provide breast milk samples,  said Kerri Bertrand, first author of the study and research manager of the Mommy s Milk Human Milk Research Biorepository.  Together, we are finding life-saving, evidence-based answers to crucial questions that arose when the pandemic first hit. The researchers noted that a limitation of the study was that symptoms post vaccination were self-reported and suggested additional studies will be needed to see if the findings can be generalized to a larger population.Reference: Bertrand K, Honerkamp-Smith G, Chambers CD.

If the healing process is accelerated, the immune defense is weakened, researchers at the University of Zurich have now shown. This has relevance in treating skin injuries and in tackling antibiotic-resistant germs.Natural killer cells are a specific type of immune cell. They recognize abnormal body cells such as cancer cells  or virus-infected cells, and eliminate them. An international research team led by Christian Stockmann, professor at the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Zurich (UZH), has now discovered that killer cells have another   surprising   function: They manage wound healing in the skin.  We were able to genetically modify these cells in mice to accelerate the growth of blood vessels and cause skin wounds to close more quickly. However, this has the effect of weakening the immune defense, thereby increasing susceptibility to bacterial infections,  says Stockmann.Biomedical research has focused heavily on finding ways of influencing wound-healing processes. Above all, researchers have sought methods to stimulate and accelerate the formation of new blood vessels   either directly or indirectly by influencing the immune response. However, Stockmann advises caution here:  Our results show that there may be an increased risk of infection associated with such approaches.  Another open question is the extent to which natural killer cells influence not only the speed but also the quality of wound healing   for example, the composition of connective tissue or the regeneration of hair follicles, glands and other skin components.  The most interesting question is how we can manage to accelerate wound healing while also strengthening the immune defense against infections,  says Stockmann.The immunologist and anatomist also sees further potential in killer cells. Modern cancer treatments already use therapeutic agents that activate and stimulate killer cells so that they kill the cancer cells more aggressively.  Our data suggest that these types of agents may also be effective against bacterial infections   something that should definitely be explored further in light of the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bugs,  Stockmann says. Natural killer cells communicate continuously with other defense cells and influence their activity. To do this, they secrete messenger substances known as cytokines. In their study, the researchers realized that killer cells also infiltrate skin injuries with very low levels of oxygen (hypoxia). In such tissues, killer cells change their gene expression to adapt to the lack of oxygen. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) are responsible for this adaptation. In mice, if one of these factors called HIF-1  is missing, the release of certain cytokines is impaired. In response, blood vessels grow more quickly in the skin, thus accelerating wound healing. At the same time, however, the fight against bacterial infections is restricted. The balance then tips in favor of wound healing, but with a higher risk of infection.ReferenceSobecki M, Krzywinska E, Nagarajan S, et al.

A current, representative survey by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) shows: 55 percent of the population in Germany try to avoid additives when buying food. ""Many people worry about possible health effects, at the same time, they do not feel well informed about food additives,"" says BfR President Professor Dr. Dr. Andreas Hensel. ""Food additives undergo rigorous assessments in Europe. They may only be used if their intended use is not linked to any health impairments.""An  A-Z index of food additives can be found here.  Additives are added to food for technological purposes. For example, dyes affect the appearance, emulsifiers the texture and sweeteners the taste of food - properties which most of the respondents of the study rate as being important or very important. More than half try to avoid additives when buying food. For most of the respondents, the perceived health risk of additives is greater than the rated benefit - in particular, this applies to sweeteners, dyes and flavour enhancers (each more than 40%). Above all, possible intolerances as well as the promotion of cancer and obesity are risks that the respondents associate with food additives. The results further show that the population rates their knowledge of food additives as low. On the one hand, people do not feel well informed, for example when it comes to the functions or possible health risks of food additives. On the other hand, the results show that even commonly used food additives are unknown to many. Over 40 percent of respondents each state they do not know the flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate and the sweetener aspartame. Not all are aware of the primary functional group of individual food additives: Though the majority knows that carotene is used as dye, only about a quarter of respondents knows that lactic acid is mainly used as a preservative. The term food additive is defined in Regulation (EC) No. 1333/2008. According to which it is defined as a substance with or without nutritional value that is added to food for technological purposes. Food additives may only be used in the European Union if they have previously been approved. The prerequisite for this is that the substance is harmless to health for the intended use. Furthermore, there must be a technological need for the additive and consumers must not be misled by its use. A food additive approved in the EU is given an E number and must be specified in the list of ingredients.ReferenceAdditives in food BfR consumer monitor 2021.

Their findings are reported in an article published in the Journal of Molecular Biology. The discovery facilitates the search for medications capable of sabotaging this process as soon as it begins. In the 18 months since the pandemic was declared, at least half a dozen vaccines have been approved for clinical use, but no drugs have proved effective and safe. Antivirals are indeed harder to develop, but it s very important to obtain medications for COVID-19 because the virus can escape even the best vaccines,  said Glaucius Oliva, principal investigator for CIBFar, a Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC) funded by S o Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP and hosted by the University of S o Paulo s S o Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC-USP).The article describes the molecular mechanism whereby the main protease in SARS-CoV-2 matures, enabling the virus to self-assemble and replicate its genetic material (RNA) inside host cells. The more we understand about the metabolism of the virus and the stages of its replication, the better we ll be able to identify targets in the process and develop molecules that block its inception,  said Gabriela Noske, a PhD candidate at CIBFar and first author of the article.According to Oliva, the study was basic science but has immediate applications.  Unlike other viruses, such as zika, dengue or yellow fever, this coronavirus has a main protease that acts monomerically [as an isolated molecule]. To activate and multiply the virus s RNA, the protease has to become dimeric. In other words, two copies of the protease are required so that it can cleave itself and the other proteins responsible for the viral metabolism inside the cell,  he explained.Oliva leads a multidisciplinary project supported by FAPESP, with a team of researchers at the University of S o Paulo s Biomedical Sciences Institute (ICB-USP), S o Carlos Institute of Chemistry (IQSC-USP) and Ribeir o Preto School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP-USP), as well as colleagues at S o Paulo State University (UNESP) and the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in search of antivirals to treat COVID-19 (more at: agencia.fapesp.br/33509/).","Published: September 9, 2021"

But in the process, they inhale smoke and all the compounds in it, which can be harmful at high amounts. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology have evaluated the presence of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) around firefighters actively combating blazes, finding the highest exposures among hotshot crews and those creating firebreaks.Most images of wildland firefighters show them covered from head to toe in black soot, or particulate matter, which they re breathing in along with a mixture of other compounds in smoke. Inhaling particulate matter is associated with respiratory problems, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and researchers suspect that VOCs in wildfire smoke could exacerbate these conditions. However, getting accurate estimates of firefighters  exposures to these pollutants is tough because of the extreme work environment, the different crew types and the variety of fire suppression tasks. For example, elite hotshot crews are on the front lines battling the hottest zones, while other crews may perform tasks in less intense parts of the fire s edge or use long hoses to deliver water and foam, usually to remote areas. So, Kathleen Navarro and colleagues wanted to evaluate particulate matter and VOC exposures of different types of firefighters. The researchers attached air samplers to wildland firefighters  equipment, which they used when responding to large fires in many locations across the western U.S. Then the team measured the amount of particulate matter collected over one shift, averaging 14 hours, and used that data to estimate exposures to three potentially hazardous VOCs   acrolein, benzene and formaldehyde. Their results showed the single-shift exposures to these substances were below Occupational Safety and Health Administration limits for all subjects. However, the amounts of particulate matter and formaldehyde were above the shift-averaged recommendations of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for some of the firefighters. Hotshot crews, firefighters creating firebreaks (wide gaps in vegetation to stop the fire s expansion) and personnel battling blazes in the Pacific Northwest were exposed to the highest amounts of the pollutants. Finally, the team asked the participants to qualitatively assess their smoke exposure, finding the responses aligned with the measured particulate matter exposures. To protect wildland firefighters  health, the researchers suggest that fire management should work on reducing smoke exposures of firefighters, whenever possible. This could include incorporating self-reporting of exposure and rotate personnel from tasks that regularly experience high exposures to smoke and its pollutants to less smoky ones.ReferenceNavarro KM, West MR, O Dell K, et al.

This is significant as even a moderate loss of hearing can impact social development in children, particularly when it occurs during a peak time of language acquisition,  said the study s senior author Dr. Bruce Carleton, professor at UBC s faculty of medicine s department of pediatrics and an investigator and director of the Pharmaceutical Outcomes Programme at BC Children s Hospital.Previous studies have shown up to 60 per cent of children treated with cisplatin suffer from hearing loss and 40 per cent of those children will need hearing aids.To understand the course of cisplatin-related hearing loss, Dr. Carleton and his colleagues examined data from 368 Canadian childhood cancer patients who received cisplatin and underwent a total of 2,052 audiological assessments. All of the patients had completed cisplatin therapy.Three years after starting therapy, 75 per cent of patients five years old and younger, and 48 per cent of patients older than five had experienced cisplatin-related hearing loss.One year after initiating therapy, 61 per cent of patients age five and younger had experienced cisplatin-related hearing loss. At three months, 27 per cent of the same age group had experienced hearing loss.A higher total dose of cisplatin at three months, co-prescriptions of the chemotherapy drug vincristine, and a longer duration of antibiotics administered at the same time exacerbated cisplatin-related hearing loss over time.The underlying mechanism explaining the higher occurrence of cisplatin-related hearing loss in young children remains unclear, but maturing structures within the inner ear might be more vulnerable to the toxic effects of cisplatin. These results emphasize the need for audiological monitoring with each cycle of cisplatin treatment,  said Dr. Carleton.  Further investigation is needed to illuminate why younger children are more vulnerable to hearing loss and how best to protect hearing while administering this life-saving therapy.

We have good medications to treat opioid use disorder, but about half of the people who use these medications relapse after about six months,  says Sandra Comer, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and principal investigator of the trial.  A vaccine that lasts for several months, given in combination with any of these medications, could help many more people beat their addiction and potentially protect them from an overdose death if a patient relapses. The experimental vaccine developed by Marco Pravetoni(link is external and opens in a new window), PhD, professor of pharmacology and medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School is designed to prevent oxycodone from getting into the brain, where it causes a euphoric feeling, or  high,  and  can impair the brain s breathing centers and cause death if a user overdoses.Nearly 50,000 Americans died from opioid-related overdoses in 2019, and new data from the CDC suggest that drug overdose deaths surged to a record level of 87,000 in 2020 during the pandemic, driven largely by fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Vaccine development has been a tremendous boone to humanity. This innovative work brings it to bear on the scourge of addiction with the hope of having a great impact, says Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, the Lawrence C. Kolb Professor of Psychiatry and chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.Vaccine is designed to prevent oxycodone from getting into the brainThe vaccine is designed to generate antibodies to oxycodone, a commonly abused prescription opioid. If an individual takes oxycodone after vaccination, the antibodies latch onto the drug and prevent it from crossing the blood-brain barrier. Since the opioid does not reach the brain, the user does not get high. The vaccine also may protect against death from overdose due to respiratory depression, which occurs when oxycodone acts centrally in the brain.In preclinical studies, animals that received the vaccine reduced self-administration of the drug and were protected from toxicity and signs of overdose, such as respiratory depression.Because the vaccine specifically targets oxycodone, it doesn't interfere with other opioid-based medications to treat opioid use disorder or with naloxone, a drug used to resuscitate patients who have overdosed. How the trial worksThe trial is enrolling volunteers who are opioid users but not receiving treatment with medications to combat opioid use disorder. One group of trial volunteers will be given a placebo; two other groups will receive either a low or high dose of the active vaccine.The primary aim of the trial is to determine if the vaccine is well tolerated and safe, but researchers also will seek to determine if the vaccine produces sufficient antibodies and can prevent euphoria when the volunteers are given oxycodone. The Columbia investigators have decades of experience administering opioids to people in research studies. During the vaccine trial, the volunteers will be closely monitored by a team of physicians and nurses for several weeks in an inpatient unit to look for adverse events and determine their response to oxycodone after vaccination. The researchers will then study participants  drug use behavior on an outpatient basis. Jeanne Manubay, MD, assistant clinical professor of medicine in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University, will oversee patient monitoring for the trial.As a parallel to activities at Columbia, researchers at the University of Minnesota are conducting pharmacokinetic and immunological monitoring in blood samples from participants to better understand how the vaccine works. They also hope to identify biomarkers that can predict vaccine efficacy.The study is being piloted in up to 24 volunteers. If the vaccine proves safe and shows potential efficacy, the trial will be expanded to 45 volunteers.What s next The oxycodone vaccine will need to be tested in phase 2 and phase 3 trials to determine its efficacy.Because the chemical structure of different opioids including oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl vary by drug, different vaccines are needed for each opioid. The teams at Columbia and the University of Minnesota are working to develop similar vaccines against heroin and fentanyl. Clinicians would be able to give the oxycodone vaccine to individuals who mainly use that particular drug but could also administer additional opioid vaccines for those who use other opioids or to prevent patients from switching to another opioid,  Comer says. A fentanyl vaccine could also be used to protect first responders, law enforcement, or soldiers if they inadvertently inhale carfentanil, which can be fatal in very small doses.""This article has been republished from the following materials.

They know how long parts last on average, and they can see when one is close to breaking. But knowing how many miles are left is extremely difficult, even using a supercomputer, because the exact moment a belt snaps or a battery dies is to some extent random.Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories are creating a concept for a new kind of computer for solving complex probability problems like this. They propose that a  probabilistic computer  could not only create smarter maintenance schedules but also help scientists analyze subatomic shrapnel inside particle colliders, simulate nuclear physics experiments and process images faster and more accurately than is possible with conventional computers.As part of a new microelectronics codesign research program, the Department of Energy s Office of Science recently awarded the project $6 million over the next three years to develop the idea. Sandia will be working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, New York University, the University of Texas at Austin and Temple University in Philadelphia.A codesign microelectronics project involves multidisciplinary collaboration that takes into account the interdependencies among materials, physics, architectures and software. Researchers also will look at ways to incorporate machine learning methods.The concept for a probabilistic computer runs opposite to how computers are normally built and programmed, Sandia scientist Brad Aimone said. Instead of making one that is perfectly predictable, Sandia wants one with built-in randomness that computes information differently every time. To a large degree, and at a great energy cost, we engineer computers to eliminate randomness. What we want to do in this project is to leverage randomness. Instead of fighting it, we want to use it.  said Aimone, who leads the project he and his team call COINFLIPS (short for CO-designed Improved Neural Foundations Leveraging Inherent Physics Stochasticity). What if, when I m communicating with you, I flip a coin?  Aimone said.  If heads, you act on my message; if tails, you ignore it. We want to discover how you can use randomness like this to solve problems where probability is important. Conventional computers can look at the optical illusion on the left and normally only see a vase or two faces. Sandia National Laboratories is laying the groundwork for a computer that, like our brains, can glance many times and see both. Credit: Laura Hatfield, Sandia National Laboratories COINFLIPS will also identify tasks that benefit from randomness.Probabilistic computers are part of a larger effort at Sandia to explore what computers in the future might look like. Researchers around the world have recognized that the rate at which computers are improving is slowing down, Aimone said. To break past the apparent limits of computers, scientists are looking at new, original ways of designing them.Conrad James, the Sandia manager of the COINFLIPS team said,  Several of us at Sandia have been exploring brain-inspired computing and new design approaches for years. Encouraging more communication between mathematicians, algorithm developers and device physicists led to the formation of this team and research proposal.

Examples include Lupus, where more than 80% of patients are females; Alzheimer s disease, where females have higher incidence and tend to suffer quicker cognitive decline; and COVID-19 infections that are frequently more severe in males.These sex differences may have a genetic basis that is attributable to the sex chromosomes. The X chromosome   one of the two sex chromosomes   is known to play an important role in human development and disease. New research led by Penn State College of Medicine reveals for the first time that sex-biased diseases can be attributable to genes that escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process that ensures that females do not overexpress genes on their X-chromosomes.The team developed a genetic tool that can identify these XCI escape genes, and it may also help in determining whether a female will develop a sex-biased disease and if the disease will become progressively worse over time. The tool may even be useful in understanding the sex differences in immune responses to COVID-19, as the disease is thought to produce more severe symptoms and higher mortality in men than in women. The X chromosome plays an important role in human development and disease, yet the X chromosome is frequently ignored in human genetic studies because of bioinformatics challenges in the analysis of the data,  said Laura Carrel, associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, Penn State College of Medicine.  Our new method gets around these challenges and allows us to identify XCI escape genes and assess their role in sex-biased diseases. With further research and fine-tuning, we think it could serve as a predictive tool in these disorders and could lead to the identification of new disease treatments and interventions. The human genome is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes, one pair of which is the sex chromosomes. This pair comprises two X chromosomes for females and one X and one Y chromosome for males. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated to ensure that, like in males, only one functional copy of the X chromosome   either the one inherited from the female s mother or the one inherited from her father   occurs in each cell. In females, about 30% of the genes on the X chromosome escape this inactivation   or XCI   leaving them with two functional copies of those genes,  said Carrel.  The question is, does having two copies of those genes make a female more susceptible to traits, such as lupus, that show a sex bias? To answer this question, a critical first step is to identify the XCI escape genes. Yet, conducting a chromosome-wide analysis is difficult due to the random nature of XCI in early development, as XCI affects the X chromosome that a female inherits from one parent in some cells, but the other X in other cells.In their study, which published on Aug. 23 in the journal Genome Research, the researchers developed a novel statistical model, called XCIR (X-Chromosome Inactivation for RNA-seq), that can identify XCI escape genes using bulk RNA-sequencing data, a type of genetic data. The method separately evaluates how much a gene is expressed from each X chromosome. A gene is deemed to escape XCI if the ratio of its expression from the two X chromosomes differs significantly from genes that are known to be X inactivated. The method outperforms other approaches because it can more effectively handle the errors arising from next-generation sequencing technologies and the complex biology of XCI. Our method   available in an intuitive, well-documented and freely available software   is more powerful than alternative approaches and is computationally efficient to handle large population-scale datasets,  said Dajiang Liu, associate professor of public health sciences and biochemistry and molecular biology, Penn State College of Medicine.The team applied its method to a dataset including nearly half a million people, and identified hundreds of traits, including male- or female-biased diseases such as lupus, that may be influenced by these genes that escape XCI. As shown by others, the escape genes also contribute to Alzheimer s disease and response to COVID-19 infections as well. We have developed the methodology needed to establish XCI status for population-sized datasets,  said Liu.  This work highlights the increased importance of XCI escape genes to female-biased diseases and may one day be used to accurately predict disease. Importantly, a better understanding of the sex chromosomes will be an important step in resolving health disparities between the sexes. Reference: Sauteraud R, Stahl J, James J, et al. 2021.

The interaction between age, immunity, and cancers has been understudied, particularly with the rise of cancer immunotherapies,  says study leader Rossin Erbe, a Ph.D. candidate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a member of the laboratory of study co-leader Elana Fertig, Ph.D., associate professor of oncology. Hariharan Easwaran, Ph.D., M.Sc., associate professor of oncology, also co-led this study.          Researchers have long known that cancer incidence increases exponentially as people  age, with more than two-thirds of all new cancers diagnosed in patients more than 60 years old, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Concurrently, aging also lowers general immunity, with older patients less able to mount an effective immune response to disease.Although a variety of medicines that stimulate the body s immune system to fight cancer have been approved in recent years, says Erbe, these immunotherapies are less commonly prescribed to the elderly as a result of their dampened general immunity. Yet, some clinical trials have suggested that elderly cancer patients have just as good or better responses to immunotherapies.To resolve this discrepancy and better understand how patient age might affect immunotherapy success, Erbe, Fertig, Easwaran and colleagues collected genomics and clinical data obtained from tumors and healthy tissues stored in several databases, including: the Cancer Genome Atlas; the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange; a database run by Caris Life Sciences; the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer, and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. These databases encompassed a total of 77,732 cancer patients with 31 different cancer types.Using this wealth of information, the researchers developed a publicly accessible web application called Cancer Associations with Molecular Aging (CAMA) to compare various factors across patients of varying ages in healthy and malignant tissue. Factors included mutational burden (the number of genetic mutations the cancer contained), expression of  immune checkpoint proteins--the signals that initiate and stop immune responses--that many cancer immunotherapies act on, the expression of inflammation-related pathways, such as interferon gamma, and the cell composition of cells in and around tumors, known as the tumor microenvironments.Their analysis showed that aging is associated with a variety of factors known to correlate with increased response to immunotherapies, such as an uptick in the number of mutations in tumor cells, increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins, and increased interferon gamma signaling. However, age is also associated with factors that could decrease immune response, including a lack of diversity of T cell receptors (proteins that allow immune cells to recognize and kill cancer cells), and a greater population of immune suppressing cells known as macrophages, specifically in some breast cancers.Overall, these data suggest that biomarkers for immunotherapies could still be used as a basis to select immunotherapy treatment in older patients as in young ones, says Fertig, who is also co-director of the Convergence Institute and director of quantitative sciences. This idea was supported by clinical findings in two other databases used in this study: one that tracked renal cell carcinoma patients, and another that tracked U.S. Veterans Administration patients. However, she adds, a variety of factors beyond these biomarkers must be considered when prescribing immunotherapies to older patients, such as frailty and other health conditions that could affect patients  response and ability to manage side effects. Characteristics of tumors from older patients certainly have biological properties consistent with a robust immune response,  Fertig says.  We think this is something that deserves more study using tumor atlases with prospective study designs that are tailored to study aging and immunotherapy response.

Despite the instruction to base their judgements on appearance specifically (ie the closer line should be longer) approximately half of the participants judged the lines to appear the same. When they took a photo of the lines and were asked how long they appeared in the image their responses shifted; now the closer line appeared longer. However, when they were asked again about their own view they reverted to their original response.This suggests that even when participants are made explicitly aware of what a 2D image of their vision might look like they treated actual sensory input differently   with considerable resistance to seeing what are called our ""proximal representations"" of vision (how things appear before our brains have had a chance to correct for things like relative size and distance).Lead author Dr Steven Samuel, a Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Plymouth, said:  It s complex and exciting to uncover how each of us sees and visualises different things   and the fact that half of our study population did not think in 2D was a very interesting finding. The next question to ask is why did these people think in that way? Is it that they could not think in 2D, or that they chose not to? We do not know for certain, but one explanation is that people are resistant to the principle that vision can be equated to a flat image   with  corrected  vision the only type of vision they could reasonably conceive of. This implies that adults are disinclined to entertain vision in as a proximal image, even when the context is favourable to such behaviour. However, it does not mean that they are necessarily unable to do so. Reference: Samuel S, Hagspiel K, Cole GG, Eacott MJ.

Although very frequent, this disorder is challenging to diagnose before the age of five. However, early care can compensate for these difficulties by providing specific behavioural intervention  focused on the development of skills affected by autism. This is why an interdisciplinary team at the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on the automated analysis of videos, making it possible to study children s non-verbal communication in an anonymous and standardised manner. Easy to use, this technology correctly classified 80% of cases from short videos showing a child with or without autism under 5 playing with an adult. These results, to be discovered in the journal Scientific Reports, pave the way for a tool for the early detection of autistic disorder.Autism Spectrum Disorder affects one in 54 children and is characterised by difficulties in social interactions, altered communication skills, and by the presence of repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. Consequently, children with autism often have difficulty following a standard school curriculum.  However, if the diagnosis is made before the age of 3, it is often possible to make up for these developmental delays.  Specific behavioural interventions may indeed completely change their skills acquisition trajectories and allow them to integrate a mainstream school , notes Marie Schaer, professor in the Department of Psychiatry at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and senior author of the study. The challenge therefore resides in the early diagnosis, as autism remains too often diagnosed too late, after the age of 3. This article has been republished from the following materials.

A dataset of more than 4,300 cats representing 26 breed groups revealed seven personality and behaviour traits, with significant differences observed between breeds. Cats are our most common pets, and feline behaviour is increasingly being investigated due to a range of behavioural problems. Another topic of interest in addition to behaviour traits is personality since it can be connected to behavioural problems. Compared to dogs, less is known about the behaviour and personality of cats, and there is demand for identifying related problems and risk factors. We need more understanding and tools to weed out problematic behaviour and improve cat welfare. The most common behavioural challenges associated with cats relate to aggression and inappropriate elimination,  says doctoral researcher Salla Mikkola from the University of Helsinki and the Folkh lsan Research Center. While the number of traits identified in prior research varies, activity/playfulness, fearfulness and aggression are the ones from among the traits identified in our study which occur the most often in prior studies. Litterbox issues and excessive grooming are not personality traits as such, but they can indicate something about the cat s sensitivity to stress,  Mikkola adds.

It allows communication between the cerebrospinal fluid (which bathes the brain and the spinal cord) and the cerebral blood vessels, and controls several crucial physiological responses in the brain, such as supplying nutrients and eliminating toxic waste.Researchers from the Laboratory of Cerebral and Peripheral Vascular Diseases, at the Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Toxicology, and the Institut de Neuroci ncies of the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona (INc-UAB) discovered that the arachnoid is a very important source of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid that had hitherto been found mainly in red blood cells. Researchers show for the first time that this fat, once released from the arachnoid, produces the necessary vasoconstriction in the cerebral blood vessels for the regulation of blood flow. In addition, this process facilitates the elimination of waste substances, by generating a vascular pulsation that would help expel them through the cerebrospinal fluid. The research, done on mice and human samples, has been published in the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism.The results of the study are not only relevant to understanding the physiological role of this substance in the brain blood vessels. They also suggest that in those pathological states that present the accumulation of toxic substances, such as Alzheimer s disease, SP1 in the arachnoid could be altered. This would explain why beta-amyloid peptide clearance is reduced in Alzheimer s patients, altering proper brain function and causing cognitive dysfunction and dementia.""In the study, we saw there is a decrease in S1P deposits with age, and we believe this could be affecting the elimination of beta-amyloid peptide, promoting the development of the disease"", explains Francesc Jim nez-Altay , UAB researcher leading the study. Jim nez-Altay concludes that the results of the study  situate SP1 located in the arachnoid as a potential therapeutic target to modulate cerebral blood flow, to treat cerebrovascular pathologies and those that run with toxic waste in the brain .Researchers from the Institute for Biomedical Research in Barcelona and the Eberhard Karls University in T bingen also took part in the study.Reference: Jim nez-Altay  F, Marzi J, Galan M, et al.

Their key ingredients? Viruses from plants or bacteria.The new fridge-free COVID-19 vaccines are still in the early stage of development. In mice, the vaccine candidates triggered high production of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. If they prove to be safe and effective in people, the vaccines could be a big game changer for global distribution efforts, including those in rural areas or resource-poor communities. What s exciting about our vaccine technology is that is thermally stable, so it could easily reach places where setting up ultra-low temperature freezers, or having trucks drive around with these freezers, is not going to be possible,  said Nicole Steinmetz, a professor of nanoengineering and the director of the Center for Nano-ImmunoEngineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.The vaccines are detailed in a paper published Sept. 7 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.The researchers created two COVID-19 vaccine candidates. One is made from a plant virus, called cowpea mosaic virus. The other is made from a bacterial virus, or bacteriophage, called Q beta.Both vaccines were made using similar recipes. The researchers used cowpea plants and E. coli bacteria to grow millions of copies of the plant virus and bacteriophage, respectively, in the form of ball-shaped nanoparticles. The researchers harvested these nanoparticles and then attached a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the surface. The finished products look like an infectious virus so the immune system can recognize them, but they are not infectious in animals and humans. The small piece of the spike protein attached to the surface is what stimulates the body to generate an immune response against the coronavirus.The researchers note several advantages of using plant viruses and bacteriophages to make their vaccines. For one, they can be easy and inexpensive to produce at large scales.  Growing plants is relatively easy and involves infrastructure that s not too sophisticated,  said Steinmetz.  And fermentation using bacteria is already an established process in the biopharmaceutical industry. Another big advantage is that the plant virus and bacteriophage nanoparticles are extremely stable at high temperatures. As a result, the vaccines can be stored and shipped without needing to be kept cold. They also can be put through fabrication processes that use heat. The team is using such processes to package their vaccines into polymer implants and microneedle patches. These processes involve mixing the vaccine candidates with polymers and melting them together in an oven at temperatures close to 100 degrees Celsius. Being able to directly mix the plant virus and bacteriophage nanoparticles with the polymers from the start makes it easy and straightforward to create vaccine implants and patches. The goal is to give people more options for getting a COVID-19 vaccine and making it more accessible. The implants, which are injected underneath the skin and slowly release vaccine over the course of a month, would only need to be administered once. And the microneedle patches, which can be worn on the arm without pain or discomfort, would allow people to self-administer the vaccine. Imagine if vaccine patches could be sent to the mailboxes of our most vulnerable people, rather than having them leave their homes and risk exposure,  said Jon Pokorski, a professor of nanoengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, whose team developed the technology to make the implants and microneedle patches. If clinics could offer a one-dose implant to those who would have a really hard time making it out for their second shot, that would offer protection for more of the population and we could have a better chance at stemming transmission,  added Pokorski, who is also a founding faculty member of the university s Institute for Materials Discovery and Design.In tests, the team s COVID-19 vaccine candidates were administered to mice either via implants, microneedle patches, or as a series of two shots. All three methods produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the blood against SARS-CoV-2.Potential Pan-Coronavirus VaccineThese same antibodies also neutralized against the SARS virus, the researchers found.It all comes down to the piece of the coronavirus spike protein that is attached to the surface of the nanoparticles. One of these pieces that Steinmetz s team chose, called an epitope, is almost identical between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus. The fact that neutralization is so profound with an epitope that s so well conserved among another deadly coronavirus is remarkable,  said co-author Matthew Shin, a nanoengineering Ph.D. student in Steinmetz s lab.  This gives us hope for a potential pan-coronavirus vaccine that could offer protection against future pandemics. Another advantage of this particular epitope is that it is not affected by any of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations that have so far been reported. That s because this epitope comes from a region of the spike protein that does not directly bind to cells. This is different from the epitopes in the currently administered COVID-19 vaccines, which come from the spike protein s binding region. This is a region where a lot of the mutations have occurred. And some of these mutations have made the virus more contagious.Epitopes from a nonbinding region are less likely to undergo these mutations, explained Oscar Ortega-Rivera, a postdoctoral researcher in Steinmetz s lab and the study s first author.  Based on our sequence analyses, the epitope that we chose is highly conserved amongst the SARS-CoV-2 variants. This means that the new COVID-19 vaccines could potentially be effective against the variants of concern, said Ortega-Rivera, and tests are currently underway to see what effect they have against the Delta variant, for example.Plug and Play VaccineAnother thing that gets Steinmetz really excited about this vaccine technology is the versatility it offers to make new vaccines.  Even if this technology does not make an impact for COVID-19, it can be quickly adapted for the next threat, the next virus X,  said Steinmetz.Making these vaccines, she says, is  plug and play:  grow plant virus or bacteriophage nanoparticles from plants or bacteria, respectively, then attach a piece of the target virus, pathogen, or biomarker to the surface. We use the same nanoparticles, the same polymers, the same equipment, and the same chemistry to put everything together. The only variable really is the antigen that we stick to the surface,  said Steinmetz.The resulting vaccines do not need to be kept cold. They can be packaged into implants or microneedle patches. Or, they can be directly administered in the traditional way via shots.Steinmetz and Pokorski s labs have used this recipe in previous studies to make vaccine candidates for diseases like HPV and cholesterol. And now they ve shown that it works for making COVID-19 vaccine candidates as well.Next StepsThe vaccines still have a long way to go before they make it into clinical trials. Moving forward, the team will test if the vaccines protect against infection from COVID-19, as well as its variants and other deadly coronaviruses, in vivo.Reference: Ortega-Rivera OA, Shin MD, Chen A, et al.

A new study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, published by Elsevier, found that over 50 localities in the United States allow indoor smoking at these businesses, exposing customers and employees to secondhand cannabis smoke (SHCS). While many states maintain strong tobacco smoking and vaping bans to protect public health, our research reveals that some state and local laws exempt cannabis smoke from clean air laws and open the door to smoke-filled businesses, defeating decades of public health advances,  said first author Thomas L. Rotering, MPH, of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, and the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. The researchers systematically searched legal databases, public reporting, government websites and local laws that address cannabis smoking lounges. They found wide variation in how state and local governments address SHCS exposure in these businesses. All of the 11 states that have legalized adult-use cannabis as of June 2020 prohibit consumption in public places, but six states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan) allow onsite consumption in licensed cannabis businesses subject to local government approval. No state prohibits local governments from implementing more rigorous requirements. Massachusetts only allows onsite consumption through vaporization or other nonsmoking forms of consumption involving heat. Although the only effective means of preventing the health problems associated with SHCS is to require a smoke-free environment, most local laws either do not address SHCS or use ineffective ventilation or engineering requirements. Of the 56 localities that permit onsite cannabis consumption businesses, only 9% require that indoors be smoke-free. Twenty-three percent of local governments provide for smoking in isolated rooms but only require that the smoke not drift to nonsmoking areas or that there be a smoke-free employee viewing area. Other common local legal requirements address onsite odor control, ventilation/filtration, and building location. Such requirements are often vague, and the investigators observe that they resemble the tobacco industry s  accommodation  framework by allowing smoking inside and positioning ventilation or engineering controls as solving secondhand smoke.  After decades of progress in clearing the indoor air of tobacco smoke, we are seeing it replaced with cannabis smoke using the same discredited arguments the tobacco industry used in its unsuccessful fight against tobacco smoke restrictions. We need to learn from the past and keep the air clean for all,  commented senior investigator Stanton A. Glantz, PhD, retired from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, and the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. Some cannabis advocates argue that designating indoor spaces for renters, tourists and people experiencing homelessness to smoke or vape is the only reasonable alternative to illegally consuming in public or exposing nonsmokers to SHCS. The investigators suggest that reasonable alternatives may include permitting outside, out-of-view cannabis use at retailers, or allowing only the use of non-inhalable modes of administration that do not pollute the air. Local officials could consider allowing multiunit housing or other places serving these groups to create outdoor, designated consumption smoking areas out of public view. Policymakers should be made aware that ventilation and other engineering interventions cannot fully protect workers and patrons.  Health authorities and local leaders should educate policymakers on the science of secondhand smoke remediation and advocate for the same standards for secondhand cannabis smoking and vaping that apply to tobacco, particularly because other cannabis administration modes do not pollute the air,  said the authors in their paper.  Where onsite smoking or vaping is permitted, even measures such as truly separate indoor and outdoor smoking areas may reduce but not eliminate SHCS exposure to patrons, staff and residents.

Vaccines work by immunizing the body against a virus to prevent infection; however, there is no cure for individuals who do become infected (for example, at birth). Hepatitis B infection can lead to liver damage and even cancer, posing a threat to public health.Understanding the fundamental steps of viral infection can help design drugs to interrupt these processes and prevent chronic infection. With this rationale, researchers from the Beckman Institute and the Department of Chemistry modeled the process of capsid disassembly of the hepatitis B virus at an unprecedented atomic level. The team included Zhaleh Ghaemi, the study's lead author and a research scientist in chemistry; Emad Tajkhorshid, a professor of biochemistry; and Martin Gruebele, a professor of chemistry. Their paper, titled  Molecular mechanism of capsid disassembly in hepatitis B virus,  is published in PNAS. A viral capsid is a structure that contains a virus s genetic material; in the case of hepatitis B, the capsid is an icosahedral structure about 36 nanometers in diameter and composed of 240 identical proteins. Capsid disassembly, wherein the capsid physically breaks apart, is essential for a virus to infect a cell, as it allows the virus to release its own genetic material into the host cell's nucleus and eventually use the host cell s replication machinery to multiply. Understanding this process on an atomic level is imperative for one therapeutic approach to combat hepatitis B and other similar infections.  Over the past few decades, the developments of advanced simulation software such as NAMD, developed here at UIUC, and a more accurate treatment of interactions between atoms, enabled us to simulate a system of this size and complexity,  Ghaemi said.  A novel aspect of this work is the development and application of a method that allowed us to perturb the capsid efficiently,  said Tajkorshid, who directs the NIH Biotechnology Center for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics.  Five to ten years ago, we had neither the computational power nor an appropriate method to carry out this sort of work.  Armed with cutting-edge computational capabilities, the team pried apart the hepatitis B viral capsid disassembly process.  On the experimental side, it s a situation where you can t have your cake and eat it too. You can do microscopy experiments, but there is always a trade-off. There are experiments that will give you partial insights. Some will give you higher spatial resolution, some better time resolution, but there isn t an experiment like these simulations that we did which will just show you what happens, atom by atom,  Gruebele said. Using newly developed computational techniques to apply mechanical stress, the researchers identified which areas of the capsid impact the disassembly process. Surprisingly, specific regions of the capsid protein were found to contribute to the breakage more than others, and not in the pattern that had previously been surmised based on mechanical properties alone. By probing and investigating capsid disassembly, which was set to efficiently occur in just a few nanoseconds of simulation, the team predicted that the first cracks that lead to disassembly are a result of the capsid structure expanding by just 2.5%. This high level of accuracy would not be possible with many techniques available today.  The work here is based on simulations, but we can confirm the simulations with experiments that involve mutating specific amino acids predicted to be  hot spots  for disassembly,  Ghaemi said. The unique expertise contributed by each team member was vital in developing the method, simulating the process, and predicting phenomena with staggering precision.

They have especially focused on insect protein use and soybean-protein use in the production of broilers.The results support previous research suggesting that insect protein has the greatest potential to reduce the food-related carbon footprints of European consumers, if edible insects   such as crickets, flies, and worms   are consumed directly or processed as food. Preparation methods include eating them fresh, or drying and processing them into flour for use in bread or pasta. ""Our results indeed suggest that it is more sustainable to use insect protein for food rather than to use it to replace soybean meal in animal feed. Yet we found that a shift to using low-value food industry side stream products   such as catering waste or by-products, for example, from fish processing   in insect production for chicken feed is key to decisively increasing the carbon footprint benefits of using insect protein over soybean meal protein,"" says Professor All this is important and timely, because as a part of the current climate change debate, concerns have been raised over the increasing deforestation associated with the rapid expansion of global soybean cultivation, which is a major protein source for feeding livestock raised to be food for humans.

In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, researchers from ETH Zurich describe how they applied the science of rheology to the seemingly quaint purpose of improving the quality of a cup of black tea.Rheology refers to the study of the flow of matter, primarily in a liquid or gas state. The branch of physics has countless practical applications in engineering, geophysics, physiology, biology, pharmaceuticals, and materials science for the manufacture of products from cement to paint to chocolate. In their study, the researchers describe the interfacial phenomenon in a cup of tea left to cool after steeping. A thin film at the air-water interface can form, sometimes observable by the naked eye, and when disturbed, cracks visibly like sea ice. Using interfacial rheology, they assess the mechanical properties of the film, the formation of which is affected by water hardness, acidity, sugar or milk, tea concentration, and brewing temperature.  In interfacial rheology, experiments performed involve a metal device placed at the surface of the tea,  said co-author Caroline Giacomin.  The rotation of that device is carefully controlled, and the resistance to rotation that the film applies is what allows us to determine its strength.  While a number of reasons account for the film formation, residual waxy coating from tea leaves was long thought to be the primary culprit. But research from the 1990s disproved this and subsequently helped scientists determine that calcium carbonate contributes the greatest amount to compounds that react with the tea to form a film.  Tap water in many regions comes from limestone aquifers, where calcium carbonate, a harmless compound that can make water taste  crisper,  is found,  Giacomin said.  Many homes in the U.S. Midwest have water softeners to reduce this in their water supply to prevent buildup on faucets.  However, she added,  if you were to make a cup of tea in perfectly pure water, it would not form a film at all, but the tea would taste quite bitter.  The researchers found conditions contributing to the formation of the strongest film, namely chemically hardened water, may be industrially useful in packaged tea beverages for prolonged shelf life and for emulsion stabilization of milk tea products. Conversely, conditions forming weakened films may be useful for dried tea mixes.  The addition of an acidic component, like citrus, in a dried tea blend will reduce the visibility of the film and add flavor,  said Giacomin.ReferenceGiacomin CE, Fischer P.

Previous studies have achieved this only by using powerful viral factors that are not common in human cancers.Since many human cancer types still lack specific diagnostic markers or effective targeted therapies, these mechanistic insights are important for developing novel diagnostic and treatment options.Novel approach revealed cellular identity as a major determinant of how human cell transforms into a cancer cellThe research group of Professor Jussi Taipale that belongs to the Academy of Finland s Center of Excellence in Tumor Genetics Research, developed a novel cellular transformation assay for studying the mutations that cause human cancer on a molecular level.Using this novel assay, researchers were able to identify a minimal set of defined factors that can convert a normal human fibroblast cell to a liver cancer cell. They also discovered that cellular lineage and differentiation stage are critical factors that determine cell s response to oncogenic mutations. This provides a mechanistic proof-of-principle for understanding why certain mutations cause cancer in particular tissues.The study led by Dr. Biswajyoti Sahu was recently published in Oncogene. This is a first-of-its-kind study that introduced a novel approach to systematically investigate molecular determinants causing human cancers  says Dr. Sahu.The innovative feature of the novel cellular transformation assay is to utilize cellular transdifferentiation, in which human fibroblast cells are converted to a different cell type using defined transcription factors, and to expose the cells to oncogenic factors during this transdifferentiation process. Since previous cancer genome sequencing studies have reported mutations in over 250 genes in different human tumor types, novel methods for studying their effects on tumorigenesis are highly warranted , Dr. Sahu points out.New openings for the development of diagnosticsCancer can arise from various different human tissues. Although the common feature of all cancers is malignant growth caused by mutations in genes regulating critical cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, same mutations do not cause cancer in all tissues. However, why a particular mutation causes cancer in some tissues but not in others is not well understood.In this study, the authors identified the set of factors that can make normal cells convert to liver cancer cells by systematically studying different mutations that have previously been reported in human liver tumors. Our focus was on liver cancer, but importantly, similar approach can be used for studying various other human cancer types. Thus, this study can have a major impact on better understanding of tumorigenic mechanisms in the future  tells Professor Taipale.Reference: Sahu B, Pihlajamaa P, Zhang K, et al.

Avian malaria now affects somewhere between 13 and 14 per cent   on average   of all wild birds worldwide,  said Dr Wells.  It s caused by a group of blood parasites   known as haemosporidian parasites   and, much like human malaria, is transmitted via blood-feeding insects like mosquitos.  It can t harm humans but is known to have significant impacts on bird populations.  For example, when avian malaria was introduced into Hawaii in the late 1800s to early 1900s, it was one of the major causes of extinction of about one-third of the 55 known species of Hawaiian honeycreepers.  We ve found that there are hotspots transmitting these parasites across the world.  Co-author Dr Alan Fecchio from the Federal University of Mato Grosso in Brazil said:  Birds are most often infected with these parasites in the Sahara-Arabian region, but local hotspots with surprisingly high infection rates can be found in North America, Europe and Australia, depending on different parasite variants.  In Europe, some of these blood parasites are causing high infection rates in our songbirds, including the common blackbird (Turdus merula) and coal tits (Parus ater).  The research team compiled and analysed what is likely the largest data set of wild bird infections with avian malaria parasites to date, with more than 53,000 wild birds examined. They combined infection data with remotely sensed environmental data, such as climate or forest conditions, and bird life history information, such as body size and migration patterns, into computer models to identify which factors best described the infection risk with avian malaria parasites. Co-author Dr Nicholas Clark from the University of Queensland in Australia, said predicting which conditions facilitate the infection of wild birds with avian malaria is crucial for understanding infectious disease hazards.  Since each bird species is unique in its ecological niche and is differently exposed to disease-transmitting insects during breeding and migration, infection risks are not the same for different bird species.  Conditions that enable infection in different areas across the world are completely context-dependent.  For example, long distance migrating birds were more likely to be infected in some continents but less likely in others.  Dr Wells concluded:  There s no easy answer with so many factors at play, but we re going to continue our research to find out how to best protect the world s bird species from this deadly disease and better understand the spillover from harmful parasite from one species to another.

The first author of the study is Julia Lewis, a research associate in Girardi s lab.The driving force behind skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma is ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. UV energy causes mutations in skin cells and those mutated cells proliferate before eventually growing into skin cancer.But they get help from an unlikely source.For the study, Girardi s team used genetic expression profiling, cell isolation, and preclinical models of skin cancer development in the lab to reveal that specific immune cells   and growth factors they produce   stimulate mutated cancer precursor cells to reproduce. All of this happens microscopically, before any visible tumor is apparent on the skin,  Girardi said.  These are very early events in the development of skin cancer. Girardi said that during chronic UV exposure to the skin, Langerhans cells, a type of immune cell found in the epidermis, stimulate other immune cells to produce the growth factors including interleukin-22. Normally, interleukin-22 helps to repair damaged skin; but in this instance, it gives precursor cancer cells safe harbor to multiply.Importantly, Girardi s team discovered that all of the immune cells involved in the process expressed a protein called ROR t. The researchers found that when they applied an ROR t inhibitor to the skin s surface, it greatly reduced the growth of the mutated cells. We think this opens the door to the possibility of using similar inhibitors to prevent skin cancer from developing on people with sun-damaged skin, particularly those individuals at greatest risk, including fair-skinned people, those with a personal or family history of skin cancer, and those with immune suppression because they re the recipient of an organ transplant,  Girardi said.Co-authors of the paper are Patrick Monico, Fatima Mirza, Suzanne Xu, Sara Yumeen, Jack Turban, and Anjela Galan, all of Yale.The research was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.Reference: Girardi M, et al.

Point-of-care testing that can provide immediate results is an urgent need.Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and Omega Optics Inc. investigated the opportunities and challenges in developing rapid COVID-19 sensing techniques. They discuss the prospects of optical biosensors for point-of-care COVID-19 testing in the journal Applied Physics Reviews, from AIP Publishing.""Due to growing cases resulting from more transmissible variants around the world and the need to prevent and control cases and outbreaks when they arise, we should be utilizing rapid testing more commonly to detect and stop the spread before hitting the transmission peak,"" said Aref Asghari, one of the authors.One of the most promising solutions to accurate rapid testing is using optical biosensors. When a virion is present on the surface of an optical sensor, its interaction with a light beam on the sensor affects the light's properties, causing a measurable shift in the light signal. Even with only a very small viral dosage, the system can reliably detect the coronavirus in real time.""In case of COVID-19, the viral load at the onset of infection can be low enough to not be detected by many commercially available methods,"" Asghari said. ""Therefore, viral detection, especially at earlier infection stage, can be very challenging.""There are a number of different ways in which this interaction can be utilized and improved upon, such as integrating it with measurements of plasma oscillations or incorporating graphene into its fabrication process.Each potential configuration uses a different mechanism to sense the virus and has its own set of advantages and drawbacks, but the primary takeaway remains the same. Even with the widespread availability of vaccines, the pandemic cannot be overcome without developing faster ways to determine infection, particularly as mutations and new variants of the virus continue to arise.""The combination of vaccines and rapid tests will drive down community transmission to a point where we can effectively eliminate the virus,"" Asghari said.Reference: Asghari A, Wang C, Yoo KM, et al.

Results are therefore regarded as preliminary and should be interpreted as such. Find out about the role of the peer review process in research here. For further information, please contact the cited source.As society transitions to ""living with COVID-19"", having access to both efficient and accurate screening tools is integral. In hospital environments where dozens of patients and staff cross paths each day, we must be able to quickly distinguish between patients that are presenting with COVID-19 and those that are not to ensure safety and infection control.  CURIAL-Rapide is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening test that has been developed by researchers at the University of Oxford. It is an updated form of the CURIAL-1.0 system that was originally tested and released in 2020, and utilizes data from clinical tests performed at the patient's bedside to screen for COVID-19.In a new preprint, the research team behind CURIAL-Rapide share their data from a real-world study that aimed to determine the logistical and safety performance of CURIAL-Rapide vs standard-care practisSes. Technology Networks spoke with Dr. Andrew Soltan, NIHR academic clinical fellow at the John Radcliffe Hospital and first author of the study, to learn more about the AI test and why it is faster than PCR or lateral flow tests. Molly Campbell (MC): Why do we need other methods   in addition to lateral flow tests   to screen for COVID-19, particularly in clinical settings?Andrew Soltan (AS): Although turnaround times for the gold-standard test   the PCR   have come down during the pandemic, these typically still require 12-24 hours to return in larger UK hospitals, and much longer in more remote areas. This can delay care, prevent patients from being transferred to wards and ultimately increase strain on the hospital.Lateral flow tests have been adopted in emergency departments to try and solve this problem, but this has been fraught with problems because of poor performance. An evaluation at Oxford University Hospitals, our group of hospitals in Oxfordshire, showed that lateral flow tests gave negative results for almost half (43%) of all COVID-19 patients being admitted to our hospitals.As patients in hospital are amongst the most vulnerable groups, the poor performance of lateral flow tests potentially places patients at risk   for example, if a patient with COVID-19 was unintentionally transferred to a ward of uninfected patients.MC: The CURIAL-Rapide AI screening test was developed using routine healthcare data from electronic health records for 115,394 patients and 72,310 admissions. Can you please expand on this?AS: We developed CURIAL by teaching it to discriminate patients with COVID-19 from patients who did not have COVID-19, but instead a broad spectrum of alternative conditions. To do this, we needed to make sure that the data used to teach the AI was accurately labeled, but problems with testing during the first wave meant this was not straightforward.We addressed this by training the AI using patients who were certain to have COVID-19 that had tested positive by PCR, and patients certain to not have COVID-19, by looking back to before the pandemic and using a broad cohort of over one hundred thousand ""pre-pandemic"" patients. This allowed us to have breadth of presentations and confidence in labelling. With CURIAL-Rapide, we built on the initial model by optimizing the input tests required, cutting the time needed for a result.Next, we wanted to test (or validate) whether the AI performed well enough. We did this by collaborating with three other NHS trusts and looking at how CURIAL-Rapide performed in their emergency departments. We also tested CURIAL-Rapide for all patients coming to our hospital during the second wave in the UK. In every evaluation, we found that the AI performed consistently and reliably. When we compared the AI to lateral flow tests, we found that it was much more effective at identifying patients being admitted with COVID-19.MC: Can you describe the structure of the three-month evaluation study? Were there any limitations?AS: We deployed CURIAL-Rapide at our hospital s emergency department (the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford) in February 2021 and assessed how the test performed and how long it took for results to come back.We measured how long it took for AI results, lateral flow test results and PCR results to come back for our patients, and found that CURIAL-Rapide results were available 26% sooner than lateral flow tests.In addition to this, we evaluated performance of the AI for all patients admitted to three other NHS trusts (University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Bedfordshrie Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Portsmouth University Hospitals NHS Trust), and found that the AI was consistent across the trust.Our study was UK-based and we therefore cannot extrapolate our evaluation to other countries. We also do not yet know how CURIAL would fit in as a decision-support aid   i.e., how clinicians would interact with the test, and whether it would help clinicians make better decisions overall. A randomized controlled trial would give the very best evidence, however the study presented here gives an accurate report of how CURIAL-Rapide performed in the real-world and is therefore still significant.MC: How does the cost of an AI-informed screening test compare with tests that rely on biological markers?AS: CURIAL uses clinical data that is already collected for virtually all patients being admitted to hospital   and therefore requires no extra tests to be performed. This means that AI-based screening can be performed at essentially no cost, and with no waste.MC: What are the next steps for CURIAL-Rapide?AS: We are applying for further funding to roll out CURIAL-Rapide and CURIAL-Lab across the NHS. We would be particularly interested to hear from doctors and healthcare workers abroad who might be interested in using CURIAL-Rapide in their practice.Dr. Andrew Soltan was speaking to Molly Campbell, Science Writer for Technology Networks.

Combining behavioural and brain data, Hungarian researchers at the Department of Ethology, E tv s Lor nd University, the MTE-ELTE Lend let Neuroethology of Communication Research Group and the MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group revealed exciting similarities between dog-owner and infant-mother attachment.Companion dogs develop a strong relationship with their owners: they do not just love their human caregivers, they are attached to them.That is, they use the owner as a secure base at unfamiliar places and as a safe haven in case of danger, just as we see it in infant-mother relationships. In children s brains, attachment is associated with reward-responses. But what brain mechanisms can be associated with attachment in dogs?To answer this question, Hungarian researchers combined behavioural and brain data of family pets. Dogs  attachment behaviour towards the owners was assessed with the Strange Situation Test, and their brain activity was measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the MRI, dogs listened to praising and neutral (meaningless for dogs) speech spoken by their owner and a familiar person. A video abstract of the research. Credit: ELTE via YouTube  To study the brain mechanisms behind dog-owner attachment is particularly exciting, because it can help to understand how similar this unique bond between individuals of different species can be to other well-known relationships between conspecifics (e.g. infant-mother attachment). Some years ago we discovered that dog brains are sensitive to verbal praises, but it remained unexplored how the relationship with the speaker affects this sensitivity.   Anna G bor, lead author of the study, explains.The current results show that the reward center of the dog brain is more sensitive to the owner s than to a familiar person s praise.Moreover, more attached dogs showed greater neural reward-response for the owner s voice. These findings mean that (1) dogs can recognise their owner s voice, and (2) the owner s voice is more rewarding for more attached dogs even if it has no praising content. The basic function of attachment is to keep the dependent individual (infant, dog) in the proximity of the caregiver. Our results point out that in dogs, just like in infants, not only positive interactions with the caregiver, but even listening to their neutral voice is rewarding,  explains M rta G csi, last author of the study. These findings reveal that dog-owner and infant-mother relationships are more similar than previously thought.Reference: G bor A, Andics A, Mikl si  , Czeibert K, Carreiro C, G csi M.

That s the result of new UC Riverside research showing, contrary to popular belief, the tiny birds do have an active sense of smell.Researchers have known for some time that vultures have a highly sensitive sense of smell, with some species being compared to  airborne bloodhounds.  This is due in part to their large olfactory bulbs   tissue in the brain that controls smell. However, hummingbirds  olfactory bulbs are, like the rest of their bodies, extremely small. Earlier studies were unable to demonstrate that hummingbirds showed a preference for the smell of flowers containing nectar. In addition, flowers pollinated by birds generally don t have strong odors, unlike those pollinated by insects. For these reasons, scientists did not previously believe the birds possessed the ability to smell things. UCR scientists have now shown for the first time that not only can hummingbirds smell insects, but also that scent may help them stay out of danger while looking for nectar to eat. A paper describing their experiments has now been published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. This is pretty exciting, as it is the first clear demonstration of hummingbirds using their sense of smell alone to make foraging decisions and avoid contact with potentially dangerous insects at a flower or feeder,  said Erin Wilson Rankin, associate entomology professor and study co-author.For their experiments, the researchers allowed more than 100 hummingbirds to choose between two feeders, either sugar water alone, or sugar water plus one of several chemicals whose scent signaled the presence of an insect. There were no visual differences between the two feeders offered in each of the experiments.Tests included the scent deposited on flowers by European honeybees, an attraction chemical secreted by Argentine ants, and formic acid, a defensive compound produced by some Formica ants which is known to harm birds as well as mammals.  If a bird has any exposed skin on their legs, formic acid can hurt, and if they get it in their eyes, it isn t pleasant,  Rankin said.  It s also extremely volatile. The hummingbirds avoided both of the ant-derived chemicals, especially the formic acid. However, they had no reaction at all to the honeybee scent, which is known to deter other bees from visiting flowers. To ensure it was the chemical itself the birds were reacting to, and not simply a fear of new smells, the researchers did an additional test with ethyl butyrate, a common additive in human food.  It smells like Juicy Fruit gum, which is not a smell known in nature,  Rankin said.  I did not enjoy it. The birds did not care about it though and didn t go out of their way to avoid it. Rankin said the study raises new questions about the underrated importance that scent plays in birds  foraging decisions and specifically, hummingbird foraging. Ashley Kim, first author on the paper and current ecology doctoral student at UC San Diego, was based in the Rankin Lab at UCR while participating in this project.   This research made me understand the importance of studying the basic biology and natural history of animals that are commonly overlooked,  she said. Kim s participation was supported by the National Science Foundation, through its Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, which helps undergraduates get hands-on experience conducting research.Rankin typically studies trophic interactions, or as she explains it, the science of  who eats who  in nature.  Hummingbirds and insects might be competing for floral resources,  she said.  Their foraging decisions help us understand how the ecosystem functions, and any actions that ultimately might be needed for conservation. Reference: Kim AY, Rankin DT, Rankin EEW.

Beliefs vary depending on peoples  age, race, socioeconomic background and their geography.The findings, published Open Access today in the journal Annals of Medicine, show   in particular   that younger adults; people who are non-Hispanic Black or other/multiple races; those of lower socioeconomic status; and people living in the southeastern region of the country, remained least likely to have had the vaccine   or willing to do so from January to March 2021.People who had previously had COVID-19, or were unsure if they d had it, were also less likely to intend to get vaccinated.Overall, though, people who are reluctant toward the vaccine only represents around 10% of the US public. Who, according to the findings of this survey, quote not trusting the government (40%) or not trusting the efficacy of the vaccine (45%) as to their reasons for not wanting the vaccine.As for the larger group   those stating they would probably by jabbed but haven t been so yet   they state reasons as to not having it so far as: The results provide timely information on disparities in vaccine confidence. And lead author Dr Kimberly Nguyen of Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, says she hopes the results can inform and target efforts to improve vaccine uptake across all communities. Highlighting vaccines as important for resuming work, school, and social activities is critical to preventing the spread of COVID-19 incidence and bringing an end to the pandemic,  she said. Also, communicating to the public about the need for vaccination despite a history of covid infection is also important since it remains uncertain if infection provides immunity and if so, how long this protection will last. Vaccines are a huge step forward in overcoming the pandemic, but successful implementation of a vaccination program depends upon their uptake. As of 8 August 2021, 181 million, or more than 70% of US adults aged 18 or older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. But in recent months, the US vaccination rate has slowed down considerably despite widespread vaccine availability.Previous studies carried out in September and December 2020, suggested only 50% of US adults planned to get a COVID-19 vaccine once it was available to them.Dr Nguyen and her co-authors (Ms Nguyen, Dr Corlin, Dr Allen, and Dr Chung) examined changes in vaccine uptake and willingness to get vaccinated by sociodemographic characteristics and geographic areas from 6 January to 29 March 2021 using data collected in the US Census Bureau s Household Pulse Survey involving 75,000 respondents.The results showed that receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and definite intent to get vaccinated increased from 54.7% to 72.3%. However, intent varied:  In addition to age and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccine intentions, disparities continue to exist among vulnerable populations, such as among individuals with lower levels of education and income. Providing clear messages on vaccine safety and effectiveness is important for increasing vaccination uptake and confidence among these groups,  said Nguyen.Vaccination receipt and intent increased from early January to late March across all geographical regions, but this continued to be the lowest in Region 4 (southeastern states   Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee) compared to all other regions.The highest increase of intent to have the vaccine, by a group of people, was among non-Hispanic black adults (a 30.3 percent increase). Lower vaccination and intent among these southeastern states may be driven by access issues, such as vaccine supply, vaccination clinic availability, lack of prioritization of vulnerable groups, or vaccine hesitancy,  said Nguyen. Potential ways to increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage and intent include increasing confidence in vaccines among vulnerable groups, monitoring and addressing barriers to vaccination, directing vaccines to vulnerable communities, offering free transportation to vaccination sites or opening sites at more accessible locations, and engaging communities to build trust and collaboration. More efforts are needed to understand these differences among states to identify best practices for improving vaccine uptake. As with all research, the findings of this study include limitations. This includes that this sample potentially might not be fully representative of the general U.S. adult population.Reference: Nguyen KH, Nguyen K, Corlin L, Allen JD, Chung M.

A key mechanism for saving energy is electron bifurcation, a reaction that  splits  the energy of a pair of electrons, making one more strongly reducing at the expense of the other. Researchers from the Max Planck Institutes for Terrestrial Microbiology (Marburg) and Biophysics (Frankfurt am Main) have discovered a massive enzyme complex from a methanogenic archaeon that directly transfers electrons from the electron bifurcation reaction to CO2 reduction and fixation. Their detailed insights into these efficient energy-transforming processes may open new possibilities for sustainable biotechnological development.An estimated 1 billion tons of methane is produced each year by anaerobic microorganisms called methanogenic archaea. As methane is a potent greenhouse gas, increasing atmospheric concentrations of methane threaten lives and livelihoods. On the other hand, capturing the methane produced biologically by anaerobic digestion of wastes and wastewater may represent a renewable source of fuel. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of microbial methane formation has the potential to stimulate and support environmental conservation efforts. Methanogenic archaea successfully compete by performing methanogenesis, one of the final steps of anaerobic breakdown of organic nutrients, often under extreme conditions. Most methanogenic archaea produce methane from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen gas (H2) via the methanogenic cycle, involving multiple enzyme reactions. In typical methanogenic habitats, this reaction releases only a small amount of energy, so methanogens need highly efficient enzyme systems to thrive in such energy-limited environments. A particularly sophisticated step of the methanogenic cycle is called flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB). In this reaction the energy of a pair of electrons is split, so that one electron becomes more strongly reducing at the expense of the other. It was assumed that methanogens transfer the high-energy electron from this reaction to fix CO2 via a small electron carrier protein, ferredoxin, which diffuses freely in the cell. Surprisingly, a research team at the MPI for Terrestrial Microbiology (Marburg) and the MPI of Biophysics (Frankfurt) has shown that such an electron carrier is not needed to transfer electrons from FBEB to CO2 reduction. The researchers purified enzyme complexes consisting of formate dehydrogenase (Fdh), heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (Fmd) from the methanogenic archaeon Methanospirillum hungatei. This species, as well as many other methanogens, is often found in anaerobic digesters that treat organic wastes, such as municipal wastewater or industrial waste. The researchers characterized the function of the enzyme complexes with enzyme assays and solved structures by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structures revealed that the enzymes catalyzing the last and first steps of the methanogenic cycle form a massive complex, thereby directly connecting two steps, namely the formate-driven FBEB and reduction of CO2, without using the diffusible electron-carrier protein ferredoxin.  Our structural analysis revealed a gigantic enzyme complex,  says Tomohiro Watanabe, lead author of the study.  An electron-transfer chain protein, polyferredoxin, forms a conductive pathway that leads the high-energy electrons from FBEB directly to CO2 reduction, rather than via a soluble carrier. This means there is less opportunity to lose these precious electrons.  Structural comparisons and previously published interaction assays suggest that such higher-order structures of the Hdr and Fmd complexes could be common in diverse methanogenic archaea. The structures also provided new insight into the fine-tuned mechanism of FBEB. Corresponding author Bonnie Murphy explains:  The method of cryo-EM allows us to use image classification to solve structures of different conformational states present within the same sample. In this case, we found that two different conformational states of the complex differed by a large rotation of a portion we are calling the  mobile arm . By rotating between these two states, the complex controls electron flow into and out of the FBEB site . Together, these findings help us to understand how the energy metabolism of methanogenic archaea is fine-tuned for efficiency: by controlling electron flow into and out of FBEB and by allowing direct transfer of high-energy electrons for CO2 fixation. This knowledge will be helpful in designing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and may allow wider application of electron bifurcation in biotechnology.ReferenceWatanabe T et al.

The findings are detailed in the journal Sports Medicine, in one of the marquee papers to emerge from the NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium. The study's lead researcher, Steve Broglio, director of the University of Michigan Concussion Center, is on the CARE Consortium leadership team and leads the CARE clinical study core. ""Normal return-to-play time was previously set at 14 days meaning 50% of people recovered in that time. Our paper suggests that 28 days more fully encapsulates the recovery process. At that point, 85% of people have returned to play,"" Broglio said.The study found that though median recovery times were consistent with the previously suggested 14 days, it was not until one month post-injury that most athletes were cleared for unrestricted sport participation. This doesn't mean that universities must revise their return to play protocols.  ""The RTP protocols are driven by clinical presentation (symptoms), not time, so they don't need to be revised,"" Broglio said.  Rather, coaches, parents and athletes should reframe their expectations for return to play, in part to avoid stigmatizing concussed athletes who take longer than 14 days to recover, he said. Reframing the normal recovery time to 28 days helps eliminate unintentional social pressure from teammates, coaches or parents who hope to see their player back on the field. If a concussed athlete takes longer than 14 days or up to a month, that's completely normal, he said.There wasn't much variation in recovery times among study subgroups, with various factors altering recovery by only up to two days. The total return-to-play duration was shorter with ADHD medication usage, males and greater assessment frequency. Those with greater initial post-injury symptom severity, practice/training-related injuries and three or more prior concussions had longer recoveries. Concussion management recommendations are outlined every four years by the Concussion in Sport Group, an international body that reviews the medical literature and develops guidelines on clinical care. This paper and others resulting from the CARE Consortium will likely be taken into consideration when the group meets next year, said Broglio, who is also a member of CISG.Despite increased research in concussion over the previous decade, the trajectory of concussion recovery times across diverse populations of athletes has remained poorly defined, because most sport concussion research centered on male athletes in collision sports, or on female soccer players, Broglio said. The current study included 34,709 male and female athletes from 30 colleges and universities more than 1,700 of whom were concussed while participating in 22 sports. Concussed male athletes most commonly played football (54.7%), soccer (10.7%), basketball (6.8%) and wrestling (6.4%), while concussed female athletes most commonly played soccer (23.4%), volleyball (14%), basketball (12.9%) and lacrosse (8.4%). Broglio said male and female athletes took about the same amount of time to recover from concussion, give or take a day. Concussion education and treatment has improved dramatically in the last two decades, he said. ""Back when I started in concussion research 20 years ago, we'd manage these injuries with a light switch. We'd ask, 'Do you have symptoms?' and if the answer was no, the athlete was put back on the field. Gone are the days when concussed athletes are put back in the same day,"" Broglio said. ""Now, we can think of it as a dial, where weslowly progress people back into the sport. Once a player is asymptomatic, it can still take some time. We have to respect the injury and respect the recovery process.""Reference: Broglio SP, McAllister T, Katz BP, et al.

A complete change over to this new method of food freezing worldwide could cut energy use by as much as 6.5 billion kilowatt-hours each year while reducing the carbon emissions that go along with generating that power by 4.6 billion kg, the equivalent of removing roughly one million cars from roads,  said ARS research food technologist Cristina Bilbao-Sainz. She is with the Healthy Processed Foods Research Unit, part of ARS s Western Regional Research Center (WRRC) in Albany.  T hese savings could be achieved without requiring any significant changes in current frozen food manufacturing equipment and infrastructure, if food manufacturers adopt this concept,  Bilbao-Sainz added. The new freezing method, called isochoric freezing, works by storing foods in a sealed, rigid container typically made of hard plastic or metal completely filled with a liquid such as water. Unlike conventional freezing in which the food is exposed to the air and freezes solid at temperatures below 32 degrees F, isochoric freezing preserves food without turning it to solid ice. As long as the food stays immersed in the liquid portion, it is protected from ice crystallization, which is the main threat to food quality.  Energy savings come from not having to freeze foods completely solid, which uses a huge amount of energy, plus there is no need to resort to energy-intensive cold storage protocols such as quick freezing to avoid ice crystal formation,  Bilbao-Sainz said. Isochoric freezing also allows for higher quality storage of fresh foods such as tomatoes, sweet cherries and potatoes that are otherwise difficult to preserve with conventional freezing. Another benefit of isochoric freezing is that it also kills microbial contaminants during processing.  The entire food production chain could use isochoric freezing everyone from growers to food processors, product producers to wholesalers, to retailers. The process will even work in a person s freezer at home after they purchase a product all without requiring any major investments in new equipment,  said WRRC center director Tara McHugh, co-leader of this study.  With all of the many potential benefits, if this innovative concept catches on, it could be the next revolution in freezing foods.  UC-Berkeley biomedical engineer Boris Rubinsky, co-leader of this project, first developed the isochoric freezing method to cryopreserve tissues and organs for transplants. Since then, ARS and UC-Berkeley have applied for a joint patent for applying isochoric freezing to preserving food. The research team is now developing the best applications for this technology in the frozen foods industry, especially scaling up the technology to an industrial level. They also are seeking commercial partners to help transfer the technology to the commercial sector. UC-Berkeley mechanical engineer Matthew Powell-Palm, one of the lead authors of the study paper, noted that  isochoric freezing is a cross-cutting technology with promising applications in not only the food industry, but in medicine, biology, even space travel.  WRRC has also been designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in 2002 by the American Chemical Society for developing the Time-Temperature Tolerance studies, which made possible the production of stable, safe and high quality frozen food, revolutionizing the industry in the 1950s.

New work from the Center for Mind and Brain at the University of California, Davis, shows that we can solve abstract problems in the same way that we can find a novel route between two known locations   by using an internal cognitive map. The work is published Aug. 31 in the journal Nature Neuroscience.Humans and animals have a great ability to solve novel problems by generalizing from existing knowledge and inferring new solutions from limited data. This is much harder to achieve with artificial intelligence.Animals (including humans) navigate by creating a representative map of the outside world in their head as they move around. Once we know two locations are close to each other, we can infer that there is a shortcut between them even if we haven t been there. These maps make use of a network of  grid cells  and  place cells  in parts of the brain.In earlier work, Professor Erie Boorman, postdoctoral researcher Seongmin (Alex) Park, Douglas Miller and colleagues showed that human volunteers could construct a similar cognitive map for abstract information. The volunteers were given limited information about people in a two-dimensional social network, ranked by relative competence and popularity. The researchers found that the volunteers could mentally reconstruct this network, represented as a grid, without seeing the original.The new work takes the research further by testing if people can actually use such a map to find the answers to novel problems.

Stanley Qi, assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, likes that analogy, but he thinks it s time to reimagine CRISPR as a Swiss Army knife. CRISPR can be as simple as a cutter, or more advanced as a regulator, an editor, a labeler or imager. Many applications are emerging from this exciting field,  said Qi, who is also an assistant professor of chemical and systems biology in the Stanford School of Medicine and a Stanford ChEM-H institute scholar.The many different CRISPR systems in use or being clinically tested for gene therapy of diseases in the eye, liver and brain, however, remain limited in their scope because they all suffer from the same flaw: they re too large and, therefore, too hard to deliver into cells, tissues or living organisms.In a paper published in Molecular Cell, Qi and his collaborators announce what they believe is a major step forward for CRISPR: An efficient, multi-purpose, mini CRISPR system. Whereas the commonly used CRISPR systems   with names like Cas9 and Cas12a denoting various versions of CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins   are made of about 1000 to 1500 amino acids, their  CasMINI  has 529.The researchers confirmed in experiments that CasMINI could delete, activate and edit genetic code just like its beefier counterparts. Its smaller size means it should be easier to deliver into human cells and the human body, making it a potential tool for treating diverse ailments, including eye disease, organ degeneration and genetic diseases generally.Persistent effortTo make the system as small as possible, the researchers decided to start with the CRISPR protein Cas12f (also known as Cas14), because it contains only about 400 to 700 amino acids. However, like other CRISPR proteins, Cas12f naturally originates from Archaea   single-celled organisms   which means it is not well-suited to mammalian cells, let alone human cells or bodies. Only a few CRISPR proteins are known to work in mammalian cells without modification. Unfortunately, CAS12f is not one of them. This makes it an enticing challenge for bioengineers like Qi. We thought,  Okay, millions of years of evolution have not been able to turn this CRISPR system into something that functions in the human body. Can we change that in just one or two years?  said Qi.  To my knowledge, we have, for the first time, turned a nonworking CRISPR into a working one. Indeed, Xiaoshu Xu, a postdoctoral scholar in the Qi lab and lead author of the paper, saw no activity of the natural Cas12f in human cells. Xu and Qi hypothesized that the issue was that human genome DNA is more complicated and less accessible than microbial DNA, making it hard for Cas12f to find its target in cells. By looking at the computationally predicted structure of the Cas12f system, she carefully chose about 40 mutations in the protein that could potentially bypass this limitation and established a pipeline for testing many protein variants at a time. A working variant would, in theory, turn a human cell green by activating green fluorescent protein (GFP) in its genome. At first, this system did not work at all for a year,  Xu said.  But after iterations of bioengineering, we saw some engineered proteins start to turn on, like magic. It made us really appreciate the power of synthetic biology and bioengineering. The first successful results were modest, but they excited Xu and encouraged her to push forward because it meant the system worked. Over many additional iterations, she was able to further improve the protein s performance.  We started with seeing only two cells showing a green signal, and now after engineering, almost every cell is green under the microscope,  Xu said. At some moment, I had to stop her,  recalled Qi.  I said  That s good for now. You ve made a pretty good system. We should think about how this molecule can be used for applications. In addition to protein engineering, the researchers also engineered the RNA that guides the Cas protein to its target DNA. Modifications to both components were crucial to making the CasMINI system work in human cells. They tested CasMINI s ability to delete and edit genes in lab-based human cells, including genes related to HIV infection, anti-tumor immune response and anemia. It worked on almost every gene they tested, with robust responses in several.Opening the doorThe researchers have already begun assembling collaborations with other scientists to pursue gene therapies. They are also interested in how they could contribute to advances in RNA technologies   like what has been used to develop the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines   where size can also be a limiting factor. This ability to engineer these systems has been desired in the field since the early days of CRISPR, and I feel like we did our part to move toward that reality,  said Qi.  And this engineering approach can be so broadly helpful. That s what excites me   opening the door on new possibilities. Reference: Xu X, Chemparathy A, Zeng L, et al.

High body mass index (BMI), an indicator of obesity, combined with exposure to the highest levels of toxins from the attack on the World Trade Center, were the two greatest risk factors for lowered lung function, according to the study authors. After two decades of research analyzing thousands of first responders, a new investigation led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine identified a cluster of five factors that predicted lung disease in these patients. Along with excess body fat, the combination of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and increased levels of sugar and cholesterol in the blood are components of so-called metabolic syndrome, a group of medical issues known to raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Adjusting at least one of these factors, the study investigators found, can greatly lower firefighters  risk of developing lung disease within 5 years, even 20 years after toxic exposures at Ground Zero. For example, for a male firefighter of average height, a 7-pound weight loss could decrease his risk for lung injury by 20 percent.  Our findings should reassure World Trade Center first responders that there are steps they can take to protect their lungs even decades after exposure,  says study co-lead author Sophia Kwon, DO, MPH. Dr. Kwon is a fellow in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at NYU Langone Health. In work presented earlier this year on 100 overweight 9/11 firefighters, the team found that placing patients on a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet featuring unrefined grains, olive oil, fruits, and fish reduced their risk of lung disease. Those following the regimen for 6 months lost nearly 2 BMI points (from an average BMI of about 33 to an average of 31) and had fewer signs of lung disease than they had reported before the study period.  These results offer firefighters a concrete way to lose weight and achieve the lung health benefits predicted by our risk model,  says study co-lead author George Crowley, BA, a predoctoral fellow at NYU Langone. Experts had previously understood that first responders who developed metabolic syndrome shortly after 9/11 were more likely to have higher rates of asthma. However, lung injury risks for a firefighter whose metabolic syndrome instead appeared later in life remained unclear until now. The new study, published online September 2 in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, is part of what is likely the longest-running and most thorough exploration of the impact of metabolic syndrome on lung injury in 9/11 firefighters, according to the study authors. In addition, the investigation is the first to date to quantify how adjusting one or more of these risk factors changes lung disease risk. For the investigation, the research team analyzed 20 years of data from more than 5,700 firefighters active on 9/11, of whom 1,475 later developed lung disease. Along with BMI, the data collected included smoking history and whether they had served at the World Trade Center in early morning when pollutant exposure was at its peak.  The lessons from our investigation can be applied not only to firefighters but to the millions of city dwellers exposed to air pollution on a daily basis,  says study senior author and pulmonologist Anna Nolan, MD.  They should be aware that while their environment poses real health risks, they may still minimize their risk of lung disease even if they cannot change their exposure.  Dr. Nolan, a professor in the Department of Medicine and Department of Environmental Medicine at NYU Langone, cautions that while promising, the Mediterranean diet investigation only examined a small, specific group. As a result, the research team next plans to expand the study to determine whether the diet could benefit a more diverse population who have been similarly exposed to urban pollutants. They also plan to explore how metabolic syndrome may affect other measures of lung function like asthma, says Dr. Nolan.ReferenceKwon S, Lee M, Crowley G, et al.

Their analysis revealed four compounds, Pt-tpy, Pt-ttpy, Pt-vpym and Pt-cpym, that induce a specific loss of a linear but not a circular HAC.Increased CIN after treatment by these compounds correlates with the induction of double-stranded breaks predominantly localized at telomeres and reflecting telomere-associated DNA damage.These terpyridine platinum-derived G4 ligands are promising compounds for cancer treatment.Dr. Vladimir Larionov and Dr. Natalay Kouprina both from The National Institutes of Health said, ""Normal human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes.""Telomerase/telomere-targeting therapy is considered to be a potentially promising approach for cancer treatment because even transient telomere dysfunction can induce chromosomal instability in human cells.The enzyme telomerase elongates telomeres and maintains a telomere length equilibrium that prevents telomeres from becoming critically short.In particular, formation of G4s at telomeres could impede telomerase recognition and inhibit telomere elongation leading to telomere shortening.Thus, telomeres are promising targets for discovery of ligands that stabilize G4s at telomeres, thereby perturbing telomere maintenance and leading to genomic instability.The authors found that treatment of cancer cells with either Pt-cpym, Pt-vpym, Pt-ttpy or Pt-tpy induces telomere dysfunction leading to high levels of chromosome instability.Reference: Petrov N, Lee H-S, Liskovykh M, et al.

The findings were published in the journal Nature Biotechnology.Patients have differing immune responses that lead to COVID-19 severity outcomes ranging from asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to death. After examining the blood samples from nearly 200 COVID-19 patients, researchers have uncovered underlying metabolic changes that regulate how immune cells react to the disease. These changes are associated with disease severity and could be used to predict patient survival.  We know that there are a range of immune responses to COVID-19, and the biological processes underlying those responses are not well understood,  said co-first author Jihoon Lee, a graduate student at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.  We analyzed thousands of biological markers linked to metabolic pathways that underlie the immune system and found some clues as to what immune-metabolic changes may be pivotal in severe disease. Our hope is that these observations of immune function will help others piece together the body s response to COVID-19. The deeper understanding gained here may eventually lead to better therapies that can more precisely target the most problematic immune or metabolic changes.  The researchers collected 374 blood samples   two draws per patient during the first week after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection   and analyzed their plasma and single immune cells. The analysis included 1,387 genes involved in metabolic pathways and 1,050 plasma metabolites.In plasma samples, the team found that increased COVID-19 severity is associated with metabolite alterations, suggesting increased immune-related activity. Furthermore, through single-cell sequencing, researchers found that each major immune cell type has a distinct metabolic signature.  We have found metabolic reprogramming that is highly specific to individual immune cell classes (e.g.  killer  CD8+ T cells,  helper  CD4+ T cells, antibody-secreting B cells, etc.) and even cell subtypes, and the complex metabolic reprogramming of the immune system is associated with the plasma global metabolome and are predictive of disease severity and even patient death,  said co-first and co-corresponding author Dr. Yapeng Su, a research scientist at ISB.  Such deep and clinically relevant insights on sophisticated metabolic reprogramming within our heterogeneous immune systems are otherwise impossible to gain without advanced single-cell multi-omic analysis.   This work provides significant insights for developing more effective treatments against COVID-19. It also represents a major technological hurdle,  said Dr. Jim Heath, president and professor of ISB and co-corresponding author on the paper.  Many of the data sets that are collected from these patients tend to measure very different aspects of the disease, and are analyzed in isolation. Of course, one would like these different views to contribute to an overall picture of the patient. The approach described here allows for the sum of the different data sets to be much greater than the parts, and provides for a much richer interpretation of the disease.

It also found that employees with asthma brought on by office work left their jobs and, if employers did not make changes to tackle the problem, this was more common. Researchers say that their work provides another reason for allowing home working to continue beyond COVID-19 restrictions, to benefit office workers  health and help businesses retain staff. The study was presented by Dr Christopher Huntley, from Birmingham Regional Occupational Lung Disease Service at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. He said:  Any work environment can induce occupational asthma if it harbours a respiratory sensitiser. This is a substance that triggers an irreversible allergic reaction, such as paint spray or dust. We usually think of an office as a safe environment, so it s possible that when asthma is diagnosed in office workers, occupational causes may be overlooked. As a result, there has been very little research on this issue.  However, we have been diagnosing increasing cases of occupational asthma in patients who work in office environments, as well as detecting clusters of cases in specific offices.  Dr Huntley and his colleagues studied the cases of 47 office workers with occupational asthma that had been reported to the Birmingham Regional Occupational Lung Disease Service. The majority had had their asthma confirmed by serial peak flow monitoring. This measures the fastest rate patients can breathe air out of their lungs. Seventeen of the patients had also been tested and found to have lungs that react strongly to a test for sensitive airways. The researchers identified three main categories that were causes of occupational asthma in the office workers. These were: triggers found inside the office (printer toner, floor tile adhesive, mould and cleaning products), triggers coming from the office ventilation system (mould in air conditioning and ventilation shafts that had been installed incorrectly) and triggers from the office s immediate environment (nearby workshops, paint and vehicle fumes). They also investigated whether employers made any adjustments to support office workers with occupational asthma and what workers did as a result. Their most striking finding was that when employers failed to act, workers were 100 times more likely to quit their job. Dr Huntley said:  Although we only looked at the patients who were referred to our service and this is a relatively small study, it is still one of the largest studies reporting occupational asthma in office workers. We discovered some key causes to be aware of in an office environment, but there will certainly be others.  If a worker develops occupational asthma, workplace adjustments can and should be made to improve asthma symptoms and help retain staff.  Dr Huntley says that there have been fewer new referrals for patients with occupational asthma during COVID-19 restrictions and that those already suffering with occupational asthma have seen improvements while working from home. He adds:  Working from home has been useful for patients in both establishing their diagnosis and as a form of non-pharmacological treatment. Allowing workers with occupational asthma to continue working from home may help keep office workers in their jobs as they require fewer sick days.  Arzu Yorganc o lu, who was not involved in the study, is Chair of the European Respiratory Society Advocacy Council and Professor in Pulmonology at Celal Bayar University, Turkey. She said:  Because we tend to think of office environments as relatively safe, compared with other occupational settings where exposure to pollutants may occur, it is likely that there are more patients out there with undiagnosed office work-related asthma.  For office workers with asthma who experience an unexplained deterioration in their symptoms, this study highlights the importance of identifying and removing any potential occupational triggers. Where we see clusters of work-related asthma in offices it is vital to investigate the underlying cause, as the causes may be surprising. ReferenceHuntley C. et al.

This study was conducted by an international team led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and describes for the first time three molecular subtypes of lung cancer in people who have never smoked.These insights will help unlock the mystery of how lung cancer arises in people who have no history of smoking and may guide the development of more precise clinical treatments. The findings were published September 6, 2021, in Nature Genetics. What we re seeing is that there are different subtypes of lung cancer in never smokers that have distinct molecular characteristics and evolutionary processes,  said epidemiologist Maria Teresa Landi, M.D., Ph.D., of the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch in NCI s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, who led the study, which was done in collaboration with researchers at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, another part of NIH, and other institutions.  In the future we may be able to have different treatments based on these subtypes. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Every year, more than 2 million people around the world are diagnosed with the disease. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of tobacco smoking, but 10% to 20% of people who develop lung cancer have never smoked. Lung cancer in never smokers occurs more frequently in women and at an earlier age than lung cancer in smokers.Environmental risk factors, such as exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, radon, air pollution, and asbestos, or having had previous lung diseases, may explain some lung cancers among never smokers, but scientists still don t know what causes the majority of these cancers.In this large epidemiologic study, the researchers used whole-genome sequencing to characterize the genomic changes in tumor tissue and matched normal tissue from 232 never smokers, predominantly of European descent, who had been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. The tumors included 189 adenocarcinomas (the most common type of lung cancer), 36 carcinoids, and seven other tumors of various types. The patients had not yet undergone treatment for their cancer.The researchers combed the tumor genomes for mutational signatures, which are patterns of mutations associated with specific mutational processes, such as damage from natural activities in the body (for example, faulty DNA repair or oxidative stress) or from exposure to carcinogens. Mutational signatures act like a tumor s archive of activities that led up to the accumulation of mutations, providing clues into what caused the cancer to develop. A catalogue of known mutational signatures now exists, although some signatures have no known cause. In this study, the researchers discovered that a majority of the tumor genomes of never smokers bore mutational signatures associated with damage from endogenous processes, that is, natural processes that happen inside the body.As expected, because the study was limited to never smokers, the researchers did not find any mutational signatures that have previously been associated with direct exposure to tobacco smoking. Nor did they find those signatures among the 62 patients who had been exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. However, Dr. Landi cautioned that the sample size was small and the level of exposure highly variable. We need a larger sample size with detailed information on exposure to really study the impact of secondhand tobacco smoking on the development of lung cancer in never smokers,  Dr. Landi said.The genomic analyses also revealed three novel subtypes of lung cancer in never smokers, to which the researchers assigned musical names based on the level of  noise  (that is, the number of genomic changes) in the tumors. The predominant  piano  subtype had the fewest mutations; it appeared to be associated with the activation of progenitor cells, which are involved in the creation of new cells. This subtype of tumor grows extremely slowly, over many years, and is difficult to treat because it can have many different driver mutations. The  mezzo-forte  subtype had specific chromosomal changes as well as mutations in the growth factor receptor gene EGFR, which is commonly altered in lung cancer, and exhibited faster tumor growth. The  forte  subtype exhibited whole-genome doubling, a genomic change that is often seen in lung cancers in smokers. This subtype of tumor also grows quickly. We re starting to distinguish subtypes that could potentially have different approaches for prevention and treatment,  said Dr. Landi. For example, the slow-growing piano subtype could give clinicians a window of opportunity to detect these tumors earlier when they are less difficult to treat. In contrast, the mezzo-forte and forte subtypes have only a few major driver mutations, suggesting that these tumors could be identified by a single biopsy and could benefit from targeted treatments, she said.A future direction of this research will be to study people of different ethnic backgrounds and geographic locations, and whose exposure history to lung cancer risk factors is well described. We re at the beginning of understanding how these tumors evolve,  Dr. Landi said. This analysis shows that there is heterogeneity, or diversity, in lung cancers in never smokers. Stephen J. Chanock, M.D., director of NCI s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, noted,  We expect this detective-style investigation of genomic tumor characteristics to unlock new avenues of discovery for multiple cancer types.

The synthetic structures are built to resemble naturally occurring extracellular vesicles (EV) that play a fundamental role in communication between cells during various processes in our body. The scientists uncovered key mechanisms to regulate and aid wound healing and the formation of new blood vessels. For this, they designed and built programmable fully synthetic EVs from scratch rather than isolating natural EVs from cells. Inspired by the function of their natural blue prints, the scientists successfully demonstrate for the first time that fully synthetic exosomes with therapeutic functionality can be constructed.A well-working communication between cells is fundamental for multicellular organism such as ourselves. Almost all processes in our body require a coordinated interaction between cells as they form tissues and organs or, for example, work together during immune responses. Wound healing or the formation of new blood vessels also requires extensive cell-cell-signaling to ensure coordinated tissue regeneration. For this, cells in the skin apply several mechanisms to communicate with each other. One of those are extracellular vesicles (EVs). They are small droplets or compartments that cells can load with different molecules and release to transfer ""information."" Upon binding to other cells or uptake by those, they release that information. However, little is known about the concrete mechanisms and the complex signaling processes working behind extracellular vesicle communication. This is also the major limiting factor for their therapeutic application.Fully synthetic extracellular vesicles tweak the systemTo develop a better understanding of EVs, scientists at the MPIMR and collaborators chose a bottom-up synthetic biology approach. Within test tubes, they designed and assembled fully synthetic extracellular vesicles to precisely mimic their natural role model in form and function. By this, they aimed for a better, more systematic assessment of their role during wound healing and to understand the relevance and function of every single component within the vesicles. Their bottom-up approach, using lipid droplets, enabled to fine-tune the functionalities of the EVs and create a programmable EV technology. ""We can potentially create synthetic vesicles with various kinds of characteristics that is the beauty of the bottom-up approach. It gives us the chance to copy, tune and improve natural structures for different purposes,"" says Oskar Staufer, first author and postdoctoral researcher in the Cellular Biophysics Department at the MPIMR.Therapeutic use of synthetic EVs during wound healingTo demonstrate the functionality of the synthetic EVs during wound healing processes, the researchers studied the healing behavior of human donor skin cultured in the lab. When they treated wounds in these skins with their synthetic exosomes, they could show a much faster healing and the wounds closed faster. A similar observation was made when testing the synthetic exosomes  ability to improve the formation of new blood vessels, another process that is extremely relevant in several therapeutic contexts such as tissue regeneration after surgery and cardiac damage. By the digging deeper into the mechanism that act within the cells treated with the synthetic EVs, the scientists were also able to determine crucial molecules within the EVs that are responsible for triggering the therapeutic effects. Identifying the key components of the EVs is a key advance that in future might enable engineering individually adjustable vesicles of therapeutic value for the treatment of many diseases like cancer, immune-disorders or neurodegenerative diseases.""Exosomes have raised high hopes in biomedicine for more than 20 years now. With this new technology in hands, we are now able to synthetize exosomes with high purity on a therapeutic scale. This overcomes some of the major limitations that have impeded the application of exosomes for therapy and could lead us to harness the power of extracellular vesicle communication. Moreover, as we are working with very defined vesicle systems, we are now able to study the fundamental functions of EV in a very systematic way.""Reference: Staufer O, Dietrich F, Rimal R, et al.

The research, led by scientists from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) s Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) and Duke-NUS Medical School, published in the Annals of Neurology, offers a new way to study how the degenerative brain disease progresses and explore possible new treatments.Parkinson s disease is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting three in 1,000 Singaporeans aged 50 years and above. Worldwide, neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability, and Parkinson s disease is the fastest growing disorder. Prior research has mostly relied on mice, which do not reproduce all major pathological features seen in patients. Recreating models of Parkinson s disease in animal models is hard as these do not show the progressive and selective loss of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, a major feature of Parkinson s disease,  said Professor Ng Huck Hui, Senior Group Leader at GIS, A*STAR, who is a senior co-author of the study.  Another limitation is that experimental mouse models of Parkinson s disease do not develop characteristic clumps of proteins called Lewy bodies, which are often seen in the brain cells of people with Parkinson s disease and a type of progressive dementia known as Lewy body dementia. The team decided to turn to human mini-brains that they created previously. We called these  human midbrain-like organoids ,  said first author Dr Junghyun Jo, previously a Research Fellow at GIS and now a Principal Investigator at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University.  They are essentially three-dimensional, multicellular, in vitro tissue constructs that mimic the human midbrain. The small pea-sized human midbrain-like organoids are grown from human stem cells into a bundle of neurons and other cells found in the brain. The organoids enable scientists to study how the human brain develops and communicates. These experiments are the first to recreate the distinctive features of Parkinson s disease that we see only in human patients,  said Associate Professor Hyunsoo Shawn Je, a senior co-author from the Neuroscience and Behavioural Disorders Programme at Duke-NUS.  We have created a new model of the pathology involved, which will allow us to track how the disease develops and how it might be slowed down or stopped. By manipulating the DNA of the starting stem cells to match genetic risk factors found in patients with Parkinson s disease, the study scientists were able to grow organoids with neurons that showed both Lewy bodies and the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons. It s a major challenge to extend healthy living years in an ageing global population, whose physical and cognitive performance often declines due to neurodegenerative disorders,  said Professor Tan Eng King, Deputy Medical Director, Academic Affairs, at NNI, a senior co-author of the study.  This discovery provides insights and a  humanised  disease model that can facilitate drug testing against Parkinson s disease and dementia. Our organoid model with a genetic mutation on the GBA gene is also highly relevant as we have several of these genetic mutation carriers locally. The organoid system will enable research into Parkinson s disease and other conditions not possible with current animal models. The team is already using organoids to investigate why and how Lewy bodies form in human brain cells, and screen drugs that can potentially stop disease progression.Reference: Jo J, Yang L, Tran H, et al.

The work is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These results from our safety surveillance are reassuring,  said lead author Nicola Klein, MD, PhD, director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center and principal investigator of the Vaccine Safety Datalink s COVID-19 rapid cycle analysis. The world is relying on safe and effective vaccines to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Vaccine Safety Datalink is ideally suited to carry out this important surveillance and we will continue to monitor the safety of all vaccines that protect against COVID-19,  added Dr. Klein, who is also a senior research scientist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research.The study reported findings from mid-December 2020 through June 26, 2021. Some of the early findings had been summarized previously and reported at public meetings of the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, though the JAMA article is the VSD s first comprehensive report of its safety surveillance of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.The analyses compared specific health events among all COVID-19 mRNA-vaccinated people during the first 3 weeks after inoculation with health events among similar types of patients during the 3 to 6 weeks after mRNA vaccination. The total number of people evaluated was 6.2 million for the first dose of either mRNA vaccine and 5.7 million for the second dose.The design is meant to compare patients who are as similar to one another as possible to reduce the number of factors that could complicate the results. The authors added a comparison group of unvaccinated patients in a supplemental analysis.The researchers examined 23 potential health effects, chosen because they had been included in previous vaccine studies, were of particular concern as an effect of COVID-19, were noted during the COVID-19 clinical trials, or were added after public health officials reported increased cases among vaccinated people. Outcomes tracked included neurological disorders such as encephalitis and myelitis, seizures, and Guillain-Barr  syndrome; cardiovascular problems such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism; and others such as Bell s palsy, appendicitis, anaphylaxis, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome.Patient medical records were searched electronically and analysts carried out chart reviews of specific health outcomes to verify the medical problem and to assess whether it started before or after vaccination.Vaccine Safety Datalink researchers then applied statistical analysis to determine whether the number of incidents was above a certain threshold, or  signal.  They concluded that none of the target health outcomes reached the signal, though for some outcomes the findings were less precise because of small numbers of cases. The authors said VSD safety surveillance is ongoing, which will increase the precision of estimates for those outcomes.The study authors highlighted their findings about cases of confirmed myocarditis and pericarditis among young individuals, as that has become an outcome of concern. The VSD study identified 34 such cases in patients 12 to 39 years old; 85% of them were male and 82% hospitalized (for a median of 1 day), and nearly all recovered by the time the chart review took place. The authors calculated that among patients 12 to 39 years old, there is a risk of 6.3 additional myocarditis cases per million doses during the first week after vaccination. Other research has calculated a significantly higher risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 than from the vaccine. The results of this study are a great example of how seriously CDC takes vaccine safety, and how thorough and transparent we are in our safety monitoring efforts,  said Tom Shimabukuro, MD, leading vaccine safety for the COVID-19 response and the deputy director of CDC s Immunization Safety Office.  It is our top priority to do the science and communicate quickly and clearly with healthcare providers and the public, as COVID-19 vaccines continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Getting vaccinated remains the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against a virus that has taken millions of lives. The VSD s rapid-cycle analysis for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines will continue tracking newly vaccinated patients for at least 2 years. The VSD, established in 1990 and led by the CDC, Kaiser Permanente, and other health care systems, is the nation s premier active surveillance system for vaccine safety.Reference: Klein NP, Lewis N, Goddard K, et al.

A spike in dopamine could come be from eating pizza, dancing, shopping, and sex. But it can also come from drugs and lead to substance abuse.In search of ways of treating addiction and psychiatric illness, researchers are looking for pathways beyond dopamine that could play a key role in rewards and reinforcement.In a paper published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from the Bruchas Lab at the University of Washington School of Medicine pushed the science forward on our reward pathways and found there is another pathway beyond dopamine. The Bruchas Lab is expanding knowledge of the inner workings of the brain and identifying treatments for psychiatric diseases. This study opens new avenues to understanding reward circuitry that might be altered in abuse of nicotine, opiates, or other drugs as well as neuropsychiatric diseases that affect reward processing including depression,  said corresponding author Dr. Michael Bruchas, professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine who runs the Bruchas Lab. The Bruchas Lab is expanding knowledge of the inner workings of the brain and identifying treatments for psychiatric diseases.In this study, researchers found that approximately 30% of cells in the VTA are GABA neurons. VTA GABA neurons have increasingly been recognized as players in reward and aversion, as well as potential targets for the treatment of addiction, depression, and other stress-linked disorders. Neurons are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. What we found are unique GABAergic cells that project broadly to the nucleus accumbens, but projections only to a specific portion contribute to reward reinforcement,  said co-lead author Raajaram Gowrishankar, a postdoctoral scholar working in the Bruchas Lab and the Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction, Pain and Emotion.In both male and female mice, researchers showed that long-range GABA neurons from the VTA to the ventral, but not the dorsal, nucleus accumben shell are engaged in reward and reinforcement behavior. They showed that this GABAergic projection inhibit cholinergic interneurons -- key players in reward-related learning. As the researchers wrote: These findings  further our understanding of neuronal circuits that are directly implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and addiction. Co-lead author Ream Al-Hasani with the Center for Clinical Pharmacology and Washington University likened the findings to building with Legos and figuring out how one piece connects to another.Each piece of the puzzle can take multiple years.Gowrishankar said the findings are allowing scientists to understand subregions of the brain and to visualize how specific neuromodulators are released during reward processing.In science terms, the researchers are able to highlight heterogeneity in the brain -- or differences in the brain. It s really important that we don t think of structures in the brain as monolithic,  said Gowrishankar.  There s lots of little nuance in brain. How plastic it is. How it s wired. This finding is showing one way how differences can play out. Reference: Al-Hasani R, Gowrishankar R, Schmitz GP, et al.

Reminiscent of the plasticity of connections in the human brain, the device can be reconfigured on the fly for different computational tasks by simply changing applied voltages. Furthermore, like nerve cells can store memories, the same device can also retain information for future retrieval and processing. The brain has the remarkable ability to change its wiring around by making and breaking connections between nerve cells. Achieving something comparable in a physical system has been extremely challenging,  said Dr. R. Stanley Williams, professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.  We have now created a molecular device with dramatic reconfigurability, which is achieved not by changing physical connections like in the brain, but by reprogramming its logic. Dr. T. Venkatesan, director of the Center for Quantum Research and Technology (CQRT) at the University of Oklahoma, Scientific Affiliate at National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, and adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering at the National University of Singapore, added that their molecular device might in the future help design next-generation processing chips with enhanced computational power and speed, but consuming significantly reduced energy.Whether it is the familiar laptop or a sophisticated supercomputer, digital technologies face a common nemesis, the von Neumann bottleneck. This delay in computational processing is a consequence of current computer architectures, wherein the memory, containing data and programs, is physically separated from the processor. As a result, computers spend a significant amount of time shuttling information between the two systems, causing the bottleneck. Also, despite extremely fast processor speeds, these units can be idling for extended amounts of time during periods of information exchange.As an alternative to conventional electronic parts used for designing memory units and processors, devices called memristors offer a way to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck. Memristors, such as those made of niobium dioxide and vanadium dioxide, transition from being an insulator to a conductor at a set temperature. This property gives these types of memristors the ability to perform computations and store data.However, despite their many advantages, these metal oxide memristors are made of rare-earth elements and can operate only in restrictive temperature regimes. Hence, there has been an ongoing search for promising organic molecules that can perform a comparable memristive function, said Williams.Dr. Sreebrata Goswami, a professor at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, designed the material used in this work. The compound has a central metal atom (iron) bound to three phenyl azo pyridine organic molecules called ligands. This behaves like an electron sponge that can absorb as many as six electrons reversibly, resulting in seven different redox states,  said Sreebrata.  The interconnectivity between these states is the key behind the reconfigurability shown in this work. Dr. Sreetosh Goswami, a researcher at the National University of Singapore, devised this project by creating a tiny electrical circuit consisting of a 40-nanometer layer of molecular film sandwiched between a layer of gold on top and gold-infused nanodisc and indium tin oxide at the bottom.On applying a negative voltage on the device, Sreetosh witnessed a current-voltage profile that was nothing like anyone had seen before. Unlike metal-oxide memristors that can switch from metal to insulator at only one fixed voltage, the organic molecular devices could switch back and forth from insulator to conductor at several discrete sequential voltages. So, if you think of the device as an on-off switch, as we were sweeping the voltage more negative, the device first switched from on to off, then off to on, then on to off and then back to on. I'll say that we were just blown out of our seat,  said Venkatesan.  We had to convince ourselves that what we were seeing was real. Sreetosh and Sreebrata investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the curious switching behavior using an imaging technique called Raman spectroscopy. In particular, they looked for spectral signatures in the vibrational motion of the organic molecule that could explain the multiple transitions. Their investigation revealed that sweeping the voltage negative triggered the ligands on the molecule to undergo a series of reduction, or electron-gaining, events that caused the molecule to transition between off state and on states.Next, to describe the extremely complex current-voltage profile of the molecular device mathematically, Williams deviated from the conventional approach of basic physics-based equations. Instead, he described the behavior of the molecules using a decision tree algorithm with  if-then-else  statements, a commonplace line of code in several computer programs, particularly digital games. Video games have a structure where you have a character that does something, and then something occurs as a result. And so, if you write that out in a computer algorithm, they are if-then-else statements,  said Williams.  Here, the molecule is switching from on to off as a consequence of applied voltage, and that s when I had the eureka moment to use decision trees to describe these devices, and it worked very well.  But the researchers went a step further to exploit these molecular devices to run programs for different real-world computational tasks. Sreetosh showed experimentally that their devices could perform fairly complex computations in a single time step and then be reprogrammed to perform another task in the next instant. It was quite extraordinary; our device was doing something like what the brain does, but in a very different way,  said Sreetosh.  When you're learning something new or when you're deciding, the brain can actually reconfigure and change physical wiring around. Similarly, we can logically reprogram or reconfigure our devices by giving them a different voltage pulse then they've seen before.  Venkatesan noted that it would take thousands of transistors to perform the same computational functions as one of their molecular devices with its different decision trees. Hence, he said their technology might first be used in handheld devices, like cell phones and sensors, and other applications where power is limited.Reference: Goswami S, Pramanick R, Patra A, et al.

In analyzing the atlas data further, the researchers discovered there are different types of melanocytes, including what appears to be the cell of origin for acral melanoma, a subtype of melanoma that mostly affects people of color. Researchers predict these discoveries will lead to more targeted treatments for melanoma. The findings were published today in the journal Nature Cell Biology.Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, originates in melanocytes, the cells that give color to the skin and protect it from the sun s rays. Melanocytes were thought to be interchangeable but lead author Rachel Belote, PhD, HCI postdoctoral fellow in the Judson-Torres Lab, says,  I noticed that not all melanocytes respond to signals from surrounding cells in the same way. If melanocytes from the same piece of skin respond differently to the same stimuli, this would mean there are actually different types of melanocytes. The research team began looking deeper into human melanocytes. They looked at melanocytes through different developmental stages, aging, anatomic locations, sexes, and skin tones.  While most studies have used melanocytes that were only similar to human, here the focus remained entirely on human melanocytes. Together, the researchers generated the first atlas, or map, of melanocytes across the human body and through stages of cell development. We also focused on single cell resolution, studying cells one at a time. It was the combination of several of these variables specifically studying human developmental stages at different anatomic locations with single cell resolution that permitted us to make the discoveries we did,  says Belote s mentor and senior author on the study, Robert Judson-Torres, PhD, HCI researcher and U of U assistant professor of dermatology and oncological sciences.One of those discoveries was a new melanocyte that appears to be the cell of origin for a specific subtype of melanoma called acral melanoma. Very few treatment options exist for this type of melanoma, which is the most common type in people with darker skin. This study really locks down that acral melanoma is its own thing,  says Judson-Torres.  Most of the history of exploring acral melanoma has treated it as a bit of an afterthought compared to the most common subtypes of melanoma that predominantly affect the white population.  Judson-Torres says the classic approach has been to first find treatments for the more common disease, then see if the treatment works on acral melanoma. This approach hasn t been particularly successful. We expect this study to change how acral melanoma is approached and studied, and we hope it will rapidly lead to acral-specific therapeutics,  he says.The study also revealed three more discoveries. The team found the specific genes associated with variations of skin tones in one single person, not related to sun exposure. The team identified genes that mark progressing melanomas that are less likely to respond to treatments. The team also discovered the genes that make human melanocytes unique. We confirmed there are different types of melanocytes that are not only associated with different biological features corresponding to specific regions of the skin but also give rise to different types of melanoma,  says Belote.The researchers are planning follow-up research, including developing acral melanoma-specific in vivo and in vitro models to begin screening acral-specific therapeutics.Reference: Belote RL, Le D, Maynard A, et al.

In the future, electrical stimulation may help people with psychiatric illness and direct brain injuries, such as stroke.However, studying how brain networks interact with each other is complicated. Brain networks can be explored by delivering brief pulses of electrical current in one area of a patient's brain while measuring voltage responses in other areas. In principle, one should be able to infer the structure of brain networks from these data. However, with real-world data, the problem is difficult because the recorded signals are complex, and a limited amount of measurements can be made.To make the problem manageable, Mayo Clinic researchers developed a set of paradigms, or viewpoints, that simplify comparisons between effects of electrical stimulation on the brain. Because a mathematical technique to characterize how assemblies of inputs converge in human brain regions did not exist in the scientific literature, the Mayo team collaborated with an international expert in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to develop a new type of algorithm called ""basis profile curve identification.""In a study published in PLOS Computational Biology, a patient with a brain tumor underwent placement of an electrocorticographic electrode array to locate seizures and map brain function before a tumor was removed. Every electrode interaction resulted in hundreds to thousands of time points to be studied using the new algorithm.""Our findings show that this new type of algorithm may help us understand which brain regions directly interact with one another, which in turn may help guide placement of electrodes for stimulating devices to treat network brain diseases,"" says Kai Miller, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon and first author of the study.

It also tracks patterns of how the states switch from one to the next. The  beta-hidden Markov model  therefore provides anesthesiologists, neuroscientists, and data scientists alike with a principled guide to how ketamine anesthesia affects the brain and what patients will experience.In parallel work the lab of senior author Emery N. Brown, an anesthesiologist at MGH and Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience at MIT, has developed statistical analyses to characterize brain activity under propofol anesthesia, but as the new study makes clear, ketamine produces entirely different effects. Efforts to better understand the drug and to improve patient outcomes therefore depend on having a ketamine-specific model. Now we have an extremely solid statistical stake in the ground regarding ketamine and its dynamics,  said Brown, a professor in MIT s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Institute for Medical Engineering & Science, as well as at Harvard Medical School.

Degeneration of the discs that cushion and support vertebrae, a common occurrence of aging, is a major contributor to low back pain. Although a widespread condition, few treatments are available. Now Jefferson s Makarand Risbud, PhD,  James J. Maguire Jr. Professor of Spine Research in orthopedic surgery, division director of orthopedic research and co-director of the cell biology and regenerative medicine graduate program, and colleagues have shown that treating mice with a drug cocktail that removes aging cells reduces disc degeneration. The findings, reported in Nature Communications on September 3rd, show how a novel approach to preventing age-related disc degeneration may pave the way for treating chronic back pain. Once intervertebral discs start to degenerate, there is very little regeneration that happens,  says Dr. Risbud.  But our results show that it is possible to mitigate the disc degeneration that happens with aging. Surgery or steroid injections are options to treat low back pain from disc degeneration, but the vast majority of patients do not meet criteria for surgery and epidural steroid injections do not work well most of the time. Prolonged use of strong painkillers prescribed for back pain, such as opioids, carry the risk of addiction.In collaboration with Brian Diekman, PhD, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Dr. Risbud and his team were looking for an effective and noninvasive way to treat back pain from disc degeneration that did not involve painkillers like opioids. Instead, they turned to a class of small molecules known as senolytics. These drugs target cells in the body that are in a process of age-related deterioration called senescence.With age, every tissue in the body accumulates senescent cells. Senescent cells secrete destructive enzymes and inflammatory proteins that affect nearby healthy cells. Senolytic drugs remove these deteriorating cells, leaving room for new cells to replace them. The idea is that removing senescent cells from a tissue will improve the tissue s function.Recent research has shown that to be the case. Two senolytic drugs, dasatinib and quercetin, have shown enough promise to treat scarring in lung tissue that they are now in clinical trials. But the lungs are very different than discs in the spine. Just because the drugs work in one tissue doesn t mean they will also work in another,  Dr. Risbud says.  Every tissue is different. To find out whether senolytics could improve aging-related disc degeneration, Emanuele Novais, an MD, PhD student in Dr. Risbud s lab and first-author of the new work, and colleagues gave young, middle-aged and elderly mice a cocktail of the senolytic drugs, dasatinib and quercetin, every week.The weekly injections mitigated disc generation, but not in the way that Dr. Risbud and his team had expected. They expected to see the largest effect in the oldest animals because these animals would have accumulated more senescent cells than younger mice. Instead, Dr. Risbud and colleagues found that treatment in younger animals had more benefit and actually had a protective effect.Young and middle-aged mice given the senolytic cocktail showed less disc degeneration and fewer senescent cells by the time they reached an advanced age compared to mice given a placebo. We anticipated that in tissues with a lot of senescence, removing the senescent cells would make a big difference, but it didn t,  Dr. Risbud said.  The therapy was most effective when we started treating the mice when those senescent cells were just beginning to emerge. Our findings show that if given early, senolytic drugs can actually slow disc degeneration,  says Dr. Risbud.  This is a novel preventive approachBut the mice needed a weekly injection from a relatively young age until they reached old age, a much longer time period than senolytic drugs have been given in other uses. The researchers however did not see any deleterious effects of long-term treatment. It is possible that people will have to take this for a long time for treatment to be effective, and our data show that the drugs were well-tolerated, at least in mice,  Dr. Risbud says.Altogether, the findings show that senolytic drugs ones already approved for use in clinical trials can mitigate disc degeneration that occurs with aging. This research paves the way for translating these studies first to a preclinical animal model and then to a clinical trial in humans,  says Dr. Risbud said.Reference: Novais EJ, Tran VA, Johnston SN, et al.

Comprehensive screening of organohalogen compounds in the livers of wild birds from Osaka, Japan using two-dimensional gas chromatography in combination with high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC GC HRToFMS) revealed specific accumulation of typically unmonitored POPs-like compounds in raptors.A research team in Ehime University, Japan conducted a comprehensive profiling of chlorinated and brominated compounds bioaccumulated in the liver of various wild bird species from Osaka, Japan in order to find potentially harmful but  hidden  contaminants. The team found a specific accumulation of several groups of typically unmonitored halogenated contaminants in raptors, including those so far never been reported in wild animals. The findings were published in Environmental Science & Technology on June 8, 2021.Ecological risk assessment of halogenated contaminants is an important issue, as many of these chemicals persist in the environment, bioaccumulate through the food web, and can cause lasting adverse effects. Chemicals listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention including legacy industrial chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and legacy organochlorine pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlordane, etc. are monitored in the environment, animals, and humans by national and international programs, typically using chemical analysis targeting specific predetermined groups of POPs. However, conventional analytical methods cannot detect untargeted contaminants such as chemical synthesis byproducts, and environmental transformation products. There is increasing evidence for the occurrence of many typically unmonitored and unknown bioaccumulative contaminants in the environment and biota, but the accumulation levels and behavior of such POPs-like contaminants in various food webs remain unclear. The research team in Ehime University used advanced analytical methods based on two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC GC), time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS), and software mass spectral filtering for comprehensive profiling of chlorinated and brominated contaminants in the liver of terrestrial and brackish water bird species from Osaka, Japan. Relatively high levels of typically unmonitored halogenated contaminants, including polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs), various DDT- and chlordane-related compounds, were found in raptors. Notably, chlordane byproducts with C15-based structures were detected for the first time in wild animals and showed high biomagnification potential in the terrestrial food web. These findings highlight the need for further studies on occurrence, structure elucidation and toxicological assessment of unmonitored POPs-like contaminants. The study was part of an effort to build a complementary digital archive of comprehensive chemical screening data for a chemical monitoring repository for environmental and biological specimens (ChemTHEATRE, Ehime University).ReferenceTue NM, Goto A, Fumoto M, Nakatsu S, Tanabe S, Kunisue T.

Of particular concern are influenza-related PA and COVID-19-related PA, the case numbers of which are growing quickly. Azoles   a class of antifungal compounds often used as antifungal drugs to treat aspergillosis   are also widely used as agricultural fungicides. Azole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus are spreading in the environment, potentially promoted by agricultural azole use. Azole resistance is a factor known to affect the treatment of PA, and there is concern that this problem is only worsening. Understanding how the genetic variation linked with azole resistance in A. fumigatus strains is distributed and enriched in the environment is necessary for suppressing resistant strains,  says senior author of the study Daisuke Hagiwara.  In this study, we set out to do this by investigating the genetics of those strains. Previously, the research team found several azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains attached to imported plant bulbs for sale in Japanese gardening shops. In this study, they investigated eight strains of azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolated from a single tulip bulb bought in Japan. The researchers used genome sequencing and comparative analysis, and compared the strains for sensitivity to agricultural and medical azoles, in addition to other classes of fungicides. The results indicated that there had previously been genetic recombination between the strains, and that some of them exhibited tolerance to other fungicide classes. Our results show that plant bulbs provide not just a vehicle for this pathogen, but also an ideal niche for its strains to encounter each other, and to evolve their resistance to drugs,  says Hagiwara.This study fills gaps in the knowledge of azole-resistant A. fumigatus, providing important information on the genetics behind an urgent global One Health challenge. The research team s findings will inform a deeper understanding of drug-resistant fungi and help with the development of future solutions to this problem.Reference: Takahashi H, Oiki S, Kusuya Y, Urayama S, Hagiwara D.

Women who consumed avocado as part of their daily meal had a reduction in deeper visceral abdominal fat. Led by Naiman Khan, an Illinois professor of kinesiology and community health, the researchers published their study, funded by the Hass Avocado Board, in the Journal of Nutrition.  The goal wasn t weight loss; we were interested in understanding what eating an avocado does to the way individuals store their body fat. The location of fat in the body plays an important role in health,  Khan said.  In the abdomen, there are two kinds of fat: fat that accumulates right underneath the skin, called subcutaneous fat, and fat that accumulates deeper in the abdomen, known as visceral fat, that surrounds the internal organs. Individuals with a higher proportion of that deeper visceral fat tend to be at a higher risk of developing diabetes. So we were interested in determining whether the ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat changed with avocado consumption,  he said. The participants were divided into two groups. One group received meals that incorporated a fresh avocado, while the other group received a meal that had nearly identical ingredients and similar calories but did not contain avocado. At the beginning and end of the 12 weeks, the researchers measured participants  abdominal fat and their glucose tolerance, a measure of metabolism and a marker of diabetes. Female participants who consumed an avocado a day as part of their meal had a reduction in visceral abdominal fat   the hard-to-target fat associated with higher risk   and experienced a reduction in the ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat, indicating a redistribution of fat away from the organs. However, fat distribution in males did not change, and neither males nor females had improvements in glucose tolerance.  While daily consumption of avocados did not change glucose tolerance, what we learned is that a dietary pattern that includes an avocado every day impacted the way individuals store body fat in a beneficial manner for their health, but the benefits were primarily in females,  Khan said.  It s important to demonstrate that dietary interventions can modulate fat distribution. Learning that the benefits were only evident in females tells us a little bit about the potential for sex playing a role in dietary intervention responses.  The researchers said they hope to conduct a follow-up study that would provide participants with all their daily meals and look at additional markers of gut health and physical health to get a more complete picture of the metabolic effects of avocado consumption and determine whether the difference remains between the two sexes.  Our research not only sheds a valuable light on benefits of daily avocado consumption on the different types of fat distribution across genders, it provides us with a foundation to conduct further work to understand the full impact avocados have on body fat and health,  said study coauthor Richard Mackenzie, a professor of human metabolism at the University of Roehampton in London.  By taking our research further, we will be able to gain a clearer picture into which types of people would benefit most from incorporating avocados into their diets and deliver valuable data for health care advisers to provide patients with guidance on how to reduce fat storage and the potential dangers of diabetes,  Mackenzie said.ReferenceKhan NA, Edwards CG, Thompson SV, et al.

Researchers have designed a two-dose therapeutic cancer vaccine using Oxford s viral vector vaccine technology.When tested in mouse tumour models, the cancer vaccine increased the levels of anti-tumour T cells infiltrating the tumours and improved the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Compared to immunotherapy alone, the combination with the vaccine showed a greater reduction in tumour size and improved the survival of the mice. The study, which was done by Professor Benoit Van den Eynde s group at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Oxford in collaboration with co-authors Professor Adrian Hill and Dr Irina Redchenko at the University s Jenner Institute, has been published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer.Cancer immunotherapy - turning a patient s own immune system against a tumour   has resulted in remarkable improvements in outcomes for some cancer patients. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy works by taking the brakes off anti-tumour T cells to allow them to kill cancer cells. However, despite this success, anti-PD-1 therapy is ineffective in the majority of cancer patients.One reason for the poor efficacy of anti-PD-1 cancer therapy is that some patients have low levels of anti-tumour T cells. Oxford s vaccine technology, used in the creation of the world-famous Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, generates strong CD8+ T cell responses, which are required for good anti-tumour effects.The team developed a two-dose therapeutic cancer vaccine with different prime and boost viral vectors, one of which is the same as the vector in the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. In order to create a vaccine treatment that specifically targets cancer cells, the vaccine was designed to target two MAGE-type proteins that are present on the surface of many types of cancer cells. Called MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1, these two targets were previously validated by the Ludwig Institute. Preclinical experiments in mouse tumour models demonstrated that the cancer vaccine increased the levels of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and enhanced the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The combined vaccine and anti-PD-1 treatment resulted in a greater reduction in tumour size and improved the survival of the mice compared to anti-PD-1 therapy alone.Benoit Van den Eynde, Professor of Tumour Immunology at the University of Oxford, Member of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Director of the de Duve Institute, Belgium, says,  We knew from our previous research that MAGE-type proteins act like red flags on the surface of cancer cells to attract immune cells that destroy tumours. MAGE proteins have an advantage over other cancer antigens as vaccine targets since they are present on a wide range of tumour types. This broadens the potential benefit of this approach to people with many different types of cancer. Importantly for target specificity, MAGE-type antigens are not present on the surface of normal tissues, which reduces the risk of side-effects caused by the immune system attacking healthy cells. A Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the cancer vaccine in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in 80 patients with non-small cell lung cancer will be launched later this year as a collaboration between Vaccitech Oncology Limited (VOLT) and Cancer Research UK s Centre for Drug Development.Adrian Hill, Lakshmi Mittal and Family Professorship of Vaccinology and Director of the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, says,  This new vaccine platform has the potential to revolutionise cancer treatment. The forthcoming trial in non-small cell lung cancer follows a Phase 2a trial of a similar cancer vaccine in prostate cancer undertaken by the University of Oxford that is showing promising results. Our cancer vaccines elicit strong CD8+ T cell responses that infiltrate tumours and show great potential in enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and improving outcomes for patients with cancer. Tim Elliott, Kidani Professor of Immuno-oncology at the University of Oxford and co-Director of Oxford Cancer, says,  In Oxford, we are combining our fundamental scientific expertise in immunology and antigen discovery with translational research on vaccine platforms. By bringing these teams together we can continue to address the significant challenge of broadening the positive impact of immunotherapy to benefit more patients. This vaccination approach using different prime and boost viral vectors was licensed by Jenner Institute scientists to Vaccitech Ltd, founded in 2016. The new therapeutic cancer vaccine is being developed by Vaccitech Oncology Limited (VOLT), a strategic collaboration between the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Vaccitech Plc.

Professor Cassidy, chair of nutrition and preventive medicine at IGFS, was lead investigator in the study of over 900 adults which has been published in Hypertension, an American Heart Association journal. What we eat plays a critical role in shaping our gut microbiome but little is known about the relative importance of plant foods and specific constituents called flavonoids. There is mounting evidence from population-based studies and clinical trials that a higher intake of flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods can improve heart health but for the first time we provide data highlighting the key role of the gut microbiome in explaining the associations between flavonoid-rich foods and blood pressure (BP). Up to 15% of the observed association was explained by the gut microbiome suggesting these microbes play a key role in metabolising flavonoids to enhance their cardioprotective effects.  In this study of >900 Germany adults we found that higher habitual intakes of flavonoid-rich foods, specifically berries, red wine, apples/pears were associated with clinically relevant reductions in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, greater microbial diversity and lower abundance of Parabacteroides.  These blood pressure lowering effects are achievable with simple changes to the daily diet. Eating ~1.5 servings berries/day was associated with a 4.1 mmHg reduction in systolic BP, and 12% of the association was explained by gut microbiome factors. Drinking ~3 glasses/week of red wine was associated with 3.7 mmHg lower systolic BP levels, of which 15% could be explained by the gut microbiome.  Prof Cassidy said:  Our gut microbiome plays a key role in metabolising flavonoids to enhance their cardioprotective effects, and this study provides evidence to suggest these blood pressure-lowering effects are achievable with simple changes to the daily diet.  Our findings indicate future trials should look at participants according to metabolic profile in order to more accurately study the roles of metabolism and the gut microbiome in regulating the effects of flavonoids on blood pressure. A better understanding of the highly individual variability of flavonoid metabolism could very well explain why some people have greater cardiovascular protection benefits from flavonoid-rich foods than others.  The flavonoid gut microbiome interaction associated with blood pressure highlighted in this paper suggest research should focus on inter-individual variability in the gut microbiome in mediating the cardiovascular benefits.    The analysis of habitual flavonoid intake with gut microbiome and blood pressure levels found:  - Study participants who had the highest intake of flavonoid-rich foods, including berries, red wine, apples and pears, had lower systolic blood pressure levels, as well as greater diversity in their gut microbiome than the participants who consumed the lowest levels of flavonoid-rich foods. - Up to 15.2% of the association between flavonoid-rich foods and systolic blood pressure could be explained by the diversity found in participants  gut microbiome. - Eating 80 grams of berries a day was associated with an average reduction in systolic blood pressure levels of 4.1 mm Hg, and about 12% of the association was explained by gut microbiome factors. - Drinking 250ml of red wine a week, just under three small glasses, was associated with an average of 3.7mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure level of which 15% could be explained by the gut microbiome.

By streamlining a longstanding process in which CO2 is converted to methane, the researchers  new method reduces the materials needed to run the reaction, the energy needed to fuel it and, ultimately, the selling price of the gas. A key chemical player known as EEMPA makes the process possible. EEMPA is a PNNL-developed solvent that snatches CO2 from power plant flue gas, binding the greenhouse gas so it can be converted into useful chemicals. Earlier this year, PNNL researchers revealed that using EEMPA in power plants could slash the price of carbon capture to 19 percent lower than standard industry costs the lowest documented price of carbon capture. Now, in a study published Friday, August 21 in the journal ChemSusChem, the team reveals a new incentive in cheaper natural gas to further drive down costs.When compared to the conventional method of methane conversion, the new process requires an initial investment that costs 32 percent less. Operation and maintenance costs are 35 percent cheaper, bringing the selling price of synthetic natural gas down by 12 percent. ","Published: September 6, 2021"

Yet while impressive, an earthworm's regenerative capacity is child's play compared with that of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. This species, a type of flatworm, can regrow an entire animal from tiny tissue fragments as minuscule as 1/279th of the animal.How does this happen? What cell types contribute to this astounding regenerative capacity? Besides stem cells, which are obviously important, how many other cell types are important for regulating this process, and what do they do?Recent research published September 2, 2021, in Nature Cell Biology by members of the S nchez Alvarado Lab at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research provides some early answers to these complex questions.""It was already known that the wound-induced epidermis and the wound-induced muscle played different roles in regeneration, but we wanted to understand the big picture,"" explains lead author Blair Benham-Pyle, PhD, a postdoctoral scientist in the lab of Stowers Institute Executive Director and Chief Scientific Officer and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Alejandro S nchez Alvarado, PhD.""This is the first study that definitively found that all three germ layers (muscle, epidermis, and intestine) of Schmidtea mediterranea transcriptionally respond to amputation, and that both tissues near the wound site and far away from the wound site are contributing to regenerative capacity,"" says Benham-Pyle.""Regeneration was a little bit of a black box before -- we knew some genes that were important, and we could look at how some genes were altered globally in response to amputation and during regeneration, but we didn't know how individual cell types across the animal were changing their behavior or function. That's what this experiment allowed us to characterize.""""The dream experiment,"" described Benham-Pyle, and what they ultimately accomplished, was to ""characterize gene expression on the single-cell level, across all of the different cell types of a regenerating animal, over time.""At first, the researchers considered doing the experiment using large-scale RNA sequencing because droplet-based single-cell sequencing -- where every single cell is encapsulated in a lipid droplet with a barcode, and then lysed to label all mRNAs with that barcode -- was not feasible at the scale needed for this experiment. But in early 2017, S nchez Alvarado came across a preprint that had just been posted to bioRxiv reporting a new single-cell sequencing method named SplitSeq. Once Benham-Pyle had reviewed and discussed with S nchez Alvarado the merits of the work in the preprint, they decided to give it a go. After several tries, a number of optimizations, and troubleshooting with the molecular biology and cytometry technology center teams, Benham-Pyle succeeded in bringing a new single-cell sequencing technology to the Stowers Institute.After getting it to work, Benham-Pyle and colleagues captured almost 300,000 single cell transcriptomes across eight different tissues and the stem cell compartment in animals that had lost the ability to regenerate, compared with those that were capable of regenerating.""This allowed us to look at all of the different cell types across the entire animal to see which responded to amputation and what genes were marking these cells as they changed and responded to regeneration,"" explains Benham-Pyle.The researchers found and characterized five different cell types, from all three germ layers, that transiently altered their transcriptional output after amputation. When genes enriched in these cell types were knocked down, says Benham-Pyle, ""we found that all of them contribute to regeneration in different ways, being activated at different times and in different parts of the body.""Some of their findings were more unexpected than others. For example, that muscle is important for patterning, and that the epidermis is important for early stem cell proliferation bursts during regeneration, was not as unexpected. The researchers were surprised, however, to discover rare cells, states induced during whole-body regeneration, called transient regeneration-activating cell states (TRACS), and to find that the intestine seems to be important for both stem cell maintenance and regulating tissue remodeling after amputation.""I didn't expect the intestine to globally change its output and remodel its function after injury,"" says Benham-Pyle. ""But if you think about it, it does make sense. The planarian normally grows its body plan based on its nutrient environment. The worm eats, and that fuels a burst of stem cell proliferation and the addition of new biomass. When you cut the animal, especially in extreme injury, it often loses its ability to eat. All of the growth and remodeling now needs to be fueled by nutrients already existing within the body plan. So, after amputation, the intestine alters its function to scavenge material from dying cells within the animal, and to convert those materials into new healthy cells in a regenerated worm.""Acquiring and making sense of the data was a team effort""We had to do all of our manuscript revisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were at 50% research capacity,"" recounts Benham-Pyle. ""Sean McKinney and the Microscopy Center found ways to automate imaging, and we worked out a system where I could give them forty to eighty slides at a time, of all different samples and RNAi conditions, to be imaged on overnight runs. They were able to generate terabytes of imaging data for us on the scanning confocal microscope, which helped give us the big lift we needed to get the paper accepted. They set a very high bar for microscopy facilities.""Other coauthors of the study include: Carolyn E. Brewster, a bioinformatics specialist who helped analyze the data generated from the experiment, and was instrumental in creating the website associated with the paper; Aubrey M. Kent, who helped describe some of the first RNAi phenotypes that came out of the dataset (she is now following up on some of the epidermal genes that were found to affect the stem cell compartment); Frederick G. Mann, PhD, who helped clone many of the genes that Benham-Pyle screened and characterized in the paper; Shiyuan Chen; Allison R. Scott; and Andrew C. Box; and Alejandro S nchez Alvarado, PhD.Taking a step back, ""what this paper does is take a global look at what sorts of cells need to be in a signaling environment to stimulate stem cells to create new tissue and replace missing tissue,"" Benham-Pyle reflects.""It turns out that a number of genes that we characterized, for instance in the intestine, have also been implicated in immune evasion in the context of cancer, or in wound healing. A lot of the same mechanisms that stem cells use to avoid the immune system and to fuel proliferation and growth during regeneration may be the same mechanisms that are co-opted by tumors. By understanding what non-stem cell states and tissue types are helping to create that signaling environment, we might eventually find new targets for either stimulating healthy and normal wound healing in contexts where regenerative capacity is limited, or, limiting growth capacities of things that we don't want to grow, like tumors.""""Now that we have a map, we can go and figure out how the cells are talking to each other, what they're doing, and how they're doing it.""Reference: Benham-Pyle BW, Brewster CE, Kent AM, et al.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/why-are-only-some-cells-competent-to-form-cancer-353310,Why Are Only Some Cells  Competent  To Form Cancer  Right now  in your body  lurk thousands of cells with DNA mistakes that could cause cancer  Yet only in rare instances do these DNA mistakes  called genetic mutations  lead to a full blown cancer  Why  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Right now, in your body, lurk thousands of cells with DNA mistakes that could cause cancer. Yet only in rare instances do these DNA mistakes, called genetic mutations, lead to a full-blown cancer. Why?The standard explanation is that it takes a certain number of genetic ""hits"" to a cell's DNA to push a cell over the edge. But there are well-known cases in which the same set of mutations clearly causes cancer in one context, but not in another.A good example is a mole. The cells making up a mole are genetically abnormal. Quite often, they contain a mutated DNA version of the BRAF gene that, when found in cells located outside of a mole, will often lead to melanoma. But the vast majority of moles will never turn cancerous. It's a conundrum that has scientists looking to cellular context for clues to explain the difference.To get at that question, Dr. White teamed up with MSK developmental biologist Lorenz Studer, an expert at creating and using stem cells to study and treat disease. Through their complementary expertise -- and the efforts of postdoctoral fellow Arianna Baggiolini and graduate student Scott Callahan -- they were able to investigate how cancer genetics and developmental biology cooperate in cancer formation. A decade later, the results are in.In a paper published September 3, 2021 in Science, Drs. White and Studer and their team report that melanoma formation depends on something called ""oncogenic competence,"" which is the result of a collaboration between the DNA mutations in a cell and the particular set of genes that are turned on in that cell. Cells that are competent to form melanoma are able to access a set of genes that normally are closed off to mature melanocytes (the cells that make melanin and give skin its color). In order to access these locked-up genes, the cells require specific proteins that act as keys. Without them, the cells do not form melanoma, even when they have cancer-associated DNA mutations.The findings provide an explanation for why some cells, but not others, can form cancer, and offer potential therapeutic targets that could one day help patients.From Fish to HumansThe collaborative project started more than a decade ago and began with an observation that Dr. White made while he was still a postdoc studying melanoma in zebrafish. These tiny fish are great for studying melanoma development because you can see tumors growing beneath the fish's scales, and it's easy to remove the tumors and study them at the molecular level.""When we looked at these melanomas in zebrafish, we could see that there were a number of active genes that are more characteristic of embryonic cells rather than mature melanocytes,"" Dr. White says. ""We were curious why these genes were turned on. Are they important in the development of the melanoma, and if so how?""To answer this question, Dr. White and his team genetically modified zebrafish to contain a mutated BRAF gene -- the same one that is found in about one-half of melanomas. They introduced the BRAF gene in such a way that it would be turned on at three different stages of melanocyte development in different fish: at the neural crest stage (NC), the melanoblast stage (MB), and the melanocyte stage (MC). These stages refer to cell states that are progressively more differentiated. (You can think of the stages as akin to melanocyte kindergarten, elementary school, and high school.) Then, they let the fish grow up and watched for tumors.After several months, they found that only the fish with BRAF activated at the NC and MB stages were capable of forming tumors (what the researchers call ""oncogenic competence""). Cells with BRAF activated at the MC stage instead formed moles.The result was striking. But what is true of fish isn't necessarily true of humans. So, to extend these results, Dr. White teamed up with Dr. Studer to perform similar experiments on human cells. Dr. Studer's team had previously shown that they could use human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to make each of the three stages of melanocyte development. In this case, they introduced the mutated BRAF gene into hPSCs at the same three stages that were studied in the fish, and then implanted these cells in mice to see which were able to form tumors. Once again, only the first two stages -- NC and MB -- were consistently able to form tumors.What Controls 'Competence'?Encouraged by these findings, the researchers went further to investigate a possible mechanism. Using what's called ""molecular profiling,"" they compared what was different about the active genes in the three stages -- for both the zebrafish tumors and the human stem cell-derived tumors. From this comparison, they were able to see that a key difference was a particular protein, ATAD2, that was active in NC and MB cells, but not in MC cells.ATAD2 is what's called a chromatin modifying factor: It binds to areas of a chromosome near genes and allows those genes to be turned on (technically, transcribed into messenger RNA and translated into protein). Proteins like ATAD2 alter the ""epigenome"" of the cell -- the way that DNA is packaged and spooled in a cell -- rather than the ""genome"" -- the sequence of DNA itself. Cells with ATAD2 can turn on a unique set of genes that are normally only seen in embryonic development, while those without it cannot. In other words, ATAD2 is the key that unlocks these genes.To prove that ATAD2 was playing a decisive role, the scientists did additional experiments where they either took ATAD2 away or added it back in. When the scientists removed ATAD2 in a melanoma-prone zebrafish model, the cells lost their ability to form tumors. When they added it to MC cells, the cells gained this capacity. This told the researchers that ATAD2 was indeed a key lever of oncogenic competence.Taking advantage of the vast amount of clinical data available at MSK and through the The Cancer Genome Atlas, they could show that ATAD2 is important in cancer: Patients with high amounts of ATAD2 have significantly worse survival, suggesting it plays an important role in determining the outcome of DNA mutations like BRAF.Targeting the Context, Not Just the MutationsThe scientists say their results offer an important new perspective on cancer formation, one that contrasts with conventional wisdom.""The standard idea that has been around for decades is that you basically need two types of DNA mutations to get cancer: an activated oncogene and a disabled tumor suppressor gene,"" Dr. White says. ""Once you clear those two hurdles, cancer will form. Now we have this entirely other thing -- oncogenic competence -- which adds a third layer to the mix.""Dr. Baggiolini, a lead author on the study and a postdoctoral fellow in the Studer lab, likens the situation to starting a fire. ""The DNA mutations are like a lit match: If you have the wrong wood or if the wood is wet, you might get a bit of flickering but no fire. But if you have the right wood, and maybe some kindling, the whole thing burns up.""In this example, ATAD2 is the kindling. Developing a drug to remove this kindling would be another way to treat the cancer besides targeting the DNA mutations.A Technique with Future PotentialThe hPSC techniques the team developed to study melanoma may prove to have wide applications for personalized cancer treatment. Already, Drs. White and Studer are using the technique to create disease models of individual patients' cancer. From a patient's blood, they can obtain cells to make hPSCs. They can then introduce to these cells the specific mutations that characterize the patients tumor. These genetically matched cells can then be used to test a large panel of drugs to see which may benefit the patient. These drugs can then be brought back to the zebrafish to ensure they really work in a living animal. The researchers believe this crossing over between cells in a dish and animal studies gives them the best chance of finding drugs that will work in patients.""With hPSCs, we can potentially create patient-specific disease models of cancer for any different tissue in the body, be it from the brain or the liver or another organ,"" Dr. Studer says. ""I really hope that this will become a routine part of care.""It's likely no coincidence that these far-reaching results are the product of a steady, decade-long collaboration between two labs with different expertise. ""It's almost become a clich  to say that science is better in collaboration, but in this case it really was critical,"" Dr. White says.He adds: ""Everyone wants science to go fast. We want science to go fast too. But sometimes science has to go slow to get to the core truth.""Reference: Baggiolini A, Callahan SJ, Montal E, et al.

Next-generation brain stimulation devices can modulate brain activity without human intervention, which raises new ethical and policy questions. But while there is a great deal of speculation about the potential consequences of these innovative treatments, very little is currently known about patients  experiences of any device approved for clinical use,  said lead author Tobias Haeusermann of the University of California. This issue is becoming even more pressing, as several similar treatments are currently under development for several common neurological and psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety chronic pain, Alzheimer s disease and ischemic stroke   offering the promise of effective new treatments for these debilitating illnesses. Closed-loop brain stimulation systems can monitor and decode brain activity and automatically adjust treatment   delivered through electrical pulses   based on internal software algorithms. These implantable devices may provide more precise and personalized treatment than  open loop  systems, which have been used for decades to treat Parkinson s disease and other conditions by applying consistent pre-programmed stimulation to targeted brain areas.Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes seizures and affects around three million US adults. Around one-third of people with the condition will eventually develop refractory epilepsy   which means that current medications don t work well, or at all, at controlling their seizures. While brain surgery can be helpful, it isn t suitable for all patients.In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a closed-loop brain stimulation system for treating refractory epilepsy. This study followed 12 patients, and their family caregivers, over two years to find out about their experiences of this implant, which is the first clinically approved and commercially available closed-loop brain stimulation device. We found that the brain implants did not transform patients  sense of self or personality. Neither the long-term implantation of the electronic device in their brain, nor the electrical stimulation to modulate their brain function, led to changes in their self-perceptions   or the perceptions of the patient by family members and others around them,  said Haeusermann.  This is reassuring news for more than 3,000 patients with refractory epilepsy implanted with this device to date   as well as the many others who may consider this treatment as a way to prevent their seizures in the future. The results also highlighted the importance of evaluating the potential effects of brain stimulation in relation to patients  previous neurological conditions and medications, which were recognized by both patients and family members as having a profound impact on their personality and self-perception.The ability of next-generation brain stimulation devices to record, store and display brain data could also offer patients new ways of understanding and making sense of their illness. But the results of the study also indicated that if a patient s experiences are not corroborated by the technology, they and others around them can begin to question their understanding of their illness. While patients generally valued the opportunity to view data collected by these devices, the process could also create uncertainties. Generating what appeared to be objective records of their illness might be interpreted as discrediting a patient s own reports,  said Haeusermann.  Researchers may need to more carefully consider how patients will make meaning from data that are collected, stored and interpreted by these devices. Design choices such as user interface, options for data use and portability, and the degree of anticipated interaction with clinicians, may have unintended effects on how patients understand their brains and brain conditions. However, the authors noted that the brain implant used for these epilepsy patients does not have many of the more advanced functions that are envisioned for future devices. For example, these systems might be designed to exert effects specifically through programmed alterations to patients  personalities and behaviors for treating psychiatric disorders.Reference: Haeusermann T, Lechner CR, Fong KC, et al.

Different people vary in the amount and type of antibodies they produce,  said Kelly Arnold, U-M assistant professor of biomedical engineering and a corresponding author on a new study published in Cell Reports Medicine.  Depending on their genetics, they also have different protein sequences in their antibodies and immune cell receptors that cause them to bind differently. That situation is difficult for researchers to understand based on experiments. And that s why this computational model has been so valuable. We can make personalized models for different people that take all of these different factors into account. Vaccines can work in two ways: by sending neutralizing antibodies to bind an invasive virus and prevent it from infecting cells, or by activating innate immune cells to attack pathogens. The former works for relatively static viruses, like measles, but for viruses like HIV and flu, activating immune cells can make up for the fact that antibodies aren t always a perfect match for the virus. The trouble is that the type and amount of the antibodies can influence immune cell activation differently, as shown by the study. With rapidly mutating viruses like HIV and the flu, there is variability in both the viral population and the people it s infecting,  said Melissa Lemke, a U-M Ph.D. candidate in biomedical engineering and lead author on the paper.  This means that in order to protect all people to the same degree from a variety of viral mutations, we will need an array of possible solutions that can be matched to any given person s health status, sex, age and genetic background. Computational tools like this one are going to be essential in speeding up the search for mechanisms that can be implemented to create effective vaccines for all. The U-M model used data obtained by the University of Melbourne from the only moderately protective HIV vaccine trial to date. The model examined plasma samples from trial participants basically blood samples minus the red blood cells looking at the amount and type of antibodies produced after vaccination.The model predicted that boosting levels of antibodies does not activate immune cells across the board for all individuals. Depending on a subject s baseline antibody levels and genetic background, increasing those antibodies can produce results running the gamut from benefiting some patients, to doing nothing for others, to potentially reducing immune cell activation in others.The U-M team evaluated 30 people from the trial and selected the eight whose immune cell receptors were most likely to bind with vaccine-induced antibodies, and the eight least likely to respond well. Then, the team at Melbourne ran experiments adding antibodies and HIV viruses to plasma samples.When an antibody binds to a pathogen and to an immune cell, the formation of this  immune complex  signals the immune cell to destroy the pathogen. Samples from trial participants predicted to respond saw a fivefold to sevenfold increase in immune complexes. In contrast, nonresponders saw only a 1.3-fold increase in immune complexes. This shows that making antibodies that bind well to the virus is not necessarily enough to make a vaccine protective the immune cells need to be able to bind to the antibodies.Reference: Lemke MM, McLean MR, Lee CY, et al.

HPV infections are often silent, and while most infections clear, some are chronic and can trigger cancers including mouth and throat (oropharyngeal), and cervical cancer because they disrupt DNA and inhibit tumor-suppressor proteins in the cells they infect. Although there is no cure for existing HPV infections, new infections are preventable with vaccines, the first of which entered use in the U.S. in 2006.In the new study, the Bloomberg School researchers analyzed national databases on oropharyngeal cancer cases and HPV vaccinations, and projected the impact of HPV vaccination on the rates of these cancers in different age groups. They estimated that the oropharyngeal cancer rate would nearly halve between 2018 and 2045 among people ages 36 45. However, they also projected that the rate in the overall population would stay about the same from 2018-2045, due to still-rising rates of these cancers in older people, where most of these cancers occur.The study appears online September 2 in JAMA Oncology. We estimate that most of the oropharyngeal cancers from 2018 to 2045 will occur among people who are 55 years and older and have not been vaccinated,  says study lead author Yuehan Zhang, a PhD candidate in the research group of Gypsyamber D Souza, PhD, professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Bloomberg School. HPV vaccination is going to work to prevent oropharyngeal cancers, but it will take time to see that impact, because these cancers mostly occur in middle age,  D Souza says.Oropharyngeal cancer is the most common HPV-related cancer, and according to the Oral Cancer Foundation there are more than 50,000 new cases of it in the U.S. each year. Alcohol and tobacco use also are risk factors, but are seen as increasingly less important than HPV.Vaccination is a powerful medical weapon against this family of viruses, but has one major shortcoming: It can prevent, but not treat. In other words, it does not work against established HPV infections or against cells that have been transformed by HPV and are on their way to forming tumors. Thus it is recommended chiefly for the young who are not yet exposed to sexually transmitted HPV. (Most people who were already adults when HPV vaccination became available have never been vaccinated, and thus remain at risk for these cancers.)For the study, the researchers estimated current and future HPV vaccination rates using data from surveys conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and projected oropharyngeal cancer rates based on past and current incidence data from the National Cancer Institute.They estimated that the rates of vaccination by 2045, for different age groups given the emphasis on vaccinating the young will amount to about 72 percent of people ages 36 45, 37 percent of those ages 46 55, 9 percent of those ages 56 69, and 0 percent of people ages 70 83 being vaccinated.These projections show continuing high oropharyngeal cancer rates in older, mostly unvaccinated groups, and almost no change in the overall U.S. rate of these cancers 14.3 per 100,000 assuming no vaccination; and 13.8 per 100,000, with vaccination, in 2045.However, they foresaw the rates of new oropharyngeal cancers would fall substantially in the relatively well vaccinated 36 45 and 46 55 age groups during the 2018 2045 period: from 1.4 to 0.8 per 100,000; and from 8.7 to 7.2 per 100,000, respectively.The results suggest, though, that by 2045 HPV vaccination will have begun to make a significant impact.  Our projections suggest that by around 2033, nearly 100 cases of oropharyngeal cancer will be prevented each year, but by 2045 that figure will have increased by about ten times,  Zhang says.Reference: Zhang Y, Fakhry C, D Souza G.

Intestinal epithelial cells are needed for regulating immune function, communicating with the intestinal microbiota, and protecting the gut from pathogen infection   all of which critically depend on an intact epithelial barrier.Affecting roughly 3 million Americans, IBD is a set of chronic intestinal diseases in which the lining of the gut becomes inflamed and leaky. Increased gut leakiness has recently been confirmed to increase the risk of developing IBD.  This new publication is a culmination of a body of work from my lab identifying how loss-of-function mutations in PTPN2 can increase gut permeability or leakiness,  said Declan F. McCole, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR School of Medicine, who led the study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The journal has selected the research paper as an ""Editor s highlight.""In the study, which was conducted in mice, human cells, and tissue from IBD patients, McCole and his colleagues showed that in IBD patients carrying a loss-of-function PTPN2 mutation, the expression of claudin-2, a protein that causes loss of water and sodium into the gut and promotes diarrhea, is increased. Using mouse models, the McCole lab identified a dual mechanism that explains how claudin-2 expression increases and contributes to fluid loss. PTPN2 typically acts as a brake on the expression of claudin-2, McCole explained. The loss-of-function mutation in PTPN2 that occurs in IBD removes this brake and allows increased fluid loss.  In addition, PTPN2 also promotes an endogenous factor, called matriptase, that removes claudin-2 from the area of the cell membrane where it mediates its effects in allowing fluid loss to occur,  McCole said. The cumulative effect of reduced PTPN2 activity on both mechanisms was elevated fluid loss. The researchers proved this defect could be reversed by treating cells lacking PTPN2 with recombinant   or synthetic   matriptase.  Our work improves understanding of how the genetics of IBD can contribute to the altered physiology in patients that drives their symptoms,  McCole said.  It also supports our related work identifying how the class of drugs, called JAK inhibitors, may be used to rescue  leaky gut,  particularly in patients with loss-of-function mutations in the PTPN2 gene. The study also showed that a recently identified and rare novel mutation in PTPN2, which causes gut epithelial damage in children, also increases gut epithelial leakiness   but without causing epithelial cell death.  This suggests that patients who develop this condition may exhibit  leaky gut  before full-blown disease occurs,  McCole said.McCole was supported in the study by co-first authors Moorthy Krishnan and Marianne R. Spalinger of UCR, and Ronald Marchelletta of UC San Diego.

In a new study, chemists demonstrate the first electrochemical redox desalination process used in the food industry, removing and recycling up to 99% of excess salt from whey while simultaneously refining more than 98% of whey s valuable protein content.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, cheese consumption has soared in recent years, and projections estimate its continued growth. The study reports that cheese production contributes to roughly 83% of the total waste stream in the dairy industry. This environmental detriment, along with a rapidly increasing population need for sustainable food systems, inspired University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Xiao Su to approach this challenge using advanced electrochemical technologies.  The desalination process introduced in this study uses up to 73% less energy and functions at 62% of the operating cost associated with conventional desalination systems, the researchers said. The findings of the study led by Illinois graduate student Nayeong Kim are published in the Chemical Engineering Journal. Although excess whey is wracked with several environmental waste problems, the food industry also recognizes it as a valuable nutrient source,  Su said.  By demineralizing the highly concentrated salts in whey waste in a sustainable manner, we can eliminate one of the environmental hazards associated with dairy processing while simultaneously unlocking access to the valuable protein resource found in whey waste. Su and his team approached this challenge by introducing a chemical redox-coupled dialysis system   a device that is not all that different from a battery cell. The method comprises two independently controllable channels for the whey waste and the electrodes, separated by a pair of ion-exchange membranes. Su said the process allows continuous desalination via a reversible redox reaction. Our system recovers valuable whey proteins without the risk of protein aggregation or denaturation,  Kim said.  Also, the molecular size of redox species is larger than the membrane pore size, meaning it cannot cross over the membrane to contaminate the purified proteins. I believe that the redox-mediated electrodialysis system can revolutionize the food industry by tackling coupled environmental and nutrition crises. During the protein purification process, positively charged sodium ions move from the feed to the redox channel and become chemically reduced at the negative electrode. The negatively charged chloride ions move to the redox channel when the reduced ions are oxidized at the positive electrode, resulting in a sustainable regeneration of the redox couple. The study reports that the redox channel can maintain its electrolyte concentration by releasing the removed ions to the feed channel, and recovered sodium chloride can be reused to season cheese, making it a net-zero waste process. Remarkably, the performance of protein purification and salt recovery was maintained over multiple cycles, demonstrating outstanding stability and cyclability,  Su said.  Overall, our redox-electrochemical process offers a sustainable and electrified platform for the recovery of valuable proteins from dairy production waste, with envisioned integration with renewable electricity in the future. We hope this will be the start of research into sustainable food manufacturing in general. Reference: Kim N, Jeon J, Elbert J, Kim C, Su X.

Characterizing the strain, designated SE_TAU19, will aid public health agencies in tracing outbreaks and preventing exposures.There are two species of Salmonella, and one of these, Salmonella enterica, is implicated in human disease. S. enterica contains over 2,500 serovars, or groups of bacteria, many of which can cause disease in humans. Salmonella serovar Enteritidis (SE) is most frequently associated with poultry and is the leading cause of human illness globally. Most human Salmonella infections are foodborne in origin, and many animals   such as chickens   can harbor the pathogen without becoming sick themselves. The ability of SE_TAU19 to cause clinical disease in poultry interested Grayson Walker, a combined DVM and Ph.D. student in Luke Borst s laboratory at NC State s College of Veterinary Medicine and first author of a paper describing the research.  We usually think of Salmonella as harbored by chickens without harming them; however, this strain was virulent and actually made them sick,  Walker says.  We also know that Salmonella likes to stick around. This strain killed broiler chickens throughout the growing period and recurred one year later in a different flock. So, we decided to sequence the genome and see which resistance and virulence features made the strain unique.  The team sequenced the genome of the strain and found that it included seven antimicrobial resistance genes, 120 virulence genes, and a large virulence plasmid. Plasmids are  swappable  genetic elements that can be exchanged between strains to make them more antibiotic resistant or infectious.  While we cannot say that it is a  new  strain of Salmonella, we can say that not only is this strain deadly to poultry, antibiotic resistant and infectious, but also that it could infect humans,  Walker says.  The good news is that by sequencing the genome we now have data that could help pinpoint the origin of and contain any future outbreaks. ReferenceWalker GK, Suyemoto MM, Hull DM, et al.

By showing relationships between genetics and compounds in apple fruits known as phytochemicals, the platform has potential to take some of the guesswork, and time, out of the breeding process: It typically takes about seven years to get from mating parent varieties to the first taste test of a new kind of apple, and it could take decades to create a completely new cultivar. Additionally, complementary research on phytochemicals that may provide health benefits could give researchers a head start on studies to confirm which compounds offer the best chance to develop a more nutritious apple, said study author Jessica Cooperstone, assistant professor of horticulture and crop science at Ohio State.  It s an approach that allows us to better understand how apple genetics affect the production of many compounds in apple fruit. We wanted to help develop tools that make this process simpler and allow people to use data to make decisions about the apple breeding process,  she said. Cooperstone specializes in chemical compounds called metabolites that make apples and tomatoes nutritious. She and her colleagues focus on figuring out how to create and grow the most healthful versions of these crops as possible.  If we can improve the nutritional quality of crops, we should. My philosophy has always been to improve foods people already eat   let s not improve something and then have to convince people to eat it,  said Cooperstone, who also has a faculty appointment in the Department of Food Science and Technology.  The foods that people already want to eat create an opportunity to have impact. That s what we re really trying to do with our apple work.  The research was published online Sept. 1 in the journal New Phytologist. Co-authors on the study, all from Ohio State, include Kathryn Williamson and Emmanuel Hatzakis of food science and technology, and Diane Doud Miller and Jonathan Fresnedo Ram rez of horticulture and crop science. First author Emma Bilbrey worked on the platform while she was a graduate student in Cooperstone s lab. Apples are an important crop to Ohio and the Midwest, and are the No. 1 fruit consumed by Americans   apples constitute about 25% of all fruit eaten in the United States. The 124 apples analyzed in the study included common varieties such as Honeycrisp, Gala, Fuji and Golden Delicious as well as wild apples and prospective varieties being evaluated by Midwest growers. Genome-wide analysis of each apple enabled identification of genetic markers associated with metabolites that influence traits like flavor, disease resistance and texture. The researchers used high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to detect phytochemicals in the apples in a  global  way   an approach called untargeted metabolomics. The team then took on the larger challenge of integrating all the data to determine genotype-metabolite relationships that could guide apple breeding decision-making and inform nutrition studies of links between specific chemical compounds and health benefits. As part of the integration, the researchers assembled the data in a way that showed every genetic marker that had an association with production of at least one phytochemical.  We looked for strong relationships at locations in the genome that are not well studied in apple and looked for which compounds we could identify and which had nutritional value. We could go from untargeted data all the way to finding candidate genes responsible for compound production   which researchers can then validate,  Cooperstone said.  The goal is to do this in a holistic way so you re not improving nutrition while sacrificing yield, disease resistance and flavor   you re considering all of these components of having a good and productive apple, and putting them together and trying to improve it globally.  From here, the team plans to use the data to get a better understanding of health-promoting compounds of interest and employ biotechnological approaches that could speed up flowering and fruit production in apple trees.ReferenceBilbrey EA et al.

A growing body of data now demonstrates the importance of both T cells and antibodies in the coordinated immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This method is a further boost to scientists who seek to routinely monitor and assess SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses in vaccinated or convalescent individuals, as well as to test and verify the effectiveness of vaccines.  T cells play a vital role alongside antibodies in protecting people against COVID-19, but they are much harder to detect and measure,  said Dr Anthony Tanoto Tan, Senior Research Fellow with Duke-NUS  Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Programme and first author of the study.  Our research offers a feasible approach that can overcome the current limitations faced in detecting spike-specific T-cell responses, and will help better evaluate the protective role played by T cells in our immune system. For the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, scientists took blood samples from volunteers who were vaccinated against COVID-19, or who had been infected and then recovered from the disease. They then introduced small fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly into the blood samples. In response to these fragments, the T cells released chemical signals called cytokines, which are much easier to detect and measure than T cells, and are already being tracked to monitor T-cell activity for the diagnosis of diseases such as tuberculosis. Building on that, the team showed that the test, called Cytokine Release Assay (CRA), can reliably identify and quantify specific T cells present in the blood of people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, or have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Working with different blood samples from more than 200 people, the researchers desmonstrated that the CRA test was as sensitive as existing methods used to find and measure T-cell activity.  This discovery allows a rapid and large-scale expansion of studies to track T-cell activity across the world, while not requiring specialised or expensive equipment,  said Professor Antonio Bertoletti from Duke-NUS  EID programme, the study s corresponding author.  The study results  confirm that the level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples does not always correlate with the T-cell response. With this rapid test, we can help define the correlates of protection from T cells and antibodies for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Professor Patrick Casey, Senior Vice-Dean for Research at Duke-NUS, said,  This important study advances our understanding of the human body s immune response at a critical juncture in this pandemic. As validated in this research, repurposing the well-established CRA test to fast-track the evaluation of T-cell responses in COVID-inoculated or -convalescent patients adds a new dimension to vaccine strategies as we battle the threat of new and emergent variants. To bring this discovery to market, Duke-NUS has licensed the assay to Hyris, an innovation-based biotechnology company, which will leverage its Hyris SystemTM to further develop this rapid SARS-CoV-2 T-cell test for clinical use globally.Reference: Tan AT, Lim JME, Bert NL, et al.

Australia will return the same overall volume of doses before the end of the year.This arrangement is mutually beneficial and will ensure these Pfizer/BioNTech doses   which are not immediately required in the UK   are used to support international vaccination efforts. Sharing doses will mean Australia has access to vaccines they can put to use in their domestic campaign immediately and will enable the UK to better align timings of our own supply of vaccines with our future need - including for any booster programme or expansion of vaccines to teenagers, pending final advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.Thanks to the early work of the Vaccine Taskforce, the UK has ensured sufficient vaccine supplies for its domestic rollout and supported the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic by improving access to vaccines.Nearly 9 in 10 over 16s in the UK have received their first dose and over three-quarters have had both jabs. The government is confident in its vaccine supply and there will be no impact on the UK s ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout or any future booster programmes.This agreement comes as the UK announces the latest batch of its Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines have been delivered through COVAX   the international scheme designed to ensure vaccines are available for poorer countries around the world. In total, over 9 million COVID-19 vaccines from the UK have now been sent to developing nations across Africa and Asia.The COVAX doses are part of the 100 million vaccines the Prime Minister pledged the UK would share over the following year at June s G7 in Cornwall, with 30 million due to be sent by the end of the year.More than 592,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered to Nigeria on 26 August, and COVAX is scheduled to transport more than a million doses to Pakistan, 499,000 doses to Ethiopia and 105,000 doses to Niger.Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid said: Vaccines have built a strong wall of defence in the UK and we want to support nations around the world in recovering from COVID-19 and improving access to vaccines. Our agreement with Australia will share doses at the optimum time to bolster both our countries  vaccination programmes. By working with international partners to coordinate the rollout of life-saving vaccines, we will protect more people from this awful virus and save lives. Last month, the UK delivered 3 million vaccines through COVAX to 11 African countries including Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia   as well as sending 4 million directly to countries in need including Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Cambodia, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Thailand and Vietnam.Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab said:The UK is donating vaccines to help protect more than 2 million of the most vulnerable people across Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Niger, as part of the 100 million doses we ve pledged to share with the world. The UK continues to lead the global response to the pandemic because nobody is safe until everyone is safe. At least 80 million of the 100 million doses the UK will share will go to COVAX, with the rest going to countries directly. The donations will help meet the pledge that G7 leaders made to vaccinate the world. This article has been republished from the following materials.

Instead, it s the gases emitted from brewed coffee that contribute to the invigorating scent.The human nose captures those gases in a way that Nosang Vincent Myung, the Bernard Keating Crawford Professor of Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, is working to duplicate in a device with sensors. He and his team have developed a prototype of an electronic nose, using nanoengineered materials to tune the sensitivity and selectivity to mimic the performance and capabilities of a human nose. That s a tall order since the human nose with its approximately 400 scent receptors can distinguish millions of different smells. According to Myung, the chemical properties of gases affect the electrical properties of the sensing materials. By manipulating the size and shape of the nanoengineered materials, he and his team can make more precise sensors that function more efficiently and economically.  An electronic nose can be used for a variety of applications,  said Myung.  For example, we can detect air pollutants or greenhouse gases. But we can also use it to uncover drugs and bombs, sniff out cancer and bacterial infections, as well as identify natural gas leaks and assess food quality.  Myung was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation s Center for Bioanalytical Metrology for a Smart Process Analytical Technology System to monitor chemical/biochemical reactions in industrial and laboratory chemical processing applications in real time. He and his team also are designing a smart agricultural sensor system to monitor the nitrogen cycle in fields to help eliminate greenhouses gases while enhancing the yield of the produce being grown. In addition, they are developing a wearable smart sensor system for military personnel that can detect poisonous gases and other threats.  Developing better sensors is critical for a number of industries,  said Myung.  The future will be shaped by our ability to design and build smart, accurate and low-powered sensors that will help us better understand and interact with the world around us.

In their latest study, researchers at the Turku PET Centre, Finland, discovered a connection between the function of the opioid system and food craving triggered by appetitive external stimuli.Animal studies have established that the brain s opioid and endocannabinoid systems are important in regulating eating behavior and mediate the food reward experience. For instance, alterations in these systems  signaling have been associated with obesity. In general, both internal signals of the body, such as fluctuation in blood sugar levels, and external stimuli, such as food advertisements, can spark an appetite in humans.In their new study, researchers at the University of Turku, Finland, investigated the connection between the brain s opioid and endocannabinoid signaling and different types of eating behavior. They discovered that the function of the opioid system is connected to eating triggered by external stimuli. The less binding sites there were for the opioids, the greater was the tendency to eat in response to external stimuli, such as seeing appetizing food. Moreover, the number of binding sites for endocannabinoids was connected to several different types of eating behavior, describes first author,  Doctoral Candidate Tatu Kantonen from the University of Turku.According to Kantonen, the results indicate that especially the opioid system could be a potential target for anti-obesity drugs in humans.The research data was obtained from the AIVO database hosted by the Turku PET Centre.Reference: Kantonen T, Karjalainen T, Pekkarinen L, et al.

The study, which was published July 22 in Oncogene, is the most recent example of team science at Hollings. The work is the first time we are aware of that someone has shown how a checkpoint inhibitor is regulated due to loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene function,  said Raymond N. DuBois, M.D., Ph.D., director of Hollings Cancer Center and a senior author of the study.Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although colonoscopy screening is an effective way to detect and prevent colorectal cancer by polyp removal, colorectal cancer continues to be responsible for significant mortality. DuBois said existing therapies have limited efficacy for long-term survival in patients with stage 4 disease. The five-year survival rate for these patients is unacceptable, between 5% and 15%, which underscores the importance of this research,  DuBois said.The DuBois lab team has been working to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause colorectal cancer initiation, growth and progression to discover new strategies for prevention and interception.Immune response to cancer is regulated by a balance between co-stimulatory and inhibitory (checkpoint) pathways. Immune checkpoints put brakes on the immune system, preventing inflammatory tissue damage and autoimmune diseases. For example, one immune checkpoint pathway is activated by PD-L1, an immune system regulatory molecule that suppresses immune responses when it interacts with its receptor, PD-1. PD-L1 levels are elevated in a variety of human cancers, including colorectal cancer, and this sometimes leads to a poor prognosis,  DuBois said.  We know that high levels of PD-L1 on the surface of cancer cells are related to the tumor s ability to evade the immune system. However, the exact role PD-L1 plays in colorectal cancer is unclear. Some reports in the literature present conflicting results as to whether the presence of PD-L1 is indicative of a better or worse cancer prognosis. ","Published: September 3, 2021"

CAR T cells need to recognize a specific target on cancer cells to kill them. However, cancer cells do not always have the target, or they find ways to hide the target and stay invisible to CAR T cell attack. A new study from Penn Medicine, published online in Cell, demonstrates that RN7SL1, a naturally occurring RNA, can activate the body s own natural T cells to seek out the cancer cells that have escaped recognition by CAR T cells. This may help improve efforts to treat solid tumors, which represent most human cancers. CAR T cells typically are like lone soldiers without backup. However, if given the right tools, they can kickstart the body s own immune system and give them help against the cancer cells missed with CAR T cells alone,  said co-lead author Andy J. Minn, MD, PhD, a professor of Radiation Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Mark Foundation Center for Immunotherapy, Immune Signaling, and Radiation at Penn.The first tool is an endogenous RNA, or RNA originating from the body s own cells, called RN7SL1. However, when delivered to a tumor by CAR T cells, RN7SL1 mimics a viral RNA. Just like after a virus infection, an arm of the body s immune system called innate immune cells wakes up after seeing RN7SL1 delivered by CAR T cells. These innate immune cells can now function to stimulate the body s T cells, mobilizing them to join the attack on cancer. However, as with CAR T cells, the body s natural T cells also need a target on cancer cells to recognize and attack. Therefore, the second tool provided by the CAR T cells are foreign antigens, which get  painted  on the surface of cancer cells, essentially marking them for killing by the natural T cells. Using mouse models, the researchers showed that arming CAR T cells with this one-two punch to recruit the body s own immune system prevents tumor relapse even when many of the cancer cells cannot be recognized and killed by the CAR T cells alone. Therefore, engineering CAR T cells to deliver RN7SL1 and foreign antigens may help to combat common ways that solid tumors escape CAR T cells, hence improving efficacy.Besides helping to recruit the body s natural immune system, the study shows that RN7SL1 can improve the function of CAR T cells themselves. CAR T cells that express RN7SL1 have the additional advantages of persisting longer, infiltrating tumors better, and retaining greater function against tumors. Strategies that simultaneously employ CAR T cells, enhance endogenous T cell function and counteract common suppressive mechanisms may offer effective combinatorial approaches to improve solid tumor responses,  said co-lead author Carl H. June, MD, the Richard W. Vague Professor in Immunotherapy in the department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania.Reference: Johnson LR, Lee DY, Eacret JS, Ye D, June CH, Minn AJ.

The research team s ultimate aim is to develop therapies for people coping with rheumatoid arthritis, a debilitating condition that affects about 1.3 million adults in the United States. Doctors often treat patients who have rheumatoid arthritis with injections or infusions of anti-inflammatory biologic drugs, but those drugs can cause significant side effects when delivered long enough and at high enough doses to have beneficial effects,  said senior investigator Farshid Guilak, PhD, the Mildred B. Simon Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery.  We used CRISPR technology to reprogram the genes in stem cells. Then we created a small cartilage implant by seeding the cells on woven scaffolds, and we placed them under the skin of mice. The approach allows those cells to remain in the body for a long time and secrete a drug whenever there is a flare of inflammation. The new findings are published online Sept. 1 in the journal Science Advances.The researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to make cells that secrete a biologic drug in response to inflammation. The drug reduces inflammation in joints by binding to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a substance that often promotes inflammation in arthritis by activating inflammatory cells in a joint.Guilak, a co-director of the Washington University Center of Regenerative Medicine, and his team previously developed scaffolding that they coat with stem cells and then implant into joints to form cartilage. The strategy allows the researchers to implant the engineered cartilage cells in such a way that they don t drift away after a few days and can survive for months or longer.His lab also previously built so-called SMART cartilage cells (Stem cells Modified for Autonomous Regenerative Therapy) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to alter genes in those cells so that when the genes in the cartilage are activated by inflammation, they secrete drugs in response.In the new study, Guilak s team combined the strategies to provide treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. The cells sit under the skin or in a joint for months, and when they sense an inflammatory environment, they are programmed to release a biologic drug,  said Guilak, also director of research at Shriners Hospitals for Children   St. Louis.In this case, the drug was similar to the immunosuppressant drug anakinra, which binds to IL-1 and blocks its activity. Interestingly, that drug isn t used frequently to treat rheumatoid arthritis because it has a short half-life and doesn t linger in the body for long. But in this study in mice, the drug reduced inflammation and prevented bone damage often seen in rheumatoid arthritis. We focused on bone erosion because that is a big problem for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not effectively treated by current biologics  said co-first author Yunrak Choi, MD, a visiting orthopedic surgeon in the Guilak lab.  We used imaging techniques to closely examine bones in the animals, and we found that this approach prevented bone erosion. We re very excited about this advance, which seems to meet an important unmet clinical need. Guilak collaborated with Christine Pham, MD, director of the Division of Rheumatology and the Guy and Ella Mae Magness Professor of Medicine. Although biologics have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory arthritis, the continuous administration of these drugs often leads to adverse events, including an increased risk of infection,  Pham explained.  The idea of delivering such drugs essentially on demand in response to arthritis flares is extremely attractive to those of us who work with arthritis patients, because the approach could limit the adverse effects that accompany continuous high-dose administration of these drugs. With CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, cells have the potential to be programmed to make all sorts of drugs, meaning that if one arthritis drug works better than another in a particular patient, the researchers could engineer cartilage cells to make personalized treatments. The strategy has great potential to treat other inflammatory arthritis conditions, including juvenile arthritis, a condition that affects more than 300,000 children in the United States. Many arthritis patients have to self-administer these drugs, giving themselves injections daily, weekly or biweekly, while others go to a doctor s office every few months to receive an infusion of one of these biologics, but in this study, we ve demonstrated that we can make living tissue into a drug-delivery system,  said Kelsey H. Collins, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate in Guilak s lab and co-first author of the study.  These cells can sense problems and respond by producing a drug. This approach also helps us understand why certain biologics may have limited effects in inflammatory arthritis. It s not because they don t bind to the right target but likely because an injected drug is short-lived compared to the automatically controlled levels of drug released by implanted SMART cells. The researchers are continuing to experiment with CRISPR-Cas9 and stem cells, even engineering cells that might manufacture more than one drug to respond to different triggers for inflammation.Reference: Choi Y-R, Collins KH, Springer LE, et al.

Now, a new study using novel technology and the human connectome, a map of neural connections, has identified a brain circuit that seems to mediate that aspect of our personality. The work appears in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier.The study, led by Michael Ferguson, PhD, an investigator in the Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics at Brigham and Women s Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, shows that the brain circuitry of spirituality centers around a brainstem area called the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Patients routinely report that spiritual and religious experiences are among their most meaningful life events. Yet medical science historically has been shy about empirically studying the impacts of spirituality or its physiological mechanisms, Dr. Ferguson said. Now, we re at a moment of sufficient cultural openness in science coupled with threshold technological proficiency in brain mapping that we don t need to be so shy anymore about examining spirituality using our best scientific methods. Some people with neurological diseases such as schizophrenia experience hallucinations or ideations that are religious or spiritual in nature. And previous studies have shown that people with a certain type of epilepsy or with damage in specific brain areas could experience alterations in their spiritual identification. Earlier research has also indicated that religious experiences are not the product of one particular brain region   that there is no so-called  god spot    but that spirituality likely arises from dynamic activity across multiple brain regions.In order to map the newly found brain circuit, Dr. Ferguson and colleagues examined previously collected data about self-reported spirituality from 88 patients before and after undergoing surgery for a brain tumor. The researchers then used a technique called lesion network mapping to analyze how the site of each patient s lesion, or tumor, interacts with the rest of the brain using a connectome dataset. That analysis revealed the PAG as a critical hub to changes in spiritual identification. Dr. Ferguson and the team then confirmed the importance of the PAG by analyzing previously collected data from 105 veterans of the Vietnam War who experienced head trauma.The PAG is an evolutionarily old brain structure known for its roles in fear response behaviors and autonomic functions such as regulating heart rate. The PAG is perhaps best known (and most studied) for its role in dampening pain by triggering the release of endogenous opioids, the brain s own painkillers.Dr. Ferguson and his colleagues were surprised to find the spirituality circuitry centered on the PAG, rather than  higher  brain regions such as the cortex, which is usually associated with cognitive function and abstract thoughts.Dr. Ferguson added:  The fact that our results in this study point to such an evolutionarily ancient brainstem structure to define a circuit for spirituality is potentially significant for a litany of reasons. Among the more immediately material reasons is that the [PAG] is well-known to mediate pain inhibition. This leads to curiosity about ways that spirituality might be clinically relevant for helping manage physical and emotional pain. The fact that the [PAG] is also involved in attachment and bonding may also hint at mechanistic explanations for the emerging observation that spirituality can be effectively integrated into psychotherapy. These are of course early speculations about possible clinical relevance for the neuroscience of spirituality; the fact, though, that there is so much more work to do in this area is exhilarating and motivating! John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, said of the work: ""It is important to understand that this study does not suggest that religion or spirituality in healthy people are in any way abnormal. Rather, this study identifies circuits in the brain that enable us to have religious or spiritual experiences. Researchers have long believed these circuits to exist, because some mental and neurologic illnesses can be associated with alterations in religious experiences, such as religious hallucinations or delusions. However, the study by Dr. Ferguson and colleagues now maps the brain circuits involved in religious experience and spirituality with new precision.""Reference: Ferguson MA, Schaper FLWVJ, Cohen A, et al.

How such sex differences, known as sexual dimorphism, evolve is a puzzle because females and males share the same set of genes and an evolutionary change in one sex should cause a correlated change even in the other sex, thereby preventing sex differences from evolving.

However, their role in the disease remains partially unknown.Low-density granulocytes (LDG) are a type of neutrophils whose number has been observed to grow particularly in connection with certain autoimmune diseases and cancers, such as rheumatoid arthritis, melanoma, liver cancer and breast cancer. Increased levels of these granulocytes have also been associated with septicaemia, but their general role and functioning in infectious diseases are yet to be comprehensively described.The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the ensuing pandemic has demonstrated a need to investigate mechanisms of acute respiratory infections in more detail. In a recently completed study, researchers from the University of Helsinki studied LDG levels in patients suffering from acute covid-19. The goal was to determine the role, if any, of LDGs in the disease.The results were published in the PLOS PATHOGENS journal.A total of 34 hospitalised patients and 21 outpatients with mild symptoms were included in the study. The researchers used flow cytometry to measure LDG levels, detecting a significant increase in LDGs in the blood of acute covid-19 patients compared to healthy control subjects. LDGs are cells associated with the innate immune response, and they fight acute infections. However, their effect on the progression of covid-19 appears to take place through an inhibiting effect on the proliferation and division of T lymphocytes, consequently potentially suppressing part of the adaptive immune response against the virus,  says Luz Cabrera, doctoral student at the University of Helsinki.","Published: September 2, 2021"

The biological nervous system works by selective transport of electrically charged particles called ions through cell membranes. If manufactured membranes were able to achieve a similar ion selectivity, it could transform many technologies, including water purification, mineral extraction and energy storage. Achieving precise ion separation at the sub-nanometer level by polymer membranes is very challenging  says chemical engineer Zhiping Lai.Ions are formed when atoms or molecules lose or gain electrons, therefore gaining a positive or negative electrical charge. Those derived from single atoms, such as sodium (Na+), lithium (Li+) or chloride (Cl-) ions, are smaller than 1 nanometer (10-9 meters) across. The researchers used the known sizes of ions to conduct simulation studies, which helped identify suitable monomers that could act as the molecular units  needed to link into a conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) membrane structure.They then used a process called electropolymerization to make their polymer membranes. This process uses a cyclical electric current to control the precise structure that forms when the 1,3,5-tris(N-carbazolyl) benzene monomer molecules link together. It was challenging to determine the resulting pore size and level of porosity because of the asymmetric membrane structure,  says Lai, adding,  to overcome this issue we had to make hundreds of samples. The tiny size and nature of the pores prevented their analysis from using many common structural determination methods, but a solution was found in gas physisorption, which studies the interaction of a material with gases.In tests using solutions containing a range of ions, the membranes proved to have a selective ion-sieving performance superior to almost all other reported membranes. This demonstrates that our innovative polymer membranes have great potential in many energy- and environment-related ion separation processes,  says Zongyao Zhou. Removing ions from seawater to produce drinkable water is one obvious possibility. Rechargeable batteries and other energy storage systems also depend on controlling the movement of ions.Zhou says that the next target for the team is to explore the potential of the membranes to be used in a variety of innovative chemical sensors. Many chemicals of environmental or medical interest consist of ions. Membranes that selectively allow ions of interest to pass through the membranes could be used in a new generation of more precise and flexible sensor technology.Reference: Zhou Z, Guo D, Shinde DB, et al.

Two studies led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis describe the potential of liquid biopsies to identify and track tumor growth in two very different cancers: bladder cancer and peripheral nerve tumors. Despite the differences between these cancers and their associated biopsies, the studies demonstrate the possible benefits of this relatively new tool in the fight against cancer.Both studies appear in the Aug. 31 issue of PLOS Medicine, which is a special issue of the journal dedicated to liquid biopsies.One study reports the development of a urine biopsy to monitor bladder cancer. With an easy to collect urine sample, doctors could determine whether the initial treatment eradicated the cancer or left some remnants of disease behind. That knowledge could lead to fewer patients undergoing unnecessary surgeries. The second study describes a blood biopsy to diagnose a tumor of the sheath   or lining   that covers peripheral nerves. This rare cancer is caused by an inherited genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). In patients with NF1, it is difficult to determine whether tumors developing in the nerve sheath are benign or malignant. Our studies demonstrate ways that cancer management could improve with liquid biopsies that accurately diagnose and monitor tumors at various stages of the disease,  said Aadel A. Chaudhuri, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of radiation oncology and the senior author of both papers. Chaudhuri also treats patients at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. For bladder cancer, if a urine biopsy can detect whether the early chemotherapy totally eradicated the tumor, it could help some patients avoid major surgery to remove the bladder,  he said.  And for NF1, if we can distinguish between tumors that are cancerous versus precancerous, we open the door to early cancer detection in hereditary conditions that predispose people to developing cancer. Patients with bladder cancer that has invaded the underlying muscle typically undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the bladder. Bladder removal, which also can include removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles for men, and removal of the uterus, ovaries and part of the vagina for women, reduces the risk of the cancer returning. But some patients may respond well to the initial chemotherapy and not need to have the bladder or nearby organs removed. Unfortunately, there is no way today to identify which patients may not need to undergo bladder removal, a procedure that  has a major impact on quality of life. The urine biopsy that Chaudhuri and his colleagues have implemented could, in the future, be a way to determine which patients may safely avoid bladder removal.In the study, the researchers analyzed the DNA found in the urine of healthy people and patients with bladder cancer treated with chemotherapy. After chemotherapy but before surgery to remove the bladder, the scientists were able to identify, in cancer patients  urine, residual tumor DNA that otherwise would go undetected. All patients underwent surgery to remove the bladder. The researchers found tumor DNA in the urine of patients whose bladders later were found to still show remaining tumor, even after chemotherapy. In contrast, those patients who had so-called complete responses to the chemotherapy   no evidence of tumors remaining in the bladder after it was surgically removed   also showed no tumor DNA in their urine prior to surgery.While the test is not yet sensitive enough to guide treatment decisions, Chaudhuri said the study paves the way for further refinement of the test toward the goal of identifying patients who can keep their bladders after chemotherapy.Co-corresponding authors on the urine biopsy for bladder cancer are Vivek K. Arora, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine; and Zachary L. Smith, MD, an assistant professor of surgery, both at Washington University School of Medicine. The co-first authors are Pradeep S. Chauhan, PhD, a staff scientist; Kevin Chen, a medical student; Ramandeep K. Babbra, MD, a research assistant; and Wenjia Feng, a research assistant, all in Chaudhuri s lab.Patients with NF1 are predisposed to developing cancer, and peripheral nerve sheath tumors are the most common cause of death for such patients. These cancers usually stem from benign tumors, and it s often difficult to distinguish between the benign and malignant forms of these tumors.Chaudhuri teamed with Angela Hirbe, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Medical Oncology and director of the Adult NF Clinical Program, and Jack Shern, MD, the Lasker Clinical Research Scholar in the Pediatric Oncology Branch at the National Cancer Institute s Center for Cancer Research. Together, they developed a method to analyze the DNA in a blood sample that can distinguish between healthy individuals, NF1 patients with benign tumors and NF1 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The DNA analysis also correlated with how well the patients responded to treatment.In the future, the liquid biopsy could help doctors determine when benign tumors in NF1 patients become malignant, improving early cancer detection and early treatment in patients at high risk of developing cancer.The co-first authors of this study are Jeffrey J. Szymanski, MD, PhD, a bioinformatics scientist at Washington University, and R. Taylor Sundby, MD, of the National Cancer Institute s Center for Cancer Research.While these two liquid biopsies demonstrate the utility and versatility of the technology for vastly different tumors, Chaudhuri is expanding his team s research beyond cancer. He recently received a five-year, $1.97 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a liquid biopsy to diagnose and monitor sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection that triggers inflammation throughout the body.Reference: Chauhan PS, Chen K, Babbra RK, et al.

The research team assessed a range of factors, including age, frailty and areas of deprivation and compared that with post-vaccination infection.The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that in the unlikely event of catching COVID-19 after being double vaccinated, the risk of Long COVID was reduced by almost half. There were also fewer hospitalisations (73% less likely) and lower burden of acute symptoms (31% less likely) among those fully vaccinated. The nature of the most common symptoms were similar to unvaccinated adults   e.g. anosmia,(loss of smell) cough, fever, headaches, and fatigue. All these symptoms were milder and less frequently reported by people who were vaccinated, and they were half as likely to get multiple symptoms in the first week of illness. Sneezing was the only symptom which was more commonly reported in vaccinated people with COVID-19.However, people living in most deprived areas were at greater risk of infection after a single vaccination. While age on its own was not a risk factor, individuals who had health conditions that limited their independence   such as frailty - were up to two times more likely to contract COVID-19 infection after vaccination, and of getting sick.The findings demonstrate the need to target at-risk groups. Frail adults have already been shown to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The research team suggests strategies such as a timely booster programme, targeted infection control measures and more research into the immune response to vaccination in this group could help address the issue. Professor Tim Spector from King s College London and Lead investigator of ZOE COVID Study comments:  Vaccinations are massively reducing the chances of people getting Long COVID in two ways. Firstly, by reducing the risk of any symptoms by 8 to 10 fold and then by halving the chances of any infection turning into Long COVID, if it does happen. Whatever the duration of symptoms we are seeing that infections after two vaccinations are also much milder, so vaccines are really changing the disease and for the better. We are encouraging people to get their 2nd jab as soon as they can. Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid said: ""COVID-19 vaccines have saved more than 105,000 lives and prevented over 24 million infections in England alone. This research is encouraging, suggesting vaccines are not only preventing deaths but could also help prevent some of the longer lasting symptoms.  We have invested  50 million in research to better understand the lasting effects of COVID and over 80 long COVID assessment services have opened across England as part of a  100 million expansion of care for those suffering the effects.

The discovery provides new insights into the behavior of engineered nanomaterials and how they can be better designed for numerous commercial applications without impacting the environment or human health. Nanomaterials are ubiquitous in our world today and can be found in common products such as our sunscreens, cosmetics and clothing,  said Dr. Danmeng Shuai, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the George Washington University who co-led the study.  Every day, new nanomaterials are being considered for commercial use, but do we really understand how these materials break down in the environment and the implications? Our study suggests there s more to learn before setting loose another nanomaterial in the world.  With support from the National Science Foundation s Environmental Chemical Sciences program and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, researchers at GW, American University, the United States Naval Academy and University of Illinois at Chicago examined graphitic carbon nitride, an emerging engineered nanomaterial that has been extensively considered for water treatment, air purification, antimicrobials, energy storage, electronics, biomedical therapy and more. The nanomaterial was previously believed to be highly stable and only decomposed in the presence of hydroxyl radicals, the most powerful oxidant in water. The research team, however, found that the nanomaterial s decomposition by hydroxyl radicals was also affected by light: the nanomaterial breaks down rapidly when exposed to light, but decomposes slowly in the absence of light. According to the researchers, this should raise concerns about the perceived stability of the nanomaterial and industry s potential use of it.  Our study highlights how engineered nanomaterials might persist or degrade in the environment as well as their potential toxicity,  Mengqiao Li, a doctoral student in civil and environmental engineering at GW and first author of the study, said.  It also highlights where more research is needed to guide the design of future nanomaterials that are more stable and don t harm the environment.  Mengqiao recently received the C. Ellen Gonter Environmental Chemistry Award for this study, a prestigious award provided by American Chemical Society Division of Environmental Chemistry.ReferenceLi M, Liu D, Chen X, et al.

In his book, he noted that an  unconscious  part of the brain enables us to process information spontaneously, when, for example, meeting someone for the first time, interviewing someone for a job, or faced with making a decision quickly under stress.Now, a new study from the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) suggests that there may be a biological basis behind this instantaneous compatibility reaction. A team of researchers showed that variations of an enzyme found in a part of the brain that regulates mood and motivation seems to control which mice want to socially interact with other mice   with the genetically similar mice preferring each other.The UMSOM researchers, led by Michy Kelly, PhD, Associate Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology, say their findings may indicate that similar factors could contribute to the social choices people make.

This work may help usher in a more sustainable future with widely available cultured meat. Wagyu can be literally translated into  Japanese cow,  and is famous around the globe for its high content of intramuscular fat, known as marbling or sashi. This marbling provides the beef its rich flavors and distinctive texture. However, the way cattle are raised today is often considered to be unsustainable in light of its outsized contribution to climate emissions. Currently, the available  cultured meat  alternatives only consist primarily of poorly organized muscle fiber cells that fail to reproduce the complex structure of real beef steaks.Now, a team of scientists led by Osaka University have used 3D-Printing to create synthetic meat that looks more like the real thing.  Using the histological structure of Wagyu beef as a blueprint, we have developed a 3D-printing method that can produce tailor-made complex structures, like muscle fibers, fat, and blood vessels,  lead author Dong-Hee Kang says. To overcome this challenge, the team started with two types of stem cells, called bovine satellite cells and adipose-derived stem cells. Under the right laboratory conditions, these  multipotent  cells can be coaxed to differentiate into every type of cell needed to produce the cultured meat. Individual fibers including muscle, fat, or blood vessels were fabricated from these cells using bioprinting. The fibers were then arranged in 3D, following the histological structure, to reproduce the structure of the real Wagyu meat, which was finally sliced perpendicularly, in a similar way to the traditional Japanese candy Kintaro-ame. This process made the reconstruction of the complex meat tissue structure possible in a customizable manner.  By improving this technology, it will be possible to not only reproduce complex meat structures, such as the beautiful sashi of Wagyu beef, but to also make subtle adjustments to the fat and muscle components,  senior author Michiya Matsusaki says. That is, customers would be able to order cultured meat with their desired amount of fat, based on taste and health considerations.ReferenceKang D-H, Louis F, Liu H, et al.

A Chinese research team has now developed a novel form of photodynamic tumor therapy for the treatment of deep tumors that works without external irradiation. The light source is built into the drug and is  switched on  selectively in the microenvironment of tumors, as they report in the journal Angewandte Chemie.Classic photodynamic therapy is a noninvasive cancer treatment that is relatively gentle because of its specific spatial and temporal selectivity. To start with, a photosensitizer is administered, then the region where the tumor is located is irradiated with light. The photosensitizer is excited by the light and transfers some of the absorbed energy to oxygen molecules, resulting in reactive oxygen species that destroy tumor cells. Because of the limited depth of penetration of the necessary visible or UV light in tissues, this method is only useful for shallow tumors.A team led by Xiaolian Sun (China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing) and Guoqiang Shao (Nanjing Medical University) has now developed a new photodynamic tumor therapy that works for deep tumors. It does not need external irradiation because the photosensitizer brings its own  lamp  along and  switches it on  on its own once it reaches the tumor.This  intelligent  drug consists of four components linked into a single molecule: a photosensitizer (pyropheophorbide-a), a pH sensor (diisopropylamino group), a polymer (polyethylene glycol), and the  lamp  (the amino acid tyrosine carrying a radioactive iodine-131 isotope). At the pH values found in healthy tissues, the molecules are tightly aggregated into nanoparticles. In this compact form, the  irradiation  is switched off (quenched) and the drug has no effect. However, tumorous tissue has a somewhat more acidic pH value. This environment causes the pH sensor to change structure, and the nanoparticles fall apart the irradiation is switched on, and reactive oxygen species are formed that kill the tumor cells.How does this  built-in light  work? As it decays, the radioactive iodine isotope I-131 releases  -radiation (electrons) and  -radiation. As the electrons move, their charges polarize atoms, thereby causing dipole oscillations that send out electromagnetic waves, which means light. Usually, these waves cancel one another immediately. Yet, in the dense aqueous environment of the cells (other than in vacuo), the electrons sent out by I-131 are faster than light. In this case, the quenching of the waves is incomplete, resulting in a bluish light known as Cherenkov radiation. This excites the photosensitizers enough to destroy tumor cells. In cell cultures and animal models, the new drug demonstrated powerful tumor inhibition with low toxicity and minimal side effects on healthy tissue.Reference: Guo J, Feng K, Wu W, et al.

In a preliminary study, researchers in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology Letters report that organophosphate esters (OPEs) were found in water dispensed from these systems, but they estimated that daily consumption would be far below the levels associated with health problems.As drinking water from freestanding dispensers has become wildly popular, some concern has been raised about the quality of the water coming out of these systems. For example, OPEs have been found in various types of drinking water, including tap, well and bottled water, in some locations in the U.S., South Korea and China. These compounds are used widely worldwide, replacing harmful brominated flame retardants and as additives in plastics, and now researchers are finding that OPEs are also associated with poor health outcomes. Because these substances are applied to materials or used as additives, which are not strongly bonded to plastic polymers, they can easily contaminate dust or leach into water. So, Yali Shi, Guangshui Na and colleagues wanted to see if water dispensers could contribute to OPE exposure, estimating the amount someone would consume on a daily basis if they only drank water from these types of systems. The researchers collected water from 53 water dispensers in office buildings in China, both from the storage tanks and dispensed through room temperature and hot water taps. They analyzed the samples for 22 OPEs and detected eight of them in the majority of samples, with tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) being the most abundant. The water dispensed from the hot and room temperature taps had higher amounts of these compounds than water held in the tanks. Upon closer inspection, the researchers found that the plastic dispenser and the tubing contained these compounds, and the tubing could accumulate OPEs from the air. Finally, the team calculated that if people drank water dispensed solely from these systems, their total daily exposure to TCIPP   a potential carcinogen and endocrine disruptor   was far less than is considered to cause harm to humans. The researchers say that while their study was small, it identifies a need for future research to examine whether silicone is the most suitable tubing material for watercoolers.ReferenceHou M, Shi Y, Na G, Zhao Z, Cai Y.

The Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine, given during early childhood, and Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, given every 10 years, are known to elicit a protective response against the diseases from which the vaccines get their names. But these vaccines may have an unexpected bonus: It s possible that they also elicit cross-reactive memory T cells capable of responding to protein targets called antigens that are present in other microbes that cause diseases   including the viral antigens in SARS-CoV-2. The concept is that pre-existing memory T cells generated by prior MMR or Tdap vaccination and activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection give the immune system a head start in responding to SARS-CoV-2, thereby lowering the risk of severe COVID-19.To investigate whether the MMR and Tdap vaccines provide additional protection against COVID-19, researchers at Brigham and Women s Hospital conducted laboratory-based analyses using sensitive, new techniques to detect and characterize T cell responses to antigens. They applied these techniques to measure the response of T cells isolated from the blood of COVID-19 convalescent patients and patients vaccinated against COVID-19 to antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and the MMR and Tdap vaccines. Teaming up with collaborators at Cleveland Clinic, they also leveraged a large, well-annotated cohort of COVID-19 patients and found that prior MMR or Tdap vaccination was associated with decreased disease severity. Their results are published in Med. Our Cleveland Clinic colleagues observed an association where individuals with COVID-19 who had either MMR or Tdap vaccines had a much lower frequency of going to the intensive care unit or dying,  said co-author Andrew Lichtman, MD, PhD, an immunologist and senior investigator in the Brigham s Department of Pathology and professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.  Although previous smaller studies suggested a similar link, our in-depth epidemiological analyses, together with our basic research results, suggest that these commonly given vaccines may protect against severe disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that there was a marked decline in routine vaccinations for children and adolescents,  said corresponding author Tanya Mayadas, PhD, a senior scientist in the Brigham s Department of Pathology and professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.  Our findings emphasize the importance of routine vaccination for children and adults. We know vaccines protect against devastating diseases, and we re now seeing growing evidence that some of them provide a degree of protection against severe COVID-19 disease. The team s investigation was jumpstarted by an unexpected observation. Mayadas, her postdoctoral fellow Vijaya Mysore, PhD, and colleagues noted in laboratory experiments using COVID-19 convalescent blood that whenever they observed a heightened T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, they also saw a heightened response to proteins from MMR and Tdap, which they had been using as controls. This was observed with both COVID-19 convalescent and uninfected individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. This connection was made by the team s use of highly efficient antigen-presenting cells (described in a recently published Nature Communications paper) derived from blood, loaded with SARS-CoV-2, MMR or Tdap antigens, and co-cultured with T  cells from the same individual. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of T cell antigen receptors, the team observed that the antigen receptors on many of the T cells from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 that responded to proteins from SARS-CoV-2 (Spike-S1 and Nucleocapsid) were identical to the antigen receptors on T cells that responded to MMR and Tdap proteins. This discovery indicated the presence of T cell clones that can respond to both SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the MMR and Tdap vaccine antigens.In a second analysis, Mayadas and colleagues teamed up with investigators at Cleveland Clinic to examine the epidemiological evidence. The Cleveland Clinic team performed a retrospective cohort study using data from more than 75,000 patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio or Florida who had tested positive for COVID-19 between March 8, 2020, and March 31, 2021. The team used a statistical method known as overlap propensity score weighting to compare two disease severity outcomes (COVID-related hospitalization and COVID-related admission to the intensive care unit or death) for patients who had been vaccinated against MMR or Tdap and those who had not. They found that patients who had previously been vaccinated for MMR had a 38 percent decrease in hospitalization and a 32 percent decrease in ICU admission/death. Similarly, patients previously vaccinated for Tdap had 23 percent and 20 percent decreased rates, respectively, of these outcomes. Beyond learning about the potential benefits of the MMR and Tdap vaccines in the context of COVID-19, this study provides a blueprint for accelerating research,  said co-author Lara Jehi, MD, MHCDS, Chief Research Information Officer of the Cleveland Clinic Health System.  Biomedical hypotheses generated in the laboratory can be explored through robust clinical and epidemiological research in well-curated, real-world data such as the Cleveland Clinic COVID Registry. Knowledge learned through this collaboration is much more than the sum of our individual parts. The authors note that while their laboratory-based findings are strengthened by the epidemiological observations, further work is needed to assess the association between the MMR and Tdap vaccinations and severity of COVID-19 disease to determine if the relationship is a causal one. Prospective studies of vaccination and patient outcomes may help distinguish correlation from causation. With regards to COVID-19 vaccines, our findings predict that although MMR and Tdap are not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccines they may afford greater and more durable protection, possibly against emerging spike variants than the COVID-19 vaccine alone,  said Mayadas.  And in areas where the COVID-19 vaccines are not available, they could protect infected individuals from developing severe disease. Reference: Mysore V, Cullere X, Settles ML, et al.

Although most patients improve with medical care, more than half the MIS-C cases in the U.S. require ICU admission, and the condition can be deadly.A total of 4,404 MIS-C cases and 37 fatalities in the U.S. had been reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Aug. 15. The median age of MIS-C patients was 9 years, and more than 60% of the cases were in Black or Latinx children, according to the report.""It is crucial to improve our understanding of MIS-C in the current environment, given reports of rising rates of children being hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. and the return of many students to school for the fall term,"" said Moshe Arditi, MD, director of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Division at Cedars-Sinai. ""The disproportionate impact of MIS-C related to race and ethnicity is especially troubling.""Arditi, professor of pediatrics and the GUESS?/Fashion Industries Guild Chair in Community Child Health, is co-senior author of the new study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Investigation. The other co-senior authors are Jennifer Van Eyk, PhD, director of the Advanced Clinical Biosystems Research Institute in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai, and Mascha Binder, MD, from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany.The investigators examined a small group of patients to identify an array of pathogenic pathways culminating in MIS-C, along with proteins in the blood with potential to act as biomarkers to forecast the severity of the syndrome and help drive treatment decisions.A picture is emerging of MIS-C as an autoimmune disease in which the immune system becomes overactive and mistakenly attacks the body's own organs, Arditi explained. This process may be triggered by widespread tissue damage caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.Children with MIS-C often present symptoms similar to those observed in the so-called cytokine storm, an inflammatory response that can be fatal in COVID-19 patients. These symptoms may include persistent fever and gastrointestinal, respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular problems, such as shock and heart muscle inflammation.Research co-led by Arditi and his team and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, published last year, uncovered similar biological processes involved in MIS-C, the cytokine storm and toxic shock syndrome a rare, life-threatening complication of bacterial infections. These findings were further elucidated earlier this year in two peer-reviewed studies co-authored by Arditi.For the new Journal of Clinical Investigation study, the research team adopted an interdisciplinary approach, marshaling specialists across Cedars-Sinai and five other institutions.""We deployed an array of advanced techniques, including proteomics, RNA sequencing and analyses of antibodies and immune system signaling,"" said Van Eyk, professor of Cardiology, Biomedical Sciences and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and an expert on proteomics the study of proteins at the molecular and genetic levels. ""By combining forces, we are better able to accelerate scientific discoveries to keep pace with the rapidly evolving pandemic and to inform clinical decisions.""The investigators noted that their study was limited by its small size. They examined 69 children, including those with and without MIS-C and seven with another pediatric inflammatory disorder Kawasaki disease. Future investigations are needed to validate the findings in a larger patient group, Arditi said.Reference: Porritt RA, Binek A, Paschold L, et al.

The study highlights the importance of meninges for brain development and pathology.The brain is one of the most complex organs, and it controls essential functions in our day-to-day lives. Therefore, any harm or injury to the brain can have lasting effects, and can even be fatal. The infant s brain is even more susceptible than adult brains, and this is especially the case for preterm infants given the fact that their brains are still under development.The meninges surround the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS) to protect neuronal cells from the changeable milieu of the bloodstream by controlling the movements of molecules and cells between the blood and the CNS. These barriers also ensure that the CNS can be kept under surveillance by certain immune cells while at the same time restricting the access of blood-derived immune cells and molecules to specific compartments at the border of the CNS.In the new study, published in Genes & Development, the researchers used experimental model and provided a detailed immune landscape of meningeal tissue at early stages of development under both physiological and pathological conditions.Xiaoyang Wang, Professor at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg:  We showed that the neonatal meninges contain almost all known types of immune cells, along with novel immune cell subtypes in the developing meninges that we have characterized for the first time.

Now University of Guelph food scientists say they have found a way to create that perfect chocolate that simplifies the traditional  tempering  process of repeatedly heating and cooling chocolate.In a world first, a team led by food scientist Dr. Alejandro Marangoni discovered that adding a key component in cocoa butter fat to melted chocolate helps to hold it together and give it an ideal structure, simply and inexpensively.Their discovery, which appears in the journal Nature Communications, could revolutionize how chocolate is made.Creating chocolate that is glossy and snaps perfectly when broken is not easy. It requires  tempering    a time-consuming process in which chocolate makers slowly heat and cool melted chocolate repeatedly to coax the fatty acid crystals in the cocoa butter into one stable form. If you ve ever eaten bad chocolate, you ll know it right away. It s crumbly and grainy and soft. That is chocolate that has not been properly tempered,  said Marangoni, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Food, Health and Aging.Typically, chocolate makers will employ  seeding  during the tempering process to encourage the chocolate to crystallize. The  seed  is often chunks or grated bits of already-tempered chocolate that act like magnets to attract loose crystals of fatty acids into line. A good chocolatier can do this by eye. Their experience tells them when the chocolate is ready, and they can make adjustments when it s not. But that can t be done in large-scale chocolate manufacturing,  said Marangoni.Chocolate manufacturers use specialized equipment called tempering units, but even those aren t foolproof, and manufacturers often find large variabilities between batches of cocoa butter.Marangoni sought to make the process simpler by finding an ingredient that could more easily help form the correct crystal structure.Along with research associate Dr. Saeed Ghazani, chemistry student Jay Chen and Canadian Light Source plant imaging lead Jarvis Stobbs, he tested several  minor components  naturally present in cocoa butter and selected a specific molecule, a saturated phospholipid, to  seed  the formation of proper cocoa butter crystals.Adding the phospholipid to melted chocolate and then rapidly cooling it once to 20 C accelerated crystallization without the need for tempering, the team found. The resulting chocolate had an optimal microstructure, with the ideal surface gloss and strength.The researchers were able to confirm their finding by visiting the Canadian Light Source at the University of Saskatchewan, where Stobbs is also a beam line scientist.The facility s synchrotron technology and bright light   millions of times brighter than the sun   allowed the team to get micrograph images of the interior microstructure of their chocolate in full detail and confirm the positive effect their ingredient had on the chocolate structure. It s exciting that you could just add a phospholipid   a natural component already present in the cocoa butter   to achieve the required tempering,  Marangoni said.By potentially eliminating the need for complex tempering machines, he said,  this could revolutionize the industry and allow smaller manufacturers to produce chocolate without a big capital investment on machinery.

This kind of research could help answer questions about neurological diseases or disorders like Parkinson's disease or stroke. But identifying and predicting animal behavior is extremely difficult.Now, a new unsupervised machine learning algorithm developed by Yttri and Alex Hsu, a biological sciences Ph.D. candidate in his lab, makes studying behavior much easier and more accurate. The researchers published a paper on the new tool, B-SOiD (Behavioral segmentation of open field in DeepLabCut), in ""Nature Communications.""Previously, the standard method to capture animal behavior was to track very simple actions, like whether a trained mouse pressed a lever or whether an animal was eating food or not. Alternatively, the experimenter could spend hours and hours manually identifying behavior, usually frame by frame on a video, a process prone to human error and bias.Hsu realized he could let an unsupervised learning algorithm do the time-consuming work. B-SOiD discovers behaviors by identifying patterns in the position of an animal's body. The algorithm works with computer vision software and can tell researchers what behavior is happening at every frame in a video.""It uses an equation to consistently determine when a behavior starts,"" Hsu explained. ""Once you reach that threshold, the behavior is identified, every time. A human experimenter might toggle between two frames or several categories, try to decide where behavior begins and become fatigued over time.""Yttri said B-SOiD provides a huge improvement and opens up several avenues for new research.""It removes user bias and, more importantly, removes the time cost and arduous work,"" he said. ""We can accurately process hours of data in a matter of minutes."" Additionally, B-SOiD is very user friendly and openly available to any researcher. Yttri's lab and their collaborators have used the new algorithm in research on many important areas, including research to better understand chronic pain, obsessive compulsive disorder and more.Collaborators have even begun to use B-SOiD to study human movement in Parkinson's disease. ""We are beginning to see if this can be used as part of an objective test by a doctor to show how far a patient's disease has progressed. The hope is that a patient anywhere in the world would be diagnosed with one standardized metric,"" Yttri said. This is a breakthrough in how scientists can study natural behavior and how it changes rather than the overly simplistic or subjective measures that predominate neuroscience and ethology.

The Phase 2b proof-of-concept study, which began in November 2017, enrolled 2,637 women ages 18 to 35 years from five countries.The Imbokodo primary analysis was conducted 24 months after participants received their first vaccinations. The study s primary endpoint was based on the difference in the number of new HIV infections between the placebo and vaccine groups from month seven (one month after the third vaccination timepoint) through month 24. When comparing the number of new HIV infections between study participants who were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or the investigational vaccine, statisticians found that 63 participants who received the placebo and 51 participants who received the experimental vaccine acquired HIV infection. Therefore, the investigational vaccine s efficacy was 25.2% (95% confidence interval of vaccine efficacy -10.5% to 49.3%). The study vaccine was found to be safe with no serious adverse events associated with it. Study participants are being informed of the findings and will have follow-up visits with the study investigators. Further analysis of the Imbokodo study will continue, and the study is thought to have provided sufficient data for further immunological correlates research.The Imbokodo study, also known as HVTN 705/HPX2008, is sponsored by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. It is funded by two primary partners, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection has proven to be a formidable scientific challenge,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  Although this is certainly not the study outcome for which we had hoped, we must apply the knowledge learned from the Imbokodo trial and continue our efforts to find a vaccine that will be protective against HIV. The investigational vaccine tested in the Imbokodo study is based on  mosaic  immunogens vaccine components designed to induce immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains. The vaccine candidate used a strain of common-cold virus (adenovirus serotype 26, or Ad26), engineered to not cause illness, to deliver four (quadrivalent) mosaic antigens to spur an immune response. Earlier research indicated the vaccine was both well-tolerated and could induce an anti-HIV immune response. Imbokodo participants received four vaccinations during a one-year period. This included four doses of the investigational quadrivalent vaccine. The final two doses were administered together with doses of an HIV protein, clade C gp140, and an adjuvant to boost immune responses. Participants were followed for at least two years. The primary analysis occurred one year after the last study participant s final vaccination.Study participants were offered pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV infection during the clinical trial. The women who acquired HIV infection were directed to medical care and offered antiretroviral treatment.NIAID provided funding for preclinical and early phase clinical development of the investigational mosaic HIV vaccine, which was initially developed by the laboratory of Dan H. Barouch, M.D., Ph.D., at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, together with Janssen and other partners. The mosaic immunogens used in the experimental vaccine were designed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Imbokodo study was conducted by the NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Additional support for the trial was provided by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command; and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. The South African Medical Research Council helped to implement the study in South Africa.In addition to its primary review of the Imbokodo study, the partners in consultation with an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) determined that a complementary Phase 3 HIV vaccine study called Mosaico (HVTN 706/HPX3002) should continue. That clinical trial is testing the safety and efficacy of a different investigational HIV vaccine among a different patient population (men who have sex with men and transgender populations) and in different geographical locations (the Americas and Europe) than the Imbokodo trial. The Mosaico study is estimated to be completed in March 2024.This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

Researchers have been using the instruments for many years to explore the world of nanoscopic phenomena. A new approach by physicists at Forschungszentrum J lich is now creating new possibilities for using the devices to study quantum effects. Thanks to magnetic cooling, their scanning tunnelling microscope works without any moving parts and is almost vibration-free at extremely low temperatures as low as 30 millikelvin. The instrument can help researchers unlock the exceptional properties of quantum materials, which are crucial for the development of quantum computers and sensors.Physicists consider the temperature range near absolute zero to be a particularly exciting area for research. Thermal fluctuations are reduced to a minimum. The laws of quantum physics come into play and reveal special properties of materials. Electric current then flows freely without any resistance. Another example is a phenomenon called superfluidity: Individual atoms fuse into a collective state and move past each other without friction.These extremely low temperatures are also required to research and harness quantum effects for quantum computing. Researchers worldwide as well as at Forschungszentrum J lich are currently pursuing this goal at full speed. Quantum computers could be far superior to conventional supercomputers for certain tasks. However, development is still in its infancy. A key challenge is finding materials and processes that make complex architectures with stable quantum bits possible. I believe a versatile microscope like ours is the tool of choice for this fascinating task, because it enables matter to be visualized and manipulated at the level of individual atoms and molecules in many different ways,  explains Ruslan Temirov from Forschungszentrum J lich.Over years of work, he and his team have equipped a scanning tunnelling microscope with magnetic cooling for this purpose.  Our new microscope differs from all the others in a similar way to how an electric car differs from a vehicle with a combustion engine,  explains the J lich physicist. Until now, researchers have relied on a kind of liquid fuel, a mixture of two helium isotopes, to bring microscopes to such low temperatures.  During operation, this cooling mixture circulates continuously through thin pipes, which leads to increased background noise,  says Temirov.The cooling device of J lich s microscope, on the other hand, is based on the process of adiabatic demagnetization. The principle is not new. It was used in the 1930s to reach temperatures below 1 kelvin in the laboratory for the first time. For the operation of microscopes, it has several advantages, says Ruslan Temirov:  With this method, we can cool our new microscope just by changing the strength of the electric current passing through an electromagnetic coil. Thus, our microscope has no moving parts and is practically vibration-free. The J lich scientists are the first ever to have constructed a scanning tunneling microscope using this technique.  The new cooling technology has several practical advantages. Not only does it improve the imaging quality, but the operation of the whole instrument and the entire setup are simplified,  says institute director Stefan Tautz. Thanks to its modular design, the J lich quantum microscope also remains open to technical advances, he adds, as upgrades can be easily implemented. Adiabatic cooling is a real quantum leap for scanning tunneling microscopy. The advantages are so significant that we are now developing a commercial prototype as our next step,  Stefan Tautz explains. Quantum technologies are currently the focus of much research. The interest of many research groups in such an instrument is therefore assured.Reference: Esat T, Borgens P, Yang X, et al.

In order to be used, this DNA is first transcribed into messenger RNA in the cell cytoplasm, then translated into protein with the help of ribosomes, small machines capable of decoding messenger RNA to synthesise the appropriate proteins. However, the speed with which this mechanism takes place is not uniform: it must adapt to allow the protein to adopt the right configuration. Indeed, a deregulation of the production rate leads to structural defects. The proteins, which are not correctly folded will aggregate, become unusable and often toxic for the cell. By analysing the rate of ribosome movement in yeast cells, a team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, in collaboration with the University of Hamburg, has succeeded in demonstrating that the rate of protein synthesis is modulated by regulatory factors that modify at will the rate of translation of messenger RNA into proteins. These results can be found in the journal Cell Reports.Proteins are 3D structures that, in order to act, must interlock with each other or interact with partners. In case of a structural defect, the proteins clump together, becoming toxic and potentially pathological. This phenomenon is actually observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  We already knew that the rate at which proteins are made varies according to need: sometimes fast, sometimes very slow , explains Martine Collart, a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, who led this research.  However, we did not yet know how this mechanism was controlled.  ","Published: September 1, 2021"

But there is growing recognition that they can be hazardous in the environment even at low levels of concentration. This is of concern because their concentrations are not monitored and there are no water quality standards set for them,  says study author Diane McKnight, who is an INSTAAR Fellow and engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.The study is the first to look at how rare earth elements move within a watershed that is rich in minerals. It is also the first to investigate how climate change, by altering stream flow and natural weathering processes, is releasing more rare earth elements into streams.Diane McKnight has led her students in investigations of water quality in the Snake River watershed of Colorado since the 1990s. Their main focus has been measuring and observing acid rock drainage. In this process, rocks that include sulfide-based minerals, such as pyrite, oxidize when exposed to air and water. The resulting chemical reaction produces sulfuric acid and dissolved metals like iron, which drain into streams. More acidic water can further dissolve heavy metals, like lead, cadmium, and zinc, and as it turns out can carry rare earth elements as well. What really controls the mobility of rare earth elements is pH. Acid literally leaches it out of the rocks,  says first author Garrett Rue, who earned a masters degree studying limnology with McKnight and a subsequent PhD from CU Boulder. Acid rock drainage happens naturally throughout the western United States, with its pyrite-rich geology. But historic mines that disturb large amounts of rocks and soil amp up the process dramatically and cause downstream water pollution.Within the Snake River watershed, towns impacted by acid mine drainage have been forced to adapt to poor water quality. Some former mining boomtowns, like Silverton, import water from distant sources. Others rely on expensive water treatment plants. All fish in the Snake River are stocked, since the water is too high in zinc for any native fish species to survive. The problem is endemic to the western United States, says Rue:  Upwards of forty percent of the headwaters to major rivers in the West are contaminated by some form of acid mine or rock drainage. The Snake River has made a good natural laboratory for investigating both, since the Peru Creek part of the watershed was heavily mined, while the Upper Snake River was not. But Rue and McKnight found that both parts of the watershed are now contributing significant amounts of metals downstream, as climate change has brought longer summers and less snow in the winters. Longer, lower stream flows make it easier for metals to leach into the watershed, and concentrate the metals that would otherwise be diluted by snowmelt.The same processes that mean more heavy metals are finding their way into streams are also acting on rare earth elements. The researchers found rare earth elements throughout the Snake River.  We documented a concentration range of one to hundreds of micrograms per liter several orders of magnitude higher than typical for surface waters with the highest concentrations nearest the headwaters and areas receiving drainage from abandoned mine workings,  says Rue.They also documented that increases in rare earth elements in the Snake River corresponded to warming summer air temperatures, and that rare earth elements are accumulating in insects living in streams at concentrations comparable to other metals such as lead and cadmium shown to be toxic. We re starting to understand that once rare earth elements get in the water, they tend to stay there,  says Rue.  They aren t removed by traditional treatment processes either, which has implications for reuse and has led some European cities to designate REEs as an emerging contaminant to drinking water supplies. And considering that the Snake River flows directly into Dillion Reservoir, which is Denver s largest source of stored water, this could be a concern for the future.""The researchers suggest that investigating and investing in technologies to recover rare earth elements from natural waters could yield valuable commodities and help address the problems associated with acid rock and mine drainage, which are poised to worsen as the climate shifts. Rare earth elements are used to make a lot of products. But most of the supply comes from China. So our government has been looking for sources, but at the same time mining has left an indelible mark on the waters of the West,  says Rue.  If we can harvest some of these materials that are already coming into our environment, it might be worthwhile to treat that water and recover these materials at the same time. This problem is getting worse and we need to deal with it,  adds McKnight.  If we can solve the problem holistically, we can have a valuable resource and also think about climate adaptation.

If so, you may suffer from misokinesia  or the  hatred of movements. According to new UBC research, approximately one-third of the population suffer from the psychological phenomenon, which is defined by a strong negative emotional response to the sight of someone else s small and repetitive movements.  This study is the first of its kind on misokinesia,  says lead author Sumeet Jaswal, a PhD student in UBC s department of psychology.  Surprisingly, scientific research on the topic has been lacking. For the study, the researchers conducted three separate experiments, which involved a total of 4,100 participants. They asked participants to self-report whether they have sensitivities to seeing people fidget as well as assessed the emotional and social impacts of the phenomenon. The researchers found that one-third of the participants felt sensitivities when they see others fidget.  These participants were negatively impacted emotionally and experience reactions such as anger, anxiety or frustration,  says the study s senior author Dr. Todd Handy, a UBC psychology professor.  They were also negatively impacted socially and report difficulty and reduced enjoyment in social situations, work and learning environments. Some even pursue fewer social activities because of the condition.  Dr. Handy adds, these impacts appear to increase with age as the older adults reported a broader range of challenges.The researchers are hoping to find out whether mirror neurons may be at play for individuals who suffer from misokinesia. Mirror neurons activate when an individual moves but they also activate when the individual sees others move. That s where the term  mirror  comes from since we  mirror  the movements of others in our brain. These neurons help us understand other people and the intention behind their movements,  says Jaswal.  They are linked to empathy. For example, when you see someone get hurt, you may wince as well, as their pain is mirrored in your own brain and that causes you to experience their emotions and empathize with them. She adds:  A reason that people fidget is because they re anxious or nervous so when individuals who suffer from misokinesia see that, they may mirror it and feel anxious or nervous as well. The researchers are hoping to examine this more closely in their future research as well as whether find out if there s a genetic component to the sensitivity.   To those who are suffering from misokinesia,  You are not alone. Your challenge is common and it's real. As a society, we need to recognize that a lot of you suffer silently from this visual challenge that it can adversely impact your ability to work, learn in school and enjoy social situations ,  says Dr. Handy.  It s a widely shared challenge that no one has ever really talked about. By starting this discussion, there is reason for hope in better understanding and outcomes.

As a result, blood vessels can become leaky and major organs can t get the oxygen and nutrients they require to sustain life. Sepsis is a major reason that patients, including many with COVID-19, end up in the intensive care unit. The condition is notoriously difficult to treat, and there are no drugs that help stabilize the cell barrier that lines blood vessels.University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers are working to better understand how the body controls blood vessel permeability, and how they might intervene to restore blood vessel integrity during sepsis, trauma or other conditions.  The team recently discovered that a protein called HSP27 plays a role in regulating blood vessel leakage. To help breakdown or buildup blood vessel barrier, cells add and remove chemical tags on HSP27.The study, publishing August 31, 2021 in Science Signaling, provides new potential targets for the development of drugs that shore up blood vessel barriers, preventing fluid loss. This new information will help us home in on the root cause of leaky blood vessels, rather than taking a broad strokes approach that may have many off-target effects,  said senior author JoAnn Trejo, PhD, professor of pharmacology and assistant vice chancellor of the Office of Health Sciences Faculty Affairs at UC San Diego School of Medicine.Blood vessel barriers need to be dynamic   permeable enough to allow immune cells to squeeze out to reach the site of an infection, for example, but not so leaky that the situation becomes life-threatening. According to Trejo, HSP27 binds to proteins that help form the cell s  skeleton.  She and colleagues suspect that s why HSP27 can affect blood vessel permeability   by fortifying the skeleton of cells that maintain the barrier.Trejo has long studied G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), proteins that are embedded in cell membranes throughout the body, where they act as signal transducers, allowing cells to respond to their external environments. GPCRs play a crucial role in most biological functions. Approximately one-third of all therapeutic drugs on the market work because they influence GPCR signals.In their latest study, the team found that during inflammation, GPCRs tell enzymes called kinases to add chemical (phosphate) tags to HSP27. The tags perturb HSP27 s structure in a way that disrupts blood vessel barriers. When HSP27 reassembles, the barriers recover. The researchers validated their lab studies in mice, where they found that inhibiting HSP27 increases blood vessel leakage. One challenge in targeting GPCRs to treat a disease is the fact that most act as master regulators, influencing several different cell functions. Inhibiting one GPCR may have many unintended consequences. By focusing further downstream   aiming not at the master GPCR but at individual targets upon which it acts, such as HSP27   Trejo s team is hoping to enable the development of blood vessel barrier-stabilizing drugs that are more precise and have fewer negative side effects.  It s become apparent that you can develop different molecules that can bind to receptor and  bias  them   make them signal in a very specific way to some pathways but not others,  Trejo said.  It s what we call biased agonism, and it s a huge advantage for drug development. It means we can develop not just an on/off switch, but a drug that can switch a receptor  off  or eight different types of  on.  We want to be able to tweak which pathways are on and not touch others. The team plans to explore additional cell signaling pathways that helps blood vessels build resistance to injury and inflammation.Reference: Rada CC, Mejia-Pena H, Grimsey NJ, et al.

This has affected the prices and practices of legitimate farmers, reducing sustainability gains.   In the findings, published in the journal Supply Chain Management, the multi-university research team reveal that biomarkers can create  meta-barcodes , which are like biochemical fingerprints, an unchanging barcode extracted from the plant s DNA, providing a unique identifier of a plant that is also observed in its beans and subsequent chocolate products. The biomarker of cocoa beans used in chocolate manufacturing could accurately identify the farm, production facility or cooperative where a cocoa product came from.  To make this new process a reality, a controlled data set of biomarkers of registered locations is required for audit. The study goes on to explain that this missing piece -- a biomarker database that identifies the origin of cocoa products, can be built by companies at an estimated cost of  5 per sample   around the cost of a box of chocolates.  Glenn Parry, Professor of Digital Transformation at University of Surrey, said:  The chocolate market has become turbulent, and we have evidence of over 100 years of slavery in the supply chain. Governments and chocolate producers are faced with an ethical challenge and drastically need to improve a trade that is rife with environmental destruction and human misery.   We have an effective approach for them to make progress. We demonstrate that biomarkers can provide supply chain visibility from the individual farm to the retail chocolate bar. This solution could now be within reach, where the journey of the chocolate in your fridge could be traced back to the cocoa trees where it began.

This tool collects and monitors body fluids while sticking to the skin s surface, paving the way for more accurate diagnostics and treatment for skin diseases and conditions like acne. The team includes Bo-yong Park, a former postdoctoral researcher at The Neuro at McGill University. What problem did you set out to solve?Traditional non-invasive diagnostic devices developed for skin care have several limitations. These devices tend to be less accurate, hard to use, and require expensive equipment to analyze results. The chemical adhesives used in the process can also cause skin irritation or sometimes damage, making them difficult to use repeatedly or for a long time. Maintaining adhesion in different conditions like a wet or a curved skin surface can also be very challenging.Why did you look to nature for inspiration?Male diving beetles or Hydaticus pacificus are aquatic insects that have evolved special adhesive hairs, or setae, to latch onto their mates underwater. The setae, which are present on the male s forelegs, have unique suction cup-like structures and cavities, providing strong attachment against wet and irregular surfaces. Inspired by male diving beetles, we developed an intelligent device for real-time monitoring of skin health that attaches to the skin s irregular surface.How does the device work?We created micro-sized artificial suction cups that can collect and monitor body fluids while adhering to the skin. We embedded fluid-capturing hydrogels within the cavities of the cups to monitor pH levels. The hydrogel changes colour with differing acidity levels. Integrating machine learning techniques, we also develop a software application that can automatically quantify pH levels from the colour indicated by the pH-responsive hydrogels. We expect that this device will be applied to personalized skin treatment patches, medical adhesive materials, and diagnostic technologies. Based on the results of our research, we expect it could be used for on-site diagnosis of biomarkers for skin disease.About this study""Diving beetle like miniaturized plungers with reversible, rapid biofluid capturing for machine learning based care of skin disease"" by Sangyul Baik, Jihyun Lee, Eun Je Jeon, Bo-yong Park, Da Wan Kim, Jin Ho Song, Heon Joon Lee, Seung Yeop Han, Seung-Woo Cho, and Changhyun Pang was published in Science Advances.

In addition to determining the course of the disease, these differences between individual cancer cells control the effectiveness of targeted therapies. A team of researchers from Charit    Universit tsmedizin Berlin and the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) has been able to trace the developmental trajectories of colorectal cancer cells. In addition to observing how individual cells respond to cancer therapies, the researchers were also able to see the way in which cancer cells sometimes develop resistance following treatment. Writing in EMBO Molecular Medicine, the researchers suggest that this knowledge can be used to identify where current treatment approaches fall short and how these shortcomings might be improved.A technique known as single cell sequencing enables researchers to study gene expression   the activity of individual genes   across thousands of cells at the same time. Tumors consists of subpopulations of cells which, in addition to having different characteristics, continually adapt to changes in their microenvironment. Using single cell sequencing, a team of researchers led by PD Dr. Markus Morkel and Prof. Dr. Nils Bl thgen from Charit s Institute of Pathology studied the inherent heterogeneity of tumor tissues in order to gain a clearer picture of the colorectal cancer development process.The researchers started by comparing colorectal cancer cells with cells found in healthy gut tissue. By collecting data on a total of more than 100,000 individual cells, they were able to define cell characteristics which were universal across individual patients. Conventional sequencing methods only provide a picture of gene activity at a specific moment in time. In order to recreate and observe the dynamic changes taking place in tissues at the cellular level, the researchers had to create three-dimensional cultures of colorectal cancer cells.  Using these  organoids  as they are called, we were able to trace the cells  developmental trajectory,  explains PD Dr. Morkel, adding:  Thanks to a clever laboratory technique, we were able to label the cells  RNA at a specific point in time. In addition to determining the current status of activity for each individual cell, this technique also provided us with a picture of gene expression from a few hours earlier.  The research team then examined the way in which the cancer cells within these organoids adapted to clinically important therapies with targeted inhibitors. Not all of the cancer cells responded in the same way. While some cells were extinguished by this treatment, others took what might be best described as  a wrong turn . Deviating from their normal developmental trajectories, they entered a new state which rendered them resistant to the recently administered treatments. These types of single cell experiments with cancer tissues represent a huge logistical and technical challenge. They involve collaborations between specialists across multiple facilities   ranging from surgical specialists to database experts,  explains PD Dr. Morkel, who also serves as the main point of contact at the BIH at Charit s Bioportal Single Cells, a core facility which aims to enable the fast and efficient incorporation of single cell technologies in near-patient translational research. One obvious challenge is addressed by Prof. Bl thgen, who is also a researcher at the Integrative Research Institute (IRI) for the Life Sciences at the Humboldt-Universit t zu Berlin (HU):  Measuring the activity of thousands of genes in hundreds of thousands of cells produces very large volumes of data,  he explains, adding:  It is mainly due to advances in the field of machine learning that we are now in a position to analyze these data in an efficient way. This enables us to gain a better understanding of the essential cellular processes and then use this for the benefit of patients.  Single cell experiments, machine learning and patient-specific cell culture models are set to play a key role in the research and development of new cancer treatment options at Charit .Reference: Uhlitz F, Bischoff P, Peidli S et al.

A new measurement technique developed by the research team detected PFAS chemicals in the air of kindergarten classrooms, university offices and laboratories, and a home some with levels as high as those measured at an outdoor clothing company and carpet stores selling PFAS-treated products. The results suggest indoor air is an underestimated and potentially important source of exposure to PFAS, particularly for children. Food and water are known to be major sources of PFAS exposure,  said Rainer Lohmann, senior author of the study and professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island.  Our study shows that indoor air, including dust, is another source of exposure to potentially harmful forever chemicals. In fact, for children in homes or schools with old PFAS-treated carpets, inhalation may be even more important than dust as an exposure pathway to volatile PFAS that eventually could biotransform to more persistent and harmful PFAS.  Well-studied PFAS have been associated with a wide range of serious health harms, from cancer to infertility to immune system problems. All PFAS are either extremely persistent in the environment or break down into extremely persistent PFAS. By affixing polyethylene sheet samplers to ceilings, the scientists measured volatile PFAS chemicals in the air of nine carpeted kindergarten classrooms, one home, and the storage room of an outdoor clothing store in California; as well as two laboratories, five offices, one classroom, one storage room, and one elevator at the University of Rhode Island; and two carpet stores, also in Rhode Island. PFAS were detected in the air of nearly every location. Several kindergarten classrooms and rooms at the university had higher indoor air concentrations of PFAS than the storage room of the outdoor clothing store, which was full of jackets and gear treated with PFAS. The highest concentrations were found in the two carpet stores.  PFAS were formerly used as stain and water repellents in most carpets,   according to the paper s lead author Maya Morales-McDevitt.  Fortunately, major retailers including The Home Depot and Lowe s now only sell PFAS-free carpets. We believe that slowly smaller retailers will do so as well.  While families, schools, and workplaces can reduce indoor air levels of PFAS by replacing carpets, there are still many other products that can emit volatile PFAS into indoor air, including clothing, shoes, building products, and furnishings.  As long as they continue to be used in products, we ll all be eating, drinking, and breathing PFAS,  said Tom Bruton, a co-author and senior scientist at the Green Science Policy Institute.  We need to turn off the tap and stop all unnecessary uses of PFAS as soon as possible. ReferenceMorales-McDevitt ME, Becanova J, Blum A, et al.

Statistics on the global burden of high blood pressure this week show that there s been a doubling in the past 30 years of hypertension cases   the leading cause of the world s top killer: heart attack and stroke,  Professor Chow said.Dr Emily Atkins from The George Institute for Global Health, UNSW Sydney and the University of Sydney said:  In settings with high levels of specialist care and full access to a range of existing blood pressure medicines   like the centres in this trial   the improved reduction in blood pressure with this strategy would be expected to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by about 20 percent. In settings with little or no existing hypertension treatment, the benefits would be much greater.  The multi-centre, Australian clinical trial of a potential future  quadpill  dose of four medications, termed Quadruple UltrA-low-dose tReatment for hypErTension (QUARTET), has demonstrated that a single pill containing ultra-low quadruple combination is much more effective than the traditional approach of starting with monotherapy (single drug).The study funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council enrolled 591 participants with high blood pressure either in no treatment or  single therapy across 10 centres in Australia. The primary outcome was the significantly reduced blood pressure in the group starting on the quadpill,  at 12 weeks. These differences were sustained, with blood pressure control still better with the quadpill approach compared to the standard approach at 12 months, and no differences in side effects.Senior author Professor Anthony Rodgers of The George Institute, UNSW Sydney and Imperial College London, said:  Our trial has overwhelmingly demonstrated the efficacy, tolerability and safety of this ultra-low-dose combination strategy   a potentially simple and scalable hypertension management strategy to treat hypertension. Professor Chow said the study built on their previous study comparing a quadpill approach to placebo.  We aimed to test this new quadpill strategy against usual care in Australia; as is often seen in clinical trials, people in the comparison group got much better treatment than average. Nonetheless our new quadpill strategy was much better,  she said. This was the first study to show the benefits are maintained long-term without any reduction over time. Even though much more add-on blood pressure medicines were used in the comparison group throughout follow-up, they never caught up with the quadpill group. Professor Chow said there were still important research questions.  For people who may be having side effects from their current treatments, we would like to know whether a switch to an utra-low-dose combination can improve things. Also, the WHO Hypertension Guidelines released this week, just like other recent hypertension guidelines in Europe, US and elsewhere, recommend most patients start on two blood pressure drugs rather than one. We need to know how that would compare to a quadpill strategy. There is also a major research translation challenge ahead:  These kinds of strategies will only make a major impact on global health if they are available and affordable for patients most in need,  said Professor Chow. When we find treatments that are this effective, simple and safe we must do our best to get them to those who can benefit most. Professor Chow said a simple and effective combination quadpill strategy had potential to impact people s lives worldwide.  High blood pressure is the leading cause of preventable deaths globally   we hope our world-leading findings will be translated swiftly into a product available for the general public,  she concluded.Reference: Chow CK, Atkins ER, Hillis GS, et al.

These rain-borne microbes have the opportunity to become part of a plant s aboveground microbial community   known as the phyllosphere. Phyllosphere microbes can protect plants from disease and other stressors and understanding where they come from may help us improve plant health.  While plant microbiome research has historically focused on soil and seeds as sources of plant-associated microbes, new findings by scientists at Virginia Tech University suggest that rain may also be an important reservoir. A study recently published in Phytobiomes Journal led by Marco Mechan-Llontop and Boris Vinatzer examined rain as a reservoir of phyllosphere bacteria. After finding greater densities of microbes on the leaves of rain-exposed tomato plants compared to those grown in the lab, they set out to experimentally test whether rain-borne microbes could successfully colonize the phyllosphere of tomato plants.   Although this is a simple question, it is actually really hard to answer since plants outside are exposed to many bacteria that come from the soil, rain, and the air,  noted Vinatzer.  Additionally, while rain may contain important microbes, their quantities may be small a milliliter of rain might only contain a few microbial cells.  To control for other external sources of microbes and inoculate plants with measurable doses of rain-borne microbes, Vinatzer and colleagues performed a laboratory experiment with rain they collected. They filtered the rainwater to obtain sterilized water and membranes containing the bacterial microbiota. These membranes were incubated to obtain a highly concentrated inoculum of rain-borne bacteria. They sprayed plants with this inoculum or with sterilized rainwater and distilled water (as negative controls) and incubated the plants for one week before characterizing their bacterial communities via DNA analyses. Their analysis showed that inoculating plants with the rainwater microbial communities increased the abundance of over 100 bacterial taxa, indicating that microbes in rain can successfully colonize and grow on the surface of plants. This suggests rain is a potentially important reservoir for phyllosphere bacteria. The authors hope this research will pave the way for more research into the origins of plant-associated microorganisms and microbes that are efficiently distributed by rain.  The more we know about these bacteria, the better we can use them to our advantage to improve plant health,  says Vinatzer. For example, bacteria that suppress plant pathogens could be sprayed onto leaves to reduce or prevent disease.  The authors plan to continue their research examining the importance of rain in phyllosphere assembly and hope to identify beneficial bacteria from rain.ReferenceMechan Llontop ME, Tian L, Sharma P, et al.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is funding this $450,000 project, which will involve 300 family physicians and nurse practitioners.The goal of the pan-Canadian randomized controlled trial is to identify segments of the patient population with common reasons for vaccine hesitancy or lack of access, by age, language, education level, rurality, gender, and ethnicity. Primary care providers can then provide these groups with appropriately tailored digital information by e-mail and text message.  We want to help family physicians or primary care practitioners to learn about patients  perspectives and survey if they are vaccinated or not. And, if not, why?  says Dr. Sharon Johnston, Associate Professor in the Faculty of Medicine and an Investigator at the Institut du Savoir Montfort and Bruy re Research Institute. By understanding the concerns and barriers faced by this subgroup, we can amass data that can guide us on communicating more effectively. We will be able to identify groups of patients who share similar reasons for being unvaccinated and common features, and we can create short messages to share reliable and relevant resources on COVID-19 vaccines to help them with their decision-making,  adds Dr. Johnston.Family practitioners will use the Canadian Primary Care Information Network (CPIN), an automated patient engagement system for primary care practices, to rapidly inform patients about new procedures for clinic visits, availability of vaccines from COVID-19 to flu, or patient education materials for managing conditions like back pain. CPIN also offers a reliable and confidential system to collect anonymous feedback on patients  experiences by including a link to a short survey at the end of each message. This tool will help primary care communicate better with patients in an effective way, reaching their patients more easily,  Johnston says.  By learning what patients prefer   such as a virtual visit or an in-person one, or what factors led to their hesitancy to be vaccinated   we can try to develop a tool that will lessen the workload, share good information and help our patients to make well informed decisions when it comes to their health. Primary care practitioners often see patients from within a 100-kilometre radius, making this innovative research project a means of delivering information to patients from a physician who may not be familiar with their home area and the services available to them.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The study also tests how well current vaccines resist emerging variants.The Northwestern University study underscores the importance of receiving a second dose of vaccine, not only because it is commonly known that immunity from vaccines wanes over time, but also because of the risk posed by emerging variants, including the highly contagious delta variant.The study also showed that prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 does not guarantee a high level of antibodies, nor does it guarantee a robust antibody response to the first vaccine dose. This directly contradicts the assumption that contracting COVID will naturally make someone immune to re-infection. The findings further support vaccination (and two doses), even for people who have contracted the virus previously.A team of scientists, including biological anthropologist Thomas McDade and pharmacologist Alexis Demonbreun, tested blood samples from adults who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to measure how long the immunity benefits of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines last and how well they protect from newer variants.Study participants were selected from a racially and ethnically diverse community-based sample of Chicago-area adults recruited at the start of the pandemic.

In fact, estimates indicate that in the United States, only 4% to 18% of opioid overdoses that are treated in a hospital or pre-hospital setting such as an ambulance or someone s home actually kill the patient. But there s a lot that scientists still don t know about what nonfatal overdoses do to the brain.To better understand the topic, Erin Winstanley and James Mahoney researchers with the West Virginia University School of Medicine and Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute reviewed 79 studies of neurocognitive impairments and brain abnormalities associated with nonfatal opioid overdoses in humans. The studies all had limitations, a sign that more precise research is needed in this area. Yet despite the studies  shortcomings, their findings still suggested that brain abnormalities and cognitive impairments are linked to overdose. I think there s probably a host of morbidities associated with experiencing a nonfatal opioid-related overdose that s largely neglected in the published literature and to a certain extent from a public health standpoint,  said Winstanley, an associate professor in the Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry and the Department of Neuroscience.  We should first focus on saving lives. That s definitely the appropriate step. But we probably should start paying attention to some of these other issues, too. Given the proportion of people who have experienced a nonfatal overdose, the number of deaths is just the tip of the iceberg. Their findings appear in Drug and Alcohol Dependence.Winstanley, Mahoney and their colleagues Felipe Castillo and Sandra Comer of Columbia University performed a systematic review of journal articles published between 1973 and 2020.Overall, the studies lacked the level of detail and consistency that would have made many direct comparisons and inferences possible.For instance, fewer than half of the studies reported toxicology results confirming an opioid overdose. Only 27.8% reported results of neuropsychological testing, and only 64.6% reported magnetic resonance imaging or MRI results of the brain.The team discovered that all of the studies were at risk of one form of bias or another. Some studies, for example, failed to measure participants  intellectual functioning, consider whether they had received prompt overdose treatment or reported whether they were using anything besides opioids. Independent of overdose, addiction research is complicated in general because of all these numerous confounding variables,  said Mahoney, an associate professor and clinical neuropsychologist in the WVU Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry and the Department of Neuroscience.  There are often medical and psychiatric comorbidities and several other factors that may be impacting the cognition of these individuals. On top of that, co-occurring substance use in addition to opioids is more the norm than the exception. The overdose itself complicates matters further. How long was the individual s brain deprived of oxygen? Did they receive adequate treatment in time? How long post-overdose was neuroimaging or cognitive testing done? All of these variables and many others can influence a study s results. Also, there are so many different measurements that are used to test cognitive functioning, making it even more difficult to compare findings across the literature,  Mahoney said.Despite these inconsistencies, the studies provided evidence that an opioid overdose has the potential to change how someone s brain appears or behaves. In turn, those changes could influence someone s attention span, memory, executive function or other higher-order thinking skills. This news is quite positive in the sense that if we can start to do early identification and screening for neurocognitive deficits whether they re associated with overdose or not we might actually have the right kind of rehabilitation therapy for them, including some promising new treatments for cognitive deficits,  Winstanley said.That s important because neurocognitive deficits make poor treatment outcomes more likely for people who want to stop using opioids or other substances. If we are able to target those at a higher risk of cognitive impairment perhaps those who have had five or six overdoses and individualize their treatment plans to address those deficits as early in the treatment process as possible, we may be able to improve their outcomes, given what is known about cognition and treatment dropout,  Mahoney said.To gain more insight into those deficits and how they can be addressed, Winstanley, Mahoney and their colleagues at WVU and Columbia University have begun a new project. They re comparing the cognition of two groups of people with opioid use disorder: those with a past history of overdose and those without any overdose history.The researchers have had all participants complete the same comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests. As they gather and analyze the data, the researchers will take into account characteristics such as the participants  age, education level and intellectual functioning; how long they have been using substances; and which substances they have used.In addition, the team has used functional MRI to form images of some of the participants  brains to provide insight into how the brain is actually working as they completed working-memory tasks. While the neurocognitive testing lets us know how these individuals are actually performing on various thinking tasks, the fMRI data will also give us a sense neuroanatomically of how the brain is functioning, how the various brain networks are engaged and how different areas of the brain are interacting with one another,  Mahoney said.  We will have the opportunity to gain better insight into what factors other than their opioid use and overdose such as the co-occurring use of other substances may be impacting these brain networks. Insights into how opioid use, overdose and other variables affect the brain could lead to novel neuromodulation treatments, including ones that Mahoney is now exploring.Neuromodulation involves altering the activity of specific brain areas and networks through the application of electrical pulses, a magnetic field, of other forms of stimulation.In 2019, Mahoney was part of a team of scientists from RNI and WVU Medicine that launched the world s first Food and Drug Administration approved clinical trial of deep brain stimulation to treat opioid use disorder. He s also investigating the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation another form of neuromodulation to fight addiction, as well as low-intensity focused ultrasound, which has been studied for several disorders but is in the infancy of exploration as a potential treatment for substance use disorder.  By helping to rewire those areas of the brain that are involved in craving and cognition, such as disinhibition, decision making, attention and higher-order executive functions, we can hopefully improve cognitive functioning, which would subsequently improve treatment outcomes,  he said.  It s unrealistic to think that neuromodulation will simply  fix  addiction, but when used in combination with the standard of care comprehensive behavioral treatment with medication for opioid use disorder we will hopefully be able to provide another strategy to help people achieve abstinence.

The discovery provides a powerful new tool to locate and manage genetically modified animals that have escaped or been released into the wild.The magic of eDNAIn a study published in PLOS ONE, the researchers show for the first time that artificial transgenes from a variety of genetically modified animals like fruit flies, mice, and tetra fish can be detected and sequenced from the DNA left behind in soil, water, and in the form of feces, urine, or saliva. These findings could be used, for example, to detect the transgenes of genetically modified mosquitoes from pools of standing water in areas where they were recently released.Compared to traditional animal monitoring methods, environmental DNA (eDNA) has proven to be more accurate and efficient, requiring less time and lower costs. Until now no one had applied these environmental DNA methods to genetically modified animals, even though they are already in the wild,  says Charles Xu, a PhD student in Department of Biology at McGill University.  Detection of animal transgenes from eDNA can be very useful because it can tell you whether genetically modified animals are there without the need to find them. An explosion of genetically modified animalsAdvances in genome-editing technologies like CRISPR have dramatically simplified the process of creating genetically modified organisms, leading to an explosion in the number and types of genetically modified animals being produced around the world. With them come concerns about the ecological, evolutionary, and bioethical implications of these new creatures. Some genetically modified animals, like glowing aquarium fish, can be purchased by the public, while others, like mosquitos, have been released into the wild. The creatures carry artificial transgenes, or genes that have either been altered by scientists or introduced from another species by artificial means. Because genetically modified animals are often indistinguishable from their natural counterparts based on appearance alone, environmental DNA or eDNA methods could be especially useful for early detection and monitoring purposes,  he adds.  That is especially true in cases where these animals may escape from the lab or the farm, move to places they do not belong, or crossbreed with natural animals. In the future, labs, companies, and governments involved in producing and managing genetically modified animals will be able to use eDNA methods to detect and track them in real-life contexts.Reference: Xu CCY, Ramsay C, Cowan M, Dehghani M, Lasko P, Barrett RDH.

Xia is now a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University. We know that the brain is a flexible structure because we expect the neural activity in the brain to change over days when we learn, or when we gain experience   even as adults,  Xia said.  What is somewhat unexpected is that even when there is no learning, or no experience changes, neural activity still changes across days in different brain areas. Researchers in Wessel s group explore sensory information processing in the brain. Working with collaborators, they use novel data analysis to address questions of dynamics and computation in neural circuits of the visual cortex of the brain.Study co-senior author Michael J. Goard, from the Neuroscience Research Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara, showed mice a single, short movie clip on a loop. (They used a section of the opening from a classic Orson Welles black-and-white film, de rigueur for today s mouse vision studies.) While a mouse watched the movie, researchers simultaneously recorded activity in several hundred neurons in the primary visual cortex, using two-photon calcium imaging.The scientists repeated the viewing sessions weekly for up to seven weeks, recording the activity of the same neurons in the same mice as they watched the loop of the same 30-second movie clip.Then the physicists at Washington University parsed the data from the movie-watching mice, using new computational approaches to analyze the changes in neuronal population activity over time.The researchers discovered that single-neuron responses to natural movies are unstable across weeks. In other words, individual neurons did not respond the same way to the visual stimuli   what was happening on the screen at the exact same moment in the film   when the mouse watched the film one week as compared with another week. This research finding was consistent with a study published by their collaborators in the same journal issue, Xia said.However, in this particular study, the Washington University physicists were able to develop a way to decode the response to the visual stimuli across weeks if they factored in the population activity all of the neurons tracked for a given mouse   they just couldn t do it using individual neurons alone.Although Xia mapped out a consistent representation of the movie clip using the population activity, the scientists still don t know whether this representation from the primary visual cortex is what the downstream brain areas are actually reading out.Over the past 10 years, neuroscientists have increasingly documented similar examples of this  representational drift  in neural activity within different areas of the brain   with the first studies reporting drift in the activity of neurons in the hippocampus and the posterior parietal cortex.But even with those studies already in print, many scientists are not prepared to deal with the possibility of drift in other areas of the brain, Xia said. People still don t expect this kind of drift to be coming from the primary visual cortex,  she said.  The general belief is that those primary sensory cortices should be very reliable, because they are expected to faithfully encode the information from the sensory stimuli.

Researchers from Japan and China have discovered how a multi-tasking protein helps flowers to develop as expected.In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A., researchers from Nanjing University and Nara Institute of Science and Technology have revealed that a small protein plays multiple roles to ensure that floral reproductive organs are formed properly within a short space of time.Flowers develop from floral meristems, which differentiate to produce the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. The proper development of these floral organs depends on meristem development being completed within a certain time period. In the early stages of flower development, stem cells provide the cell source for floral organ formation. In floral meristems, stem cell activities are maintained via a feedback loop between WUSCHEL (WUS), a gene that identifies floral stem cells, and CLAVATA3 (CLV3), a stem cell marker gene that is activated and sustained by WUS.""A small protein called KNUCKLES (KNU) represses WUS directly, which leads to the completion of floral stem cell activity at the right time,"" says lead author Erlei Shang of the study. ""What isn't fully understood is how the robust floral stem cell activity finishes within a limited time period to ensure carpel development.""""The team's research revealed that in Arabidopsis thaliana, KNU can completely deactivate the robust floral meristems at a particular floral stage, thanks to the multiple functions that KNU carries out via its position-specific roles,"" says senior author Toshiro Ito.KNU both represses and silences WUS, and directly represses CLV3 and CLV1 (a gene that encodes a receptor for the CLV3 peptide). Consequently, KNU eliminates the CLV3-WUS feedback loop via transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms (i.e., those that do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequences). Additionally, KNU interacts physically with the WUS protein, which inhibits WUS from sustaining CLV3, disrupting interactions that are required for the maintenance of floral meristems.""Our results reveal a regulatory pathway where KNU plays a key role in supporting the completion of floral meristem development within a short time window, and ensures that flower reproductive organs are properly formed,"" says corresponding author Bo Sun.The results of this research will be useful for genetic studies of food crop species such as rice, tomatoes, and maize. An understanding of the floral meristem termination mechanism discovered in this study will benefit crop yields for food production globally.Reference: Shang E, Wang X, Li T, Guo F, Ito T, Sun B.

The shape has been highly regarded for its evolution as large enough to incubate an embryo, small enough to exit the body in the most efficient way, not roll away once laid, is structurally sound enough to bear weight and be the beginning of life for 10,500 species that have survived since the dinosaurs. The egg has been called the  perfect shape .Analysis of all egg shapes used four geometric figures: sphere, ellipsoid, ovoid, and pyriform (conical), with a mathematical formula for the pyriform yet to be derived.To rectify this, researchers introduced an additional function into the ovoid formula, developing a mathematical model to fit a completely novel geometric shape characterized as the last stage in the evolution of the sphere-ellipsoid, which it is applicable to any egg geometry.This new universal mathematical formula for egg shape is based on four parameters: egg length, maximum breadth, shift of the vertical axis, and the diameter at one quarter of the egg length.This long sought-for universal formula is a significant step in understanding not only the egg shape itself, but also how and why it evolved, thus making widespread biological and technological applications possible.Mathematical descriptions of all basic egg shapes have already found applications in food research, mechanical engineering, agriculture, biosciences, architecture and aeronautics. As an example, this formula can be applied to engineering construction of thin walled vessels of an egg shape, which should be stronger than typical spherical ones.This new formula is an important breakthrough with multiple applications including: Darren Griffin, Professor of Genetics in the University of Kent and PI on the research, said:  Biological evolutionary processes such as egg formation must be investigated for mathematical description as a basis for research in evolutionary biology, as demonstrated with this formula. This universal formula can be applied across fundamental disciplines, especially the food and poultry industry, and will serve as an impetus for further investigations inspired by the egg as a research object. Dr Michael Romanov, Visiting Researcher at the University of Kent, said:  This mathematical equation underlines our understanding and appreciation of a certain philosophical harmony between mathematics and biology, and from those two a way towards further comprehension of our universe, understood neatly in the shape of an egg. Dr Valeriy Narushin, former visiting researcher at the University of Kent, said:  We look forward to seeing the application of this formula across industries, from art to technology, architecture to agriculture. This breakthrough reveals why such collaborative research from separate disciplines is essential. Reference:Narushin VG, Romanov MN, Griffin DK.

The findings, published today in Science Advances, will help researchers develop new treatment strategies to limit the progression of solid cancer tumours, which represent the majority of tumour types that arise in the body.Solid tumours rely on blood supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients to help them grow. As the tumours advance, these blood vessels are unable to provide oxygen and nutrients to every part of the tumour, which results in areas of low oxygen. Over time, this low-oxygen environment leads to a buildup of acid inside the tumour cells.To overcome this stress, the cells adapt by unleashing enzymes that neutralize the acidic conditions of their environment, allowing the cells to not only survive, but ultimately become a more aggressive form of tumour capable of spreading to other organs. One of these enzymes is called Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX). Cancer cells depend on the CAIX enzyme to survive, which ultimately makes it their  Achilles heel.  By inhibiting its activity, we can effectively stop the cells from growing,  explains the study s senior author Dr. Shoukat Dedhar, professor in UBC faculty of medicine s department of biochemistry and molecular biology and distinguished scientist at BC Cancer.Dr. Dedhar and colleagues previously identified a unique compound, known as SLC-0111 currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials as a powerful inhibitor of the CAIX enzyme. While pre-clinical models of breast, pancreatic and brain cancers have demonstrated the effectiveness of this compound in suppressing tumour growth and spread, other cellular properties diminish its effectiveness.In this study, the research team, which included Dr. Shawn Chafe, a research associate in Dr. Dedhar s lab, together with Dr. Franco Vizeacoumar and colleagues from the University of Saskatchewan, set out to examine these cellular properties and identify other weaknesses of the CAIX enzyme using a powerful tool known as a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen. This tool looks at the genetics of a cancer cell and systematically deletes one gene at a time to determine if a cancer cell can be killed by eliminating the CAIX enzyme together with another specific gene. According to Dr. Dedhar, the results of their examination were surprising and point to an unexpected role of proteins and processes that control a form of cell death called ferroptosis. This form of cell death happens when iron builds up and weakens the tumour s metabolism and cell membranes.   We now know that the CAIX enzyme blocks cancer cells from dying as a result of ferroptosis,  says Dr. Dedhar.  Combining inhibitors of CAIX, including SLC-0111, with compounds known to bring about ferroptosis results in catastrophic cell death and debilitates tumor growth. There is currently a large international effort underway to identify drugs that can induce ferroptosis. This study is a major step forward in this quest.Reference: Chafe SC, Vizeacoumar FS, Venkateswaran G, et al.

The beneficial effect is related to a slowed rate of cognitive decline rather than a boost in cognitive function. That is what a recent study by MPIDR researcher Angelo Lorenti and colleagues found by analyzing data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study.Participating in the labor market until the age of 67 slows cognitive decline and is protective against cognitive impairment, such as that caused by Alzheimer s. This protective effect appears to hold regardless of gender and educational or occupational attainment. These findings were recently published in the journal SSM Population Health.The team of researchers with Jo Mhairi Hale, Maarten J. Bijlsma, and Angelo Lorenti, all affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, used data from the Health and Retirement Study on more than 20,000 US-Americans ages 55 to 75 who participated in the labor market at some point between 1996 and 2014.There are modifiable life-course predictors of cognitive functionWith population aging there is a growing concern about increasing prevalence in Alzheimer s disease. As there is no cure for Alzheimer s, it is important to understand the influences on cognitive function over one s life span, paying particular attention to modifiable risk factors. In this study, we approach retirement and cognitive function from the perspective that they both come near the end of a long path of life , says Angelo Lorenti. It begins with one's social origins in ethnicity, gender, and early-life social and economic status, goes on with educational and occupational attainment and health behaviors, and goes all the way up to more proximate factors such as partnership status and mental and physical health. All these kinds of factors accumulate and interact over a lifetime to affect both cognitive function and age at retirement.What are the health consequences of postponing retirement? We investigated how demographic change interacts with social and labor market dynamics , says Angelo Lorenti. In many countries governments have enacted policies to increase the statutory retirement age. That is why it is relevant to understand if retiring at older ages may have health consequences, particularly on cognitive function.  Our study suggests that there may be a fortuitous unintended consequence of postponed retirement , says Angelo Lorenti.Reference:Hale JM, Bijlsma MJ, Lorenti A.

Recently, researchers from Japan successfully isolated several strains of endophytic bacteria that survive in high concentrations of antimicrobial resveratrol and piceatannol inside passion fruit seeds and get transmitted to next-generation seedlings. One of the bacteria could convert resveratrol and piceatannol to their respective derivatives. These findings will significantly advance endophyte and biocatalyst research.Similar to the well-known human gut-resident microbes, the inside of a plant can also shelter microorganisms. Residing inside roots, stems, leaves, fruits, and even seeds, and developing a synergistic relationship with their host, these 'endophytic' microorganisms need not necessarily harm the plant. Instead, they are often beneficial in germination, growth, and defense. However, plant interiors also contain many ""secondary metabolites"", which are natural bioactive compounds that have strong antimicrobial properties, making this environment typically hostile for microorganisms. Now, for the first time ever, a research group consisting of Dr. Toshiki Furuya, Associate Professor at the Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Japan, has succeeded in isolating bacteria from the seeds of passion fruit (Passiflora edulis). Their research, which also unearths the surviving mechanisms of these bacteria inside the seeds, has been published in the journal MicrobiologyOpen. In their study, the scientists focused on the seeds of P. edulis. The seeds of this fruit are full of secondary metabolites with strong antimicrobial properties, such as resveratrol and piceatannol the latter present at high levels of up to 2.2 mg/g. As Dr. Furuya reveals the rationale behind choosing passion fruit seeds for the study, ""The extraordinarily high concentration of piceatannol protects P. edulis seeds from microorganisms. We thought it would be interesting to know if any endophytic microorganism could survive this extreme environment, and if yes, how."" Earlier reports showed that endophytes capable of surviving in an environment rich in biologically active compounds possessed biocatalytic activities related to the metabolism of these compounds. The fact that their biocatalytic potential could be exploited for therapeutic purposes made the scientists even more eager to explore the presence of endophytic bacteria. The scientists collected and surface-sterilized the seeds of naturally grown P. edulis before either cutting or crushing them and placing them on solid agar-based growth media to check for microbial growth. While no microbial colony appeared from the cut or homogenized seeds, interestingly, the seedlings sprouting from the cut seeds, when exposed to growth media, gave rise to microbial colonies. The scientists then performed sequencing to identify the bacteria that appeared on the agar plate. The findings were remarkable. From the seedlings, the scientists isolated 19 strains, including three previously unreported strains of bacteria from various genera. They hypothesized that inside the seeds, piceatannol exerted bacteriostatic (or ""bacterial growth-stalling"") rather than bactericidal (or ""bacteria-killing"") effects on the residing bacteria. Ms. Aoi Ishida, the co-author of the study explains: ""Due to the presence of a high concentration of piceatannol, the growth of the bacteria was stagnated inside the seed, but when transmitted to the next-generation seedlings during germination, the bacteria were relieved from the effect of piceatannol and able to grow again."" The scientists also found one of the bacteria, Brevibacterium sp. PE28-2, to possess the ability to convert resveratrol and piceatannol to their respective derivatives. This is the first endophyte shown to exhibit such activity. Dr. Furuya and Ms. Ishida are very hopeful that the method established in this study is expected to be effective in isolating several useful endophytic bacteria from a variety of plants. Moreover, considering the current focus on engineering new biomolecules with diverse applications, the results of this study would accelerate research on seed endophytic bacteria.ReferenceIshida A, Furuya T.

Hormone therapies for breast cancer have been one of the greatest success stories of molecularly targeted medicines. But a significant fraction of patients don t respond to these therapies,  says Kendall Nettles, PhD, associate professor of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, and lead author on the study published Friday afternoon in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There s a continued unmet medical need for better hormone therapies. This represents the first change in approach in 20 years,  Nettles says.Drugs like tamoxifen, fulvestrant or anastrozole are frequently prescribed for estrogen-sensitive breast cancers. But over time, some breast cancers can develop resistance, through inflammatory processes identified by Nettles  group and others in 2017, and through expression of resistance genes including EGFR.The compounds developed by Nettles and colleagues work by interfering with estrogen s ability to activate its cellular receptor in the traditional way, as seen with the hormone therapy tamoxifen, but also by a second inhibitory mechanism. Tests in cells showed greater efficacy in the presence of drug-resistance mechanisms, Nettles says.","Published: August 31, 2021"

Led by Professor Eric Chan from the NUS Department of Pharmacy, the team has identified three new urinary biomarkers that could be used to detect consumption of ADB-BUTINACA, an emerging synthetic cannabinoid which is a type of new psychoactive substance (NPS). The innovative approach used to identify the biomarkers can be applied to other existing and new synthetic cannabinoids.NPS are drugs designed to mimic the effects of illegal substances such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin,  Ice , Ecstacy and LSD. The intention of the clandestine laboratories to introduce synthetic cannabinoids with different chemical structures is to try to circumvent legislative bans. Over the past two years, users of NPS made up the third largest proportion of drug abusers in Singapore, while synthetic cannabinoids have dominated Singapore s NPS market for the past four years. As most synthetic cannabinoids are extensively metabolised in the body after consumption, they become virtually undetectable in urine samples. Commenting on the significance of the team s research, Prof Chan said,  Prior to our study, the metabolism and urinary biomarkers of ADB-BUTINACA were unclear. Our discovery and unique methodology offer assistance to the forensic fraternity who is constantly being challenged by the emergence of novel synthetic cannabinoids, and can also bring benefits to the international public communities to tackle the increasing abuse of this synthetic cannabinoid. This will bring us closer to the goal of having a drug-free world.  The study, which was carried out in collaboration with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of Singapore s Health Sciences Authority, was first published in the journal Clinical Chemistry on 13 August 2021. ADB-BUTINACA is a new synthetic cannabinoid that was first identified in Europe in 2019, and it entered Singapore s drug scene last year. Although three existing metabolites of ADB-BUTINACA are available as reference standards for routine forensic monitoring, they have been found to be absent or detected at lower concentrations in some urine samples of abusers. This created an impetus to identify other potential metabolites for use as urinary biomarkers for the cannabinoid s consumption. Instead of using the conventional and more time-consuming method of chemically synthesising metabolites of ADB-BUTINACA, Prof Chan and his team introduced an innovative method to identify the cannabinoid s unique metabolites using the concepts of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. The team synthesised key metabolites of ADB-BUTINACA using human liver enzymes in the laboratory for investigating their disposition and identifying novel biomarker metabolites in urine. From their studies, a total of 15 metabolites of ADB-BUTINACA and their respective pathways of biotransformation in the body were identified for the first time using this method. Of the 15 new metabolites, the researchers proposed four as urinary metabolite biomarkers due to their metabolic stability, including one metabolite where its reference standard is currently available. A panel comprising either one or a combination of these four newly-established urinary biomarkers was developed for diagnosing the consumption of ADB-BUTINACA. Moving forward, the team plans to extend their current strategy to better understand the disposition of novel metabolites of synthetic cannabinoids by kidneys and their eventual occurrence in urine.ReferenceSia CH, Wang Z, Goh EML, et al.

They have come up with a device that could identify a suite of gases, potentially including lethal ones, improving the safety of firefighters, miners, the military, and your local plumber. The work appeared in the journal, Nature. Infrared (IR) spectrometers are common laboratory equipment that can identify different materials by analysing their infrared signatures, which is invisible to the human eye. Just like an AM radio can be tuned to different frequencies of radio wave, IR spectrometers can be tuned to different wavelengths, giving a broad-spectrum analysis of a gas sample. However, these machines are bulky and expensive and not usually practical to take out of the laboratory and into the field.  Our new technology bonds a thin layer of black phosphorus crystals to a flexible, plastic-like substrate, allowing it to be bent in ways that cause the black phosphorus to emit light of different wavelengths essentially creating a tuneable infrared LED that allows for the detection of multiple materials,  University of Melbourne Professor Kenneth Crozier said.  This technology could fit inside smartphones and become part of everyday use.  For example, the bacteria found in meat release various gases as they multiply. The presence of these gases is a good indication that the meat is spoiling and is no longer fit for consumption.  The device placed inside a fridge could send a notification that meat is going off. When pointed at a handbag, it could reveal whether the bag is made of real leather or a cheaper substitute,  said Professor Crozier, who is also the Deputy Director of TMOS. Current materials that are used for IR photodetectors and light emitting devices can be difficult to manufacture, in large part due to the need for multiple layers of perfectly linked crystals. This new black phosphorus technology requires just one layer allowing  the device to be flexible, giving it unique properties when bent.  The shift in black phosphorus' emission wavelength with bending is really quite dramatic, enabling the LED to be tuned across the mid-infrared,  said Professor Ali Javey, from the University of California at Berkeley, whose group led the work. Importantly, the device could make the work of firefighters, miners and military safer, allowing them to identify potentially lethal gases from safe distances as the ultra-thin, ultra-light devices can be placed on small drones. Flying such a drone over a building fire could tell firefighters what dangers they face and equipment they ll need. The low-cost technology could also make its way into devices for use by plumbers and building managers.  Our IR photo detectors could be integrated into a camera so that we could look at our phone screen and  see  gas leaks or emissions and be able to determine what kind of gas it is,  Professor Crozier said.ReferenceKim H, Uddin SZ, Lien D-H, et al.

While these drugs work well, one drawback to them is that they have to be injected.A team of MIT engineers, in collaboration with scientists from Brigham and Women s Hospital and Novo Nordisk, is working on an alternative delivery strategy that could make it much easier for patients to benefit from monoclonal antibodies and other drugs that usually have to be injected. They envision that patients could simply swallow a capsule that carries the drug and then injects it directly into the lining of the stomach. If we can make it easier for patients to take their medication, then it is more likely that they will take it, and healthcare providers will be more likely to adopt therapies that are known to be effective,  says Giovanni Traverso, the Karl van Tassel Career Development Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women s Hospital.In a study appearing today in Nature Biotechnology, the researchers demonstrated that their capsules could be used to deliver not only monoclonal antibodies but also other large protein drugs such as insulin, in pigs.Traverso and Ulrik Rahbek, vice president at Novo Nordisk, are the senior authors of the paper.

The study analysed the reaction of dogs to odours and found that the dogs could predict when a seizure was imminent.  A reliable early warning system to make people with epilepsy aware of an impending seizure has the potential to save lives, reduce injury, provide an opportunity for medical intervention and return a sense of independence to those living with unpredictable seizures. Epilepsy is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening neurological condition which affects approximately 65 million people worldwide, of whom 30% (20 million), are unable to control their seizures by medication. There is currently no reliable and simple early warning seizure-onset device available, which means many people with unstable epilepsy live in fear of injury or sudden death and the negative impact of social stigmatization. There have been anecdotal accounts of pet dogs predicting their owner s epileptic seizures by becoming attentive and by demonstrating attention-seeking behaviours, but to date no scientific study has investigated the veracity of these claims. Lead researcher Dr Neil Powell (pictured below), from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen s University Belfast, said:  We hypothesized that, given the extraordinary sense of smell of dogs, a volatile organic compound exhaled by the dog s epileptic owner may provide an early warning trigger mechanism to which make dogs react before the seizure. The results have shown pet dogs to be a reliable source to detect an on-set seizure.  The study has been published in the journal MDPI Animals.The researchers explored how a cohort of pet dogs reacted to the emergence of seizure-associated odours. Using two specially designed pieces of apparatus called the Remote Odour Delivery Mechanism (RODM), the researchers separately delivered epileptic seizure-associated odours and nonseizure associated odours and recorded the reactions of the dogs to each. Using 19 pet dogs with no experience of epilepsy, the researchers exposed them to odours that were deemed to be characteristic of three seizure phases, by using sweat harvested from people with epilepsy. By altering the alternating odours emerging from sweat samples, captured before seizure, during a seizure and after a seizure, and two nonseizure controls, the researchers recorded the response of the 19 pet dogs. They found that all 19 dogs demonstrated more affiliative behavioural changes when confronted by seizure-associated odours, compared with their response to control odours.  Dr Powell added:  Our findings clearly showed that all dogs reacted to the seizure-associated odour whether this was through making eye contact with their owner, touching them, crying or barking. There is a unique volatile smell linked to epiletic seizures, detectable by dogs who can in-turn warn their owner a seizure is likely to occur.  ""Our research was based on pet dogs with no prior training. If we can train dogs, this has the potential to make a big difference to owners who experience unpredictable seizures and should go a long way in improving not only their safety, but also their quality of life.  The research was funded by and conducted in partnership with Epilepsy Ireland and Disability Assistance Dogs. Peter Murphy, CEO of Epilepsy Ireland, said:  A reliable method of seizure prediction and detection is the holy grail for many people living with epilepsy as well as the parents of children with the condition. This is especially the case where seizures involve the loss of consciousness, with a high risk of injury. While recent efforts have focused on technological solutions, it is exciting and very welcome news that anecdotal reports of dogs  ability to predict seizures have now been backed up by scientific evidence. We have been immensely proud to support Dr. Powell s work and we hope that the findings will lead to new approaches alongside  man s best friend  that promote safety and offer reassurance for people living with epilepsy.

The discovery reveals a novel signaling pathway that offers the bacterium a way in. We demonstrated the existence of conserved molecular machinery in this pathogen, specializing in xyloglucan. We elucidated at the biochemical and structural level the action of the machinery s enzymatic components. Our discovery of the mechanisms for deconstructing this carbohydrate points to possible applications in the bioeconomy and biorefining. We can obtain novel combinations of enzyme cocktails that are more effective in breaking down plant biomass to produce ethanol, aviation fuel and other chemicals, for example,  said M rio Tyago Murakami, principal investigator for the study. Murakami is Scientific Director of CNPEM s Biorenewables Laboratory (LNBR).CNPEM is already developing other microbial platforms for biorefining, such as an enzyme cocktail produced by a fungus (RUT-C30). The platform, for which a patent application has been filed, is customized for Brazilian conditions and has been tested in an industrial setting. It will be used in biorefineries to obtain advanced sugars from agroindustrial waste, with a reduced environmental impact and as a substitute for fossil fuels.According to Murakami, the discovery of novel components that potentiate plant infection also contributes to the development of strategies to combat citrus canker, including the production of inhibitors for this group of bacteria. Using the citrus canker pathogen as a model organism, we show that this system encompasses distinctive glycoside hydrolases, a modular xyloglucan acetylesterase and specific membrane transporters, demonstrating that plant-associated bacteria employ distinct molecular strategies from commensal gut bacteria to cope with xyloglucans , the article explains.  Together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning the intricate enzymatic machinery of Xanthomonas to depolymerize xyloglucans and uncover a role for this system in signaling pathways driving pathogenesis. Xanthomonas attacks other crops besides citruses, such as rice, cotton and banana. Considered one of the worst threats to citrus worldwide, citrus canker causes dark brown raised lesions on leaves and fruit, which drop prematurely, reducing the productivity of the affected plants. The blighted fruit is too unsightly to be sold, and once established, the disease can be controlled only by destroying all susceptible trees.Citrus canker expanded 15% in 2020 compared with the previous year in the states of S o Paulo and Minas Gerais, where most of Brazil s oranges are grown, and affected some 34 million plants, according to Fundecitrus, a research organization maintained by the industry. It blamed S o Paulo s decision not to eradicate symptomatic trees as one of the reasons for the expansion. It said 1.27 million 40 kg boxes of oranges were lost to citrus canker in the 2020-21 crop year.","Published: August 31, 2021"

If it gets mutated, a switch is flipped, and then they do have it.But it s not always that simple. Disease-related genes often have different degrees to which they are turned on or off. In these cases, there is a tipping point: With only an incremental biological change around a critical threshold, a person can go from having no symptoms to being very sick. The latest research on this topic from the Salk Institute has implications for studying and treating the underlying causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. The work, which was published in Neuron on August 26, 2021, could also be applicable to a wide range of diseases involving changes in gene expression levels, like cancer. This is increasingly becoming a new and very interesting direction for ALS research,  says Salk Professor Samuel Pfaff, the paper s senior author.  Our study is highly revealing in terms of how gene regulation occurs within neurons. While our experiments were done in mice, we believe these findings will also apply to humans. A handful of genes has been found in patients that are associated with ALS, a disease of the motor neurons that leads to paralysis. What many of these genes have in common is that they are linked to the manufacture of microRNAs (miRNAs) regulatory molecules that act like brakes to reduce the production of proteins. In the first part of this research, the team did a systematic review of past studies that profiled microRNA levels in patients with ALS. They found that across all the studies, the same microRNA, called miR-218, kept showing up as being lower, but not completely lost, in people with ALS. They decided to study why particular levels of miR-218 are important for motor neurons to do their job normally.In a mouse model of ALS, Salk researcher Neal Amin, now a clinical scholar and postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, devised a strategy to finely lower the levels of miR-218 in a controlled way to study the effects on motor neurons  control of muscle function. Amin found that there s a critical threshold somewhere between 36 percent and 7 percent of normal levels that leads to muscle paralysis and death. Above 36 percent, neuromuscular junctions are normal and healthy; below 7 percent, neuromuscular deficits are lethal. The rest of the study was focused on trying to understand why that was the case.It turns out that miR-218 regulates the function of about 300 different genes. Many of them encode proteins related to how motor neurons grow axons and send signals to muscle. Once the levels of miR-218 dropped below 36 percent, the way these neurons could signal to muscles dropped off dramatically. The researchers used cutting-edge tools in the lab to determine how miR-218 was influencing various genes. Instead of acting like a simple switch, the molecule miR-218 is like an orchestra conductor of 300 musicians playing together,  Amin says.  Instead of gradually telling all of the players to dim the volume of their instruments in unison, it s telling some musicians to play more quietly and others to stop completely. It has a much more dynamic and complex control over gene function than we ever previously appreciated. The researchers say that being able to study this fine-tuning in animal models will allow them to learn much more about how genetic mutations that reduce gene expression put patients at risk for developing brain disorders. This could eventually lead to new treatments that get at the heart of the biological changes that lead to disease. The research not only has implications for ALS, but for other diseases of the nervous system, including schizophrenia, which has also been associated with changes in the expression level of microRNAs. We think that these processes may also take place in other diseases related to genes and aging, including cancer,  says Pfaff, who holds the Benjamin H. Lewis Chair at Salk.  Having a new way to create animal models of how genetic disease begins and how it progresses will allow us to get at the underlying mechanisms and a deeper understanding of these complex activities.

By habit, you perform this sequence almost unconsciously. But then, one day, you stumble upon a shortcut. It s faster but involves learning and remembering a new set of keystrokes.In a study of rodents, scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai discovered that a part of the brain traditionally thought to control typing the old sequence may also play a critical role in learning the new one. The results, published on August 25th in Nature Communications, suggest that this process involves a delicate balance in the activity of two neighboring neural circuits: one dedicated to new actions and the other to old habits. For years scientists thought that habits and learning new, rewarding actions were most likely controlled by different parts of the brain. Surprisingly, we found that a brain area traditionally thought to specialize in the expression of old habits may also help the brain learn new actions,  said Paul J. Kenny, PhD, the Ward-Coleman Professor and Chair of the Nash Family Department of Neuroscience at Mount Sinai and the senior author of the paper.  Ultimately, we hope that these results provide new insights into the brain cells and circuits which underlie a variety of disorders that involve abnormalities in how our actions are controlled, including Parkinson s disease and drug addiction. The study was led by Alexander C. W. Smith, PhD, an instructor in the Kenny lab, and Sietse Jonkman, PhD, a former postdoctoral fellow at Mount Sinai.Action learning happens when doing something, like moving an object, produces a benefit, such as finding food or avoiding a foe. In this study, the researchers examined the role that the striatum plays in this type of learning. Located deep inside the brain, the striatum is known to be involved with controlling movements and actions. Although scientists have hypothesized that the striatum is involved in action learning, few have actually tested this idea,  said Dr. Jonkman.  We wanted to take an in-depth look at the striatal circuits that may be involved with action learning. To do this, the researchers tested the ability of hungry rodents to find food. On day one of the experiments, the rodents were put into a special cage and trained to earn food by pressing a dispenser lever. Each time an experimental rodent pressed the lever it received a food pellet whereas control rodents received none. Two days later, the researchers tested learning by putting the rodents back into the special cage. Once in the cage, the experimental rodents vigorously pressed the lever even though it no longer delivered food, indicating they had successfully learned the new action, whereas the control rodents would search all around and only press the lever a few times.At various times during the experiments, the researchers examined neural activity in the rodents  brains. They found that immediately after a training session, neurons in specific areas of the striatum were more active in experimental rodents than those in the control group. This was a period when the memory of the newly learned action is known to be stored, or encoded, in the brain for later use. Most notably, this was seen in the dorsolateral striatum, the posterior dorsomedial striatum, and the nucleus accumbens, suggesting these areas played a role in learning.To test this further, the researchers injected into each area a drug, anisomycin, which prevents cells from manufacturing the proteins required for long-term memory storage. The drug was injected either immediately after a training session or six hours later, a time when the new proteins required for memory storage should already have been produced. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that the drug only disrupted the ability of the animals to remember the new action when it was injected into the dorsolateral striatum immediately after the training session. Injections into any other areas had no effect on learning. We were surprised by these results. Traditionally, it is thought that action learning is encoded by the posterior dorsomedial striatum while the dorsolateral striatum only takes care of habits. But that is not what we saw,  said Dr. Smith.  Instead our results suggested that in addition to regulating habits, the dorsolateral striatum also consolidates action learning immediately after the new action has been learned. Further experiments supported this idea. For instance, chemically blocking the activity of neurons in the dorsolateral striatum soon after a training session also prevented the rodents from remembering to use the lever to retrieve food.Finally, when the researchers took a closer look at this area, they found that learning may be controlled by two neighboring and counteracting neural circuits known to respond to the neurotransmitter dopamine. In one circuit, the activity of cells called D1 receptor medium spiny neurons rose immediately after training, and inhibiting these cells hindered learning. In contrast, the activity of the other cells, called D2 receptor medium spiny neurons, quieted after training and blocking their activity enhanced the ability of the animals to remember the new action. In a separate set of experiments the researchers found that blocking D2 neuron activity prevented the rodents from displaying previously learned habits. Our results suggest that there is a delicate balance between new action learning and the expression of old habits, which is controlled by the yin-yang activity of two different populations of neurons in the dorsolateral striatum,  said Dr. Kenny.  In the future, we plan to study how disruption of this balance contributes to maladaptive actions in brain disorders. Reference: Smith ACW, Jonkman S, Difeliceantonio AG, et al.

Participants were then left for five months to do whatever they presumed would benefit their fitness and health. After this period all were contacted and asked if they would consider completing an ultra-marathon.Fifteen participants went on to express an interest in attempting an ultra-marathon as they continued to improve their fitness. Seven were randomly assigned FIT, while eight continued with just MI.MI is a technique that sees a counsellor support someone to develop, highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change, and their reasons for wanting to change. Functional Imagery Training builds on MI, as it teaches clients how to elicit and practice motivational imagery themselves, with participants encouraged to utilise all their senses to visualise how it would feel to achieve their goal.Of the eight participants in the MI only group, four started the race, and two finished. Meanwhile, all seven of the FIT group started, and six finished   showing that those assigned to the technique were five times more likely to complete the challenge.While researchers acknowledge the small population size, the study, published in the Journal of Imagery Research in Sport and Physical Activity, adds to the growing body of evidence that FIT can significantly reinforce a person s motivation to complete a challenging goal.FIT has also previously been shown to boost weight loss, with another Plymouth-led study showing that overweight people who used it lost an average of five times more weight than those using motivational interviewing alone.Developed at the University of Plymouth, FIT is a unique approach to behaviour change that uses mental imagery to motivate change.It teaches people new ways of thinking about their immediate future to help them stay motivated as they achieve each small step towards their goal   with users describing it as a  mindset shift , where they exercised because they wanted to, rather than feeling they had to.For example, at difficult points in the race, a participant in the new study   a teacher   pictured the conversation they would have at work on Monday morning: visualising the staff room, holding a coffee in hand, imagining the smell and the taste, talking about the challenges with a peer, then using this self-developed image to imagine the feeling at the finish line, as they go from little exercise to ultra-athlete.Lead author Dr Jon Rhodes, who has worked with professional athletes to improve their resilience, said: An ultra-marathon requires a huge amount of mental, as well as physical, strength   even from people who run regularly. Trialling Functional Imagery Training on historically self-professed non-runners was a real test of its efficacy, and to see that it made a difference was a promising finding. It shows that multi-sensory imagery is the key difference between those who reach the starting line and then go on to finish, and those who do not   showing it is critical to maintaining changes and pushing the boundaries of physical and mental performance. Melissa King, aged 38 from Newquay in Cornwall, was allocated the FIT intervention as she prepared for the Exmoor Ultra Marathon earlier this year. Completing the event successfully, she said:  My honest reason for starting running in the first place was just to see if I could do it. FIT has been a huge mindset shift, and I now use imagery as a way to reset; to ground me and help me to focus on being present, appreciating why I am here while also prompting me to cue my immediate, medium- and long-term goals. ""Having never run before, my ultimate aim is now a running trip in South America which will take a couple of months. It s in three years  time, so I m starting training early and really embracing the challenge. Professor Jon May is one of the co-creators of FIT, and co-author on the paper. He added:  FIT is based on two decades of research showing that mental imagery is more strongly emotionally charged than other types of thought. It uses imagery to strengthen people s motivation and confidence to achieve their goals, and teaches people how to do this for themselves, so they can stay motivated even when faced with challenges. ""We were very excited to see that the intervention helped people to complete their ultra-marathon, and look forward to seeing further studies on the effectiveness of FIT as a motivational technique within sport and beyond.

This strategy is all about dodging bullies and getting better access to food. The findings were published today in the journal Current Biology. [LINK]""What's interesting about the White-necked Jacobin is that all the juveniles start out with male-like plumage,"" explains lead author Jay Falk. ""Among most other bird species, juvenile plumage looks more like the female's, presumably to be less obvious to predators."" Falk did this work while a Ph.D. student with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and is currently at the University of Washington.As the birds mature, all the jacobin males retain the fancier plumage but so do nearly 20% of the females among the population Falk studied in Panama. The remaining 80% of females still develop the muted green and white coloration of a typical adult female. Though plumage ornamentation is usually attributed to sexual selection and attracting a mate, researchers ruled out that explanation for this species after field experiments. Scientists observed the reactions of live jacobin hummingbirds toward stuffed mounts placed on nectar feeders during breeding season. The mounts were stuffed specimens adult White-necked Jacobin males, typical adult females, and female adults that looked like males.""If females having male-like plumage is the result of sexual selection, then the males would have been drawn to the male-plumaged females,"" says Falk. ""That didn t happen. The male White-necked Jacobins still showed a clear preference for the typically plumed adult females."" So, what's the benefit to females of this species when they look like a male? To get to the root of that puzzle, Falk and his assistants put radio frequency ID tags on birds and set up a circuit of 28 feeders wired to read the tags. By tracking the number and length of visits, they honed in the answer.""Our tests found that the typical, less colorful females were harassed much more than females with male-like plumage,"" Falk says. ""Because the male-plumaged females experienced less aggression, they were able to feed more often a clear advantage.""The researchers found that the male-like females got to feed longer than the typical adult female about 35% longer at feeders filled with high-sugar nectar. That can make a big difference because hummingbirds have the highest metabolic rate of any vertebrate. They need to eat constantly in order to survive. Bottom line: female White-necked Jacobins retain the male-like plumage of their youth for social reasons they avoid the bullies by looking like them. It is still not clear whether male-like females behave just as aggressively as the males. The actual physical mechanism that allows females to retain male-like plumage is also not known.The White-necked Jacobin is hardly alone when it comes to having some females that look like males. Falk says studies have found that 25% of the world s 350+ hummingbird species also have some females that look like males.Reference: Falk JJ, Webster MS, Rubenstein DR.

The researchers found that a group of proteins represented by TNFR1 were associated with slower decline in the very early stage of Alzheimer s, while another protein called TREM2 was only useful once dementia set in.Alzheimer s disease is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 or older. Although scientists have been able to diagnose the disease for many years, they have been unable to identify when people with the earliest cognitive symptoms will show progression of the disease.Researchers say this is the first study that provides insight into how Alzheimer s disease progresses that can be readily deployed in the clinic. For many families, knowing whether they have a slow or fast form of the disease for a loved one will better assist in customizing treatment plans. For many years, the ability to identify the slower or faster progression of Alzheimer s disease eluded the medical community,  said William Hu, an associate professor and chief of cognitive neurology at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  We hope our study will provide many families with the ease and ability to make certain plans for their loved ones and to bring some equity when undergoing tests during the initial diagnosis of the disease. Researchers say testing for Alzheimer s and these inflammatory proteins from a single spinal fluid procedure will eliminate unnecessary testing routines, including repeated PET scans, that many Alzheimer s patients go through.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Alzheimer s is the most common type of dementia, with more than 5.8 million Americans living with the disease. The CDC estimates this number will double every five years for people beyond age 65.Dr. Hu is working with Rutgers Innovation Ventures to turn this discovery into a clinical test, and design clinical trials to explore the findings of this study further.Reference: Hu WT, Ozturk T, Kollhoff A, Wharton W, Christina Howell J.

Although several studies have looked at commercial composts, very few have investigated backyard compost samples. In a new study, researchers have measured the number of pathogens in both types of compost. The main difference between backyard and commercial compost is the composition. Backyard compost is made from plant-based materials like vegetable scraps and coffee grounds because online tutorials recommend them. Additionally, animal-source materials are harder to compost. On the other hand, many of the commercial composts are made from farm manure,  said Yuqing Mao, a graduate student in the Nguyen lab.Regardless of the source, the process of composting usually, but not always, gets rid of pathogens because it involves multiple stages of high heat.  There may be some pathogens that survive, either because they are heat resistant or they get introduced at a later stage,  Mao said.The researchers collected samples of backyard compost from two gardeners at Urbana-Champaign and used six types of commercial compost, which were bought from the supermarket. They also used two control samples: soil that has never been treated with compost and immature compost, which has not been put through the high-temperature treatment. They extracted DNA samples and used qPCR to identify and measure the abundance of specific genes. We looked at airborne and foodborne pathogens. People are usually more concerned with the latter because they use the compost to grow vegetables,  Mao said. The researchers looked at the foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica and the airborne pathogens Mycobacterium spp., Legionella pneumophila, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Since bacteria have very long DNA sequences, the study focused on genetic markers genes that are unique to each organism. We did not find any Salmonella in our samples and E. coli was only present in the immature compost sample, meaning that if the compost is made properly, it is unlikely that they will get contaminated by foodborne pathogens,  Mao said.  On the other hand, we found that L. pneumophilia was present in four of the commercial samples but not in the other samples. The other two airborne pathogens were found in both backyard and commercial compost samples. Unfortunately, the qPCR method cannot distinguish between live and dead pathogens. The researchers hope that they can improve the method to detect only the viable cells so that they can better assess the threat to humans. Additionally, they would like to study more samples to validate their conclusions.The group also looked at the number of antibiotic resistance genes across the samples. Bacterial communities that have higher frequencies of these genes are more likely to spread them, resulting in a dangerous problem.  Overall, the immature compost samples have the highest abundance of antibiotic resistance genes, indicating that the high heat during composting may degrade some of these genes,  Mao said.It is unclear how the airborne pathogens are finding their way into the compost samples. The researchers are now trying to understand the source of contamination better so that they can help protect gardeners.  We also want to look at what composting conditions work best to remove these pathogens and the antibiotic resistance genes,  said Helen Nguyen (IGOH), Ivan Racheff Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering.Mao has prepared a set of guidelines for gardeners who are interested in using animal manure composting, which can be found here.Reference: Mao Y, Akdeniz N, Nguyen TH.

Similarly, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have discovered that nanoparticles of gold act unusually when close to the edge of a one-atom thick sheet of carbon, called graphene. This could have big implications for the development of new sensors and quantum devices.This discovery was made possible with a newly established ultrafast electron microscope (UEM) at Argonne s Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a DOE Office of Science User Facility.  The UEM enables the visualization and investigation of phenomena at the nanoscale and on time frames of less than a trillionth of a second. This discovery could make a splash in the growing field of plasmonics, which involves light striking a material surface and triggering waves of electrons, known as plasmonic fields. For years, scientists have been pursuing development of plasmonic devices with a wide range of applications   from quantum information processing to optoelectronics (which combine light-based and electronic components) to sensors for biological and medical purposes. To do so, they couple two-dimensional materials with atomic-level thickness, such as graphene, with nanosized metal particles. Understanding the combined plasmonic behavior of these two different types of materials requires understanding exactly how they are coupled. In a recent study from Argonne, researchers used ultrafast electron microscopy to look directly at the coupling between gold nanoparticles and graphene.  Surface plasmons are light-induced electron oscillations on the surface of a nanoparticle or at an interface of a nanoparticle and another material,  said Argonne nanoscientist Haihua Liu.  When we shine a light on the nanoparticle, it creates a short-lived plasmonic field. The pulsed electrons in our UEM interact with this short-lived field when the two overlap, and the electrons either gain or lose energy. Then, we collect those electrons that gain energy using an energy filter to map the plasmonic field distributions around the nanoparticle.  In studying the gold nanoparticles, Liu and his colleagues discovered an unusual phenomenon. When the nanoparticle sat on a flat sheet of graphene, the plasmonic field was symmetric. But when the nanoparticle was positioned close to a graphene edge, the plasmonic field concentrated much more strongly near the edge region.  It s a remarkable new way of thinking about how we can manipulate charge in the form of a plasmonic field and other phenomena using light at the nanoscale,  Liu said.  With ultrafast capabilities, there s no telling what we might see as we tweak different materials and their properties.  This whole experimental process, from the stimulation of the nanoparticle to the detection of the plasmonic field, occurs in less than a few hundred quadrillionths of a second.  The CNM is unique in housing a UEM that is open for user access and capable of taking measurements with nanometer spatial resolution and sub-picosecond time resolution,  said CNM Director Ilke Arslan.  Having the ability to take measurements like this in such a short time window opens up the examination of a vast array of new phenomena in non-equilibrium states that we haven t had the ability to probe before. We are excited to provide this capability to the international user community.  The understanding gained with regard to the coupling mechanism of this nanoparticle-graphene system should be key to the future development of exciting new plasmonic devices.ReferenceLiu H, Gage TE, Singh P, et al.

The study, led by Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed) and Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, begins to outline gene activity patterns that could serve as early warning indicators for cardiovascular disease. We shouldn t expect it to be same for every population group,  said Associate Professor Shelley Cole, Ph.D., senior author and co-lead of the Population Health Program at Texas Biomed.  There are some universal factors affecting risk for heart disease, where you live in the world, your environment, your lifestyle, your access to health care, those all influence disease risk and progression. Advances in querying the entire genome or DNA of an individual, and statistical analyses, coupled with large, long-term studies are enabling us to see those influences on the genetic level for different populations. External influences that leave a mark on DNA are part of the growing field called epigenetics. Essentially, modifications occur that affect how DNA is expressed, without changing the basic genetic code. Identifying epigenetic patterns associated with particular diseases could one day help screen for illness years or even decades before symptoms develop. In this study, we harness the country s best clinical data on heart disease from diverse populations to begin to unlock the specific epigenetic changes involved the complex biology that leads to disease,  said Ana Navas-Acien, M.D., Ph.D., the study s first author and professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.Navas-Acien, Cole and their collaborators compiled data from nearly 9,400 participants in four long-term health studies: the Strong Heart Study, which has studied cardiovascular disease among American Indians since the 1980s; the Women s Health Initiative, which follows African-American, Hispanic and white women across the U.S.; the Framingham Heart Study, which follows men and women in Massachusetts; and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), which follows men and women in four U.S. communities. (For this study, the ARIC data was split into two cohorts: Black and white.)Researchers analyzed the entire genome of each person for DNA methylation, which causes changes to DNA activity without altering the genetic sequence, and compared that with individuals known to have developed coronary heart disease. Among the Strong Heart Study volunteers, there were about 505 methylation points associated with heart disease.Those sites were compared with the other cohorts. Only 33 were also found in three additional groups with mixed results   sometimes a common site was associated with heart disease, while other times, it was actually associated with a lower risk of heart disease. This underscores the need to tailor indicators of risk and resilience, as well as interventions and treatments, for subpopulations as we move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and towards precision medicine,  said Cole, who chairs the Strong Heart Study Steering Committee and directs the Strong Heart Study Genetics Center.By incorporating data from the Strong Heart Study, which involves 12 tribes in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North and South Dakota, this paper successfully brings advanced genetic analyses to traditionally underserved, rural populations. It can be challenging to do field research with remote population groups that don t have easy access to hospitals and clinics, so they are often left out of research projects like this,  Cole said.  The Strong Heart Study is providing extremely valuable insights for the participating tribes as well as for the broader global community about how environmental factors influence our health.

Chan School of Public Health answers that question.The research, which assessed the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, is based on analysis of data from nearly 2 million individuals in Israel and represents one of the largest real-world assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety to date.The findings, the researchers said, affirm the overall safety of the vaccine and underscore that the risk of adverse consequences from actual infection with SARS-CoV-2 far outweighs potential vaccine risks.The study involved two analyses: A comparison of adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and between unvaccinated people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and unvaccinated noninfected people.The study showed that few adverse events were associated with the vaccine. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, the most serious of them, was rare, with a rate of 2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated people. This means that for every 100,000 individuals, 2.7 more cases of myocarditis occurred than would be expected, the researchers said.By contrast, the risk of myocarditis was notably higher among infected but unvaccinated individuals, occurring at a rate of 11 excess cases per 100,000 people.Coronavirus infection but not vaccination was also associated with greatly increased risk of pericarditis (an inflammation of the area around the heart), heart arrhythmias, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, acute kidney damage, among others. To date, one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding potential side effects of the vaccine,  said study co-author Ben Reis, HMS assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston Children s Hospital and director of the predictive medicine group in the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children s. This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on vaccine safety, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination. Those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects, such as myocarditis, should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals,  Reis said.The results are based on records from Clalit Health Services in Israel, one of the world s largest integrated health record databases. The analysis is the largest peer-reviewed evaluation of the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in a nationwide mass-vaccination setting.             The extensive nationwide rollout of Israel s COVID-19 vaccination campaign provided the Clalit Research Institute with a unique opportunity to assess, through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets, the safety of the vaccine in a real-world setting, without needing to rely on individual-driven active reporting of side effects  said study senior author Ran Balicer, director of the Clalit Research Institute and Chief Innovation Officer for Clalit.  These results show convincingly that this mRNA vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of  natural  morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant, higher, and much more common risk of serious adverse events. The results of this real-world study confirm, complement, and build on the previously reported findings of the Pfizer/BioNTech phase 3 randomized clinical trial, which involved 21,720 individuals, the researchers noted. The comprehensive nature of this new analysis and the sheer volume of data involved offer a more detailed assessment of the vaccine s safety across a wider range of adverse events. These data should facilitate informed individual risk-benefit decision-making, and, in our view, make a strong argument in favor of opting in to get vaccinated, especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread,  added Balicer, who also serves as chairman of Israel s National Expert Advisory Team on COVID-19 response.Previous efforts to characterize vaccine safety have relied on voluntary active reporting by vaccinated individuals, known to be incomplete. The new study relies on the analysis of millions of anonymized electronic medical records, which are far more comprehensive.In an effort to provide the proper context that is critical for interpreting vaccine safety findings, the researchers also examine a wide range of adverse events both among vaccinated individuals and among unvaccinated individuals who were infected with the coronavirus, conducting two parallel analyses, assessing the occurrence of 25 adverse events in each of these groups.In the vaccinated subgroup, the researchers compared the outcomes of 884,828 vaccinated individuals 16 years and older with those of 884,828 unvaccinated individuals based on an extensive set of sociodemographic, geographic, and health-related characteristics. This analysis took place from Dec. 20, 2020, the launch of Israel s national vaccination campaign, through May 24, 2021. Some individuals switched groups based on their changing vaccination status, with 235,541 people moving from the unvaccinated group into the vaccinated group during the study.To provide context for the vaccine safety findings above, a separate analysis was conducted among unvaccinated individuals. This analysis estimated rates of the same 25 potential adverse events among 173,106 unvaccinated individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared with 173,106 carefully matched controls not infected with SARS-CoV-2. This analysis took place from March 1, 2020, the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, through May 24, 2021.The vaccine was found to be safe: Out of 25 potential side effects examined. four were found to have a link with the vaccine.Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle associated with the vaccine was rare 2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated individuals. These events were observed mainly among males between the ages of 20 and 34.In contrast, myocarditis was far more common among unvaccinated individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The analysis showed 11 excess cases of myocarditis per 100,000 infected individuals.Other adverse events moderately associated with vaccination were swelling of the lymph nodes, a mild side effect that is part of a standard immune response to vaccination, with 78 excess cases per 100,000, appendicitis with 5 excess cases per 100,000, likely as a result of swelling of lymph nodes around the appendix. Reactivation of dormant herpes zoster (chickenpox virus) infection occurred in 16 cases per 100,000.These small numbers of adverse events among vaccinated individuals stood in stark contrast with the high rate of multiple and more serious adverse events among unvaccinated individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. These included cardiac arrhythmias (a 3.8-fold increase above baseline risk with 166 cases per 100,000 infected patients); kidney damage (14.8-fold increase with 125 excess cases per 100,000); pericarditis (5.4-fold increase with 11 excess cases per 100,000); pulmonary embolism (12.1-fold increase with 62 excess cases per 100,000); deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot in the veins (3.8-fold increase with 43 excess cases per 100,000); myocardial infarction, or heart attack (4.5-fold increase with 25 excess cases per 100,000); and stroke (2.1-fold increase with 14 excess cases per 100,000).Reference: Barda N, Dagan N, Ben-Shlomo Y, et al.

The preliminary research is presented at ESC Congress 2021.1Study author Dr. Rebecca Kelly of the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK said:  The association seen between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease risk in observational studies has previously been unclear; our findings are important because they provide a possible explanation   that the relationship may vary depending on the food source. We found that saturated fat from meat may be associated with a higher risk than other food sources   in part because those consuming large amounts of meat also had a higher body mass index (BMI) than low consumers.  Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.2 Eating higher amounts of saturated fat is linked to elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or  bad  cholesterol,3,4 which increases risk of cardiovascular disease.5 There is some evidence that different types of foods rich in saturated fat, particularly meat and dairy, may have differing associations with cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this study examined how saturated fat from various foods relates to ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and total cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke combined). The study included 114,285 UK Biobank participants who were free of cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. Participants completed dietary assessments asking what they ate the day before to estimate their usual intake of total saturated fat and saturated fat from different foods (e.g. dairy and meat). They also completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire and had blood samples and body measurements taken. The researchers tracked participants for around 8.5 years using information from linked hospital and death records to find out whether they developed cardiovascular disease. During the follow-up period, total cardiovascular disease, heart disease, and stroke occurred in 4,365, 3,394 and 1,041 participants, respectively. The data were analysed to assess if there were any links between intake of total saturated fat and saturated fat from different foods and cardiovascular disease outcomes. The analyses accounted for multiple lifestyle, socioeconomic and medical factors.  There were no clear associations between total saturated fat and cardiovascular disease outcomes. However, consuming 5% higher total energy from saturated fat from meat was associated with 19% and 21% elevated risks of total cardiovascular disease and heart disease, respectively   but the associations did not remain significant after accounting for BMI. Researchers also found that associations of SFA from dairy with heart disease went in the opposite direction, but this association was not clear after accounting for BMI. Dr. Kelly said:  Our results suggest that differences in BMI may be responsible, in part, for the association between cardiovascular disease and saturated fat from meat. It is not possible to determine whether this is because of a specific impact of saturated fat from meat on BMI or because those with a higher BMI consume more meat. In addition, it is difficult to fully disentangle whether part of the effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease may be through higher LDL cholesterol in this cohort because cholesterol-lowering medication use is high in UK adults.  Dr. Kelly concluded:  We recommend following the dietary guidelines advice to consume less than 10% of daily energy from saturated fat. Our findings emphasise the importance of studying the different food sources of saturated fat when examining risk of cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to ensure that these observations were not influenced by dietary or non-dietary factors that were not measured in this study.

[This study] illustrates that genes don t code for a particular disorder or outcome; there are no genes  for  substance use disorder, or  for  behavior problems,  said joint senior author Danielle Dick, Ph.D., Distinguished Commonwealth Professor of Psychology and Human and Molecular Genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University.  Instead, genes influence the way our brains are wired, which can make us more at risk for certain outcomes. In this case, we find that there are genes that broadly influence self-control or impulsivity, and that this predisposition then confers risk for a variety of life outcomes. The study,  Multivariate Analysis of 1.5 Million People Identifies Genetic Associations with Traits Related to Self-Regulation and Addiction,  was published today in the journal Nature Neuroscience and was conducted by a consortium of 26 researchers at 17 institutions in the United States and the Netherlands.It was led by Dick; Philipp Koellinger, Ph.D., professor of social science genetics at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Kathryn Paige Harden, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin; and Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego.The study is one of the largest genome-wide association studies ever conducted, pooling data from an effective sample size of 1.5 million people of European descent. The researchers  genetic risk score has one of the largest effect sizes   a measurement of the prediction power   of any genetic risk score for a behavioral outcome to date. It demonstrates the far-reaching effects of carrying a genetic liability toward lower self-control, impacting many important life outcomes,  said Dick, a professor in the Department of Psychology in the College of Humanities and Sciences and the Department Human and Molecular Genetics in the School of Medicine at VCU.  We hope that a greater understanding of how individual genetic differences contribute to vulnerability can reduce stigma and blame surrounding many of these behaviors, such as behavior problems in children and substance use disorders. The identification of the more than 500 genetic loci is important, the researchers said, because it provides new insight into our understanding of behaviors and disorders related to self-regulation, collectively referred to as  externalizing  and that have a shared genetic liability. We know that regulating behavior is a critical component of many important life outcomes   from substance use and behavioral disorders, like ADHD, to medical outcomes ranging from suicide to obesity, to educational outcomes like college completion,  Dick said.Characterizing the genetic contributions to self-regulation can be helpful in myriad ways, she said. It allows us to better understand the biology behind why some people are more at risk, which can assist with medication development, and it can allow us to know who is more at risk, so we can put early intervention and prevention programs in place,  she said.  Identifying genetic risk factors is a critical component of precision medicine, which has the goal of using information about an individual s genetic and environmental risk factors to deliver more tailored, effective intervention specific to that individual s risk profile. The researchers noted, however, that having a higher risk profile isn t necessarily a bad thing. For example, CEOs, entrepreneurs and fighter pilots are often higher on risk taking,  Dick said.  DNA is not destiny. We all have unique genetic codes, and we re all at risk for something; but understanding one s predisposition can be empowering   it can help individuals understand their strengths, and their potential challenges, and act accordingly.

Although plastic-free, sustainable paper products are available, they often let grease and oil pass through, weakening the paper and creating a mess. Today, scientists report they have developed a degradable polymer coating that can block this seepage and could lead to new biodegradable, paper-based materials.The researchers will present their results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. ""Consumers are driving a push to more sustainable products,  says Matthew Carter, Ph.D., principal investigator on the project.  But making a fully degradable paper product for single-use applications   like the sandwich wrappers, bowls and trays you get at a cafeteria   is a big challenge,  adds Carter, who is presenting the work at the meeting. Current oil- and grease-resistant coatings for disposable paper products often include fluorocarbons or polyolefins, but those polymers are environmentally persistent and can t be composted.  One of the things that makes conventional polymers useful is their durability,  says his fellow principal investigator, Andrew Hejl, Ph.D., who works with Carter at Dow. That toughness, which originates in the stable carbon-carbon bonds that form during polymerization, is desirable in, say, a latex-based house paint that must last for years but problematic in a paper bowl destined for composting. One way to make polymers less durable is to insert degradable linkages to disrupt their carbon-carbon backbones, Carter says. To do so, the researchers turned to a free radical polymerization technique that had been around for years but hadn t been widely adopted. Noticing a recent resurgence of interest in academia for using this technique with cyclic ketene acetal and vinyl monomers, the Dow team began exploring how to translate this chemistry to an industrial setting. In academia, the reaction was typically carried out in organic solvents, but Dow wanted to switch to water as a  greener  substitute. That was difficult because cyclic ketene acetal monomers are unstable in water, but the researchers addressed that problem by tweaking reaction conditions, including pH, temperature and monomer concentration. Their reaction mixed the cyclic ketene acetal 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and vinyl acetate to form a polymer with ester linkages in the backbone. The team then coated paper with a water-based emulsion of this polymer   a synthetic  latex  unrelated to natural latex rubber, and therefore unlikely to trigger an allergic reaction   and let it dry. They recently reported that the coating provided an effective barrier against oil and grease, and that its ester linkages could break apart in water, quite slowly at neutral pH but faster at higher pH under lab conditions. Now, the researchers are beginning to assess the coating s degradability under industrially relevant conditions. So far they have shown that microorganisms that are used in industrial composters can help biodegrade the polymer in simulated wastewater.  The concept is to have a long polymer that breaks down into smaller pieces that will ultimately get broken down by microbes into CO2,  Hejl says. Other researchers and companies have developed biodegradable food service products with coatings based on natural materials such as whey or chitosan.  Those are great options, but they have limitations in terms of getting the performance you want at an appropriate price point,  Hejl says. And some coatings have to be applied as a very dilute solution, so a lot of water has to be evaporated to dry them, he adds.  So there are a lot of potential materials, and I don't think that anything yet has checked off every box.  But the Dow researchers believe their coating might just fill the bill.  More broadly, if you look at the concept of interrupting a stable carbon-carbon backbone with degradable linkages, that really opens up a lot of opportunities beyond just paper coatings,  Carter says.  Other applications include personal care or home care formulations, like shampoo and floor polish. Many of these materials currently contain synthetic carbon-carbon bond polymers. So this approach could be a powerful way to introduce degradability to new classes of materials in the future.

One appealing alternative to common petrochemical processes that generate significant greenhouse gases and other waste products could come from biological systems.Recent work from Northwestern Engineering s Michael Jewett and researchers from the University of Texas at Austin has led to advances in understanding of biochemical pathways and increased rates of chemical production by biological systems. The findings could bring us closer to implementing sustainable alternatives to synthesizing materials, fuels, and other oil-derived products.The paper  An Integrated In Vivo/In Vitro Framework to Enhance Cell-Free Biosynthesis with Metabolically Rewired Yeast Extracts,  published Aug. 26 in the journal Nature Communications, describes the development of optimized in vitro biosynthesis (biochemical production) processes that use cell extracts from engineered strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewer s yeast). Along with Jewett, Walter P. Murphy Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering, the paper was written by Blake Rasor, a PhD student in Jewett s lab. The investigation was conducted in collaboration with the research group of Hal Alper, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.The work was supported through the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute s Emerging Technologies Opportunity Program (ETOP). The ETOP provides funding to seed the development of new technologies offered to those researchers worldwide who tap JGI s user programs to advance energy and environmental applications.Decades of metabolic studies and genetic tool development make S. cerevisiae a highly controllable framework for biochemical production. Beyond historical applications in baking and brewing, this yeast has been engineered to produce innumerable target molecules used in industrial and therapeutic applications.However, cellular production systems have an internal tug-of-war between making more cells and making the engineered product. Jewett s group avoids these growth and viability constraints by breaking the biological machinery out of cells and using the extracted material for cell-free biochemical reactions, which enables the optimization of levers that are not easily tuned in living cells.Previously, cell-free biosynthesis efforts with crude cell extracts have primarily used unmodified strains of E. coli. The researchers expanded the scope of this technique by using extracts from S. cerevisiae and by incorporating cellular metabolic engineering techniques to enhance the biosynthetic potential of cell-free reactions. This demonstrates that metabolic rewiring in cells produces extracts with greater volumetric outputs than wildtype (unchanged) extracts and the corresponding cell cultures.Specifically, the cell-free production of three chemical products (butanediol, glycerol, itaconic acid) at a rate up to 10 times faster than corresponding cellular approaches points to the flexibility and efficacy of integrating cellular engineering with cell-free biosynthesis. This could expand the breadth of biological platforms underpinning efforts in sustainability,  Rasor said. Our work further joins an emerging area of science that seeks to use cell-free systems from crude cell extracts for designing cellular function, on-demand biomanufacturing, and portable diagnostics,  said Jewett, director of the Center for Synthetic Biology.  Indeed, these efforts are expanding the definition of biomanufacturing to build a sustainable bioeconomy. As for next steps, Jewett said he and his collaborators are building on this work both for pathway prototyping in the context of altered metabolism and for cell-free biomanufacturing to complement current cell-based approaches. Expanding the integrated cell/cell-free metabolic engineering strategy to yeast strains producing other value-added biochemical products and increasing the scale of cell-free reactions could spearhead the development of sustainable, economically viable alternatives to current chemical production processes,  he said.Reference: Rasor BJ, Yi X, Brown H, Alper HS, Jewett MC.

A career spent dealing with traumatic events led to post-traumatic stress disorder and insomnia.

He was invited to chair the community advisory board for the largest trial of telepsychiatry to date.The five-year study, published Aug. 25 in JAMA Psychiatry, found that telepsychiatry in rural, federally qualified health centers was a resounding success for patients who had screened positive for bipolar disorder and/or PTSD.The trial was called The Study to Promote Innovation in Rural Integrated Telepsychiatry (SPIRIT). It was designed to identify the best approach to delivering tele-mental health services to rural primary-care clinics. The results of our trial showed that if you give access to high-quality care for patients who are underserved, they improve their quality of life,  said lead researcher Dr. John Fortney, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine.The 1,004 participants were enrolled from 24 federally qualified health centers in Washington, Arkansas and Michigan.Without telepsychiatry, most of these patients would likely not receive help from a mental health specialist for these complex psychiatric disorders, the researchers said.In fact, only one-third of individuals with bipolar disorder and PTSD receive specialty mental health care in a year, the researchers wrote.  They said in primary care settings, only 10% of patients with these disorders receive adequate care.Nolan had originally enrolled in the study that led to this trial called Telemedicine for Outreach for PTSD at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Little Rock, also overseen by Fortney. It made a huge difference in my life,  he said.As the SPIRIT trial wound down, Nolan said he could hear the hope and relief in the voices of participants who shared their stories in a video documentary.","Published: August 26, 2021"

Both are common coping responses to stress.The research team were aiming to establish whether reducing these responses could improve physical health and health behaviours - actions people take that affect their health in both positive and negative ways, like exercising and healthy eating, or smoking and excessive alcohol intake.Lead researcher Dane McCarrick, a postgraduate researcher in Psychology at the University of Leeds, said:  This new research provides the first synthesis of experimental evidence testing the most effective methods at reducing worry and rumination within the context of health. The review provides fresh evidence for the link between stress and adverse health outcomes and highlights the importance of finding time to switch off and manage worry. Stress is known to impact physical health, and can increase blood pressure, heart rate and cardiovascular activity, lower the immune system, affect hormone levels and produce physical symptoms, including pain and nausea.The research team used data from 5,000 participants across 36 different studies to examine how psychological interventions for worry and rumination impacted mental and physical health and health behaviours over a period of time.The results were compared with control groups who received no intervention.Interventions included: The results showed that all intervention types had a significant, positive effect on health behaviours, with the exception of pain management strategies.Delivery methods and settings, such as professionally-led or group therapy were also assessed.The team found that levels of worry and rumination were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, with larger effects produced when interventions were administered by a healthcare professional. Action planning, psychological detachment and CBT produced significant effects on worry, while mindfulness, psychological detachment, CBT and pain management produced significant results for rumination.The research, jointly conducted by Mr McCarrick, Dr Andrew Prestwich, Dr. Arianna Prudenzi and Professor Daryl O Connor, appears in Health effects of psychological interventions for worry and rumination: A meta-analysis. The paper is published in Health Psychology.The researchers also noted a correlation between lower levels of worry and rumination, and improved health behaviours.And they found no difference in effect among any sub-groups, suggesting that these techniques are likely to work for most people.Mr McCarrick said:  Our data suggest that there are ways in which we can look after our mental health   by reducing worry and rumination   that can also have lasting consequences for a range of health behaviours, such as sleep hygiene and alcohol dependency. This is particularly pertinent given other studies have recently shown that both worry and rumination can be exacerbated by the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, so the evidence-based psychological techniques highlighted by this research are especially timely.

Now, researchers led by a team from the University of Tsukuba have found new evidence of brain refreshing that takes place during a specific phase of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is when you tend to dream a lot.Previous studies have measured differences in blood flow in the brain between REM sleep, non-REM sleep, and wakefulness using various methods, with conflicting results. In their latest work, the Tsukuba-led team used a technique to directly visualize the movement of red blood cells in the brain capillaries (where nutrients and waste products are exchanged between brain cells and blood) of mice during awake and asleep states. We used a dye to make the brain blood vessels visible under fluorescent light, using a technique known as two-photon microscopy,  says senior author of the study Professor Yu Hayashi.  In this way, we could directly observe the red blood cells in capillaries of the neocortex in non-anesthetized mice. The researchers also measured electrical activity in the brain to identify REM sleep, non-REM sleep, and wakefulness, and looked for differences in blood flow between these phases. We were surprised by the results,  explains Professor Hayashi.  There was a massive flow of red blood cells through the brain capillaries during REM sleep, but no difference between non-REM sleep and the awake state, showing that REM sleep is a unique state The research team then disrupted the mice s sleep, resulting in  rebound  REM sleep a stronger form of REM sleep to compensate for the earlier disruption. Blood flow in the brain was further increased during rebound REM sleep, suggesting an association between blood flow and REM sleep strength. However, when the researchers repeated the same experiments in mice without adenosine A2a receptors (the receptors whose blockade makes you feel more awake after drinking coffee), there was less of an increase in blood flow during REM sleep, even during rebound REM sleep. These results suggest that adenosine A2a receptors may be responsible for at least some of the changes in blood flow in the brain during REM sleep,  says Professor Hayashi.Given that reduced blood flow in the brain and decreased REM sleep are correlated with the development of Alzheimer s disease, which involves the buildup of waste products in the brain, it may be interesting to address whether increased blood flow in the brain capillaries during REM sleep is important for waste removal from the brain. This study lays preliminary groundwork for future investigations into the role of adenosine A2a receptors in this process, which could ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer s disease.

In the study both men and women were exposed to UVB (ultraviolet radiation type B) under controlled conditions, and the findings were unequivocal: increased levels of romantic passion in both genders. The study revealed that exposure to sunlight affects the regulation of the endocrine system responsible for the release of sexual hormones in humans.The study was led by PhD student Roma Parikh and Ashchar Sorek from the laboratory of Prof. Carmit Levy at the Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine. UVB phototherapy was administered to the subjects at the Tel Aviv Sourasky (Ichilov) and Assuta Medical Centers. The groundbreaking discovery was published as a cover story in the prestigious scientific journal Cell Reports.Prof. Levy explains: ""It has been known for many years now that ultraviolet radiation from sunlight increases levels in males, and we also know that sunlight plays a major role in both the behavioral and hormonal regulation of sexuality. However, the mechanism responsible for this regulation remained unknown. Our study enabled a better understanding of this mechanism.""The study began in an animal model, exposing the animals to UVB - sunrays at wavelengths of 320-400 nanometers. The effect was dramatic: females' hormone levels rose significantly, enlarging their ovaries and prolonging their rut season; the attraction between males and females increased; and both were more willing to engage in sexual intercourse.In the second stage, the researchers repeated the experiment in the animal model, this time removing from the skin a protein called p53, which identifies DNA damage and activates pigmentation during exposure to sunlight, as protection against its adverse effects. The removal of p53 eliminated the effect of UVB exposure on the animals' sexual behavior, convincing Prof. Levy and her colleagues that exposure to radiation through the skin was the cause of the observed hormonal, physiological and behavioral changes, and that the protective system is also responsible for the regulation of sexuality.The last stage of the study included 32 human subjects, who filled out validated questionnaires on behaviors of romantic passion and aggression. Treated with UVB phototherapy at the Tel Aviv Sourasky (Ichilov) and Assuta Medical Centers, both genders exhibited a rise in romantic passion, and males also noted an increase in levels of aggression.Similar results were found when the subjects were asked to avoid sunlight for two days, and then tan themselves for approximately 25 minutes. Blood tests revealed that exposure to sunlight resulted in a higher release of hormones like testosterone compared to one day before exposure. A rise in testosterone in males during the summer was also found in analyses of data from the Clalit and Maccabi Health Services.Prof. Levy: ""The skin contains various mechanisms for dealing with radiation from sunlight, and one of these is the p53 protein. We must remember that exposure to UV is dangerous, and can damage the DNA, as in the case of skin cancer. At the same time, two built-in programs in the skin, activated following exposure to sunlight, are in place to protect against DNA damage: the DNA repair system and pigmentation, namely the suntan, based on degree of exposure. By activating both systems, the p53 protein regulates the level of DNA damage. In our study we found that the same system also activates the endocrine system of sexuality and potentially breeding. ""In the future this new discovery from TAU may lead to practical applications, such as UVB treatments for sexual hormone disorders. However, more research is still required before this can be achieved. According to Prof. Levy, the breakthrough will also lead to further discoveries in basic science. ""Our findings open many scientific and philosophical questions. As humans, we have no fur, and our skin is thus directly exposed to sunlight. We are only beginning to understand what this exposure does to us, and the key roles it might play in various physiological and behavioral processes. It's only the tip of the iceberg.""Reference: Parikh R, Sorek E, Parikh S, et al. Skin exposure to UVB light induces a skin-brain-gonad axis and sexual behavior.

While people with genetic deletions in this region have larger heads (macrocephaly) and people with genetic duplications have smaller heads (microcephaly), both variation types affect brain development and function.To study the effects of these variations and search for ways to minimize their impact, University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers are using brain organoids   tiny, 3D cellular models generated in the lab from people with 16p11.2 variations.The organoids, described in a paper publishing August 25, 2021 in Molecular Psychiatry, mimicked the differences in brain size seen in people. They also revealed new information about the molecular mechanisms that malfunction when the 16p11.2 region of the genome is disrupted, providing new opportunities for potential therapeutic intervention. Because our organoids recapitulate the head size of the patients, that tells us this can be a useful model,  said senior author Lilia Iakoucheva, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  And we need better models to study autism spectrum disorder, especially during fetal development. Iakoucheva led the study with Alysson Muotri, PhD, professor of pediatrics and cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine.The brain organoids were created using induced pluripotent stem cells derived from people who have 16p11.2 genomic variations   three people with deletions, three with duplications and three non-variant controls. Researchers obtained a skin sample from each person, gave the skin cells a molecular cocktail that converted them to stem cells, then treated the stem cells in a way that coaxed them into becoming brain cells, preserving each patient s unique genetic background.The organoids revealed that RhoA   a protein that plays a big part in many basic cellular functions, such as development and movement   is more active in both 16p11.2-deleted and 16p11.2-duplicated organoids than it is in organoids without these variations. Over-active RhoA led to a slowdown in neuronal migration, the process by which brain cells get to where they need to be for normal fetal development and function in adulthood.When the team inhibited RhoA in the autism-like organoids, neuronal migration was restored to levels seen in the control organoids. Our work opens the possibility to therapeutically manipulate the RhoA pathway,  said Muotri, who is also director of the UC San Diego Stem Cell Program and a member of the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine.  The same pathway may be also damaged in other individuals with autism spectrum disorder who have macrocephaly or microcephaly. Considering this, we can potentially help millions of patients. Organoids aren t perfect reproductions of the brain. They lack connections to other organ systems, such as blood vessels, and so don t encapsulate full human biology. In addition, therapeutics tested on brain organoids are added directly. They don t need to get across the blood-brain barrier, specialized blood vessels that keep the brain largely free of microbes and toxins.The team plans to further test RhoA inhibitors in a mouse model with 16p11.2 variations or over-active RhoA for their ability to reverse defects associated with autism spectrum disorder.Reference: Urresti J, Zhang P, Moran-Losada P, et al.

Perhaps this is nowhere more evident than in protein evolution, where past and present versions of the same enzyme exist in different species today, with implications for future enzyme design. Now, researchers have used evolutionary  time travel  to learn how an enzyme evolved over time, from one of Earth s most ancient organisms to modern-day humans.The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. If a person lives in present-day Rome, they might want to learn about ancient Rome to better understand who they are,  says Magnus Wolf-Watz, Ph.D., the project s principal investigator.  In the same way, we can look backward in time at more ancient forms of enzymes to understand how the proteins are working today and how we might engineer new versions in the future. Wolf-Watz, who is at Ume  University in Sweden, looked back some 2 to 3 billion years to primitive organisms known as archaea. These single-celled life forms, which still exist today, have characteristics of both prokaryotes (bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus) and eukaryotes (organisms like plants, animals and fungi that have a nucleus in their cells). A branch of archaea known as the Asgard phylum, discovered in 2015, comprises the closest known ancestors to eukaryotic cells. Four types of Asgard archaea have been identified, including Odin archaea, found in hydrothermal vents deep in the Atlantic Ocean.Odin archaea have an enzyme called adenylate kinase (AK), which is also found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Wolf-Watz previously studied two human types of this enzyme, AK1 and AK3. Both are important in maintaining the energy balance in cells, but AK1 is in the cytoplasm, where it transfers a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the main energy carrier in cells) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). In contrast, AK3 resides within mitochondria, where it transfers a phosphate group from guanosine triphosphate (GTP, a molecule similar to ATP but with distinct roles) to AMP.Wolf-Watz s team used X-ray crystallization and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the structures of AK1 and AK3, finding that although the enzymes are very similar, they have a subtle difference in a short loop region that causes AK1 to prefer ATP and AK3 to prefer GTP.  Now we can take any AK enzyme, look at the structure of that loop, and predict whether it s going to use ATP or GTP,  Wolf-Watz says. The next step was to examine a more ancient version of an AK enzyme   from Odin archaea   to learn how AK1 and AK3 evolved to prefer different nucleotide substrates.The researchers purified the archaea AK and determined its structure. They found that the loop important for discriminating ATP and GTP is much longer in the archaeal enzyme, and it has chemical groups that can bind either nucleotide.  What we found is an early ancestor of the human AKs that contains two capacities   it can use both ATP and GTP,  Wolf-Watz says.  During the course of evolution, it became specialized to become specific for one or the other, depending on the cellular compartment where it resides.  The archaea AK can actually use all naturally occurring nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs).  We ve discovered a universal NTP binding motif that could be a building block for the future design of novel enzymes,  Wolf-Watz says.The archaeal AK contains three copies of the enzyme (known as a trimer) that bind to each other through a helical structure. In human AKs, a mutation in this region makes the enzyme copies unable to stick to each other. The human enzymes, which function independently, are almost 1,000-fold more active. The trimer could have been more stable in the extreme environment of hydrothermal vents, but the human enzymes might have traded this thermostability for higher activity, which is important in a cooler environment, Wolf-Watz says.Next, the researchers want to engineer novel enzymes that could be useful in organic synthesis or drug development. They also want to examine other enzymes from Odin archaea and study how they might have evolved over the eons.  We studied one enzyme and made this fantastic discovery,  Wolf-Watz says.  Of course, there s more to find. It s like we re digging through a treasure chest. This article has been republished from the following materials.

Results are therefore regarded as preliminary and should be interpreted as such. Find out about the role of the peer review process in research here. For further information, please contact the cited source.Importantly, however, the significance of these findings in terms of what they can tell us about vaccine protection from exposure to COVID-19 is not currently known, as there is no current agreed clinical cut off to measure COVID-19 vaccination response.Professor Pam Kearns, Director of the University of Birmingham s Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit which is co-ordinating OCTAVE, said:  A significant number of people in the UK were advised to shield because they have conditions or long term illnesses which place them at greater risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. The rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 has been a major step forward in the battle against this global pandemic, and the most clinically-at-risk people were among the first in the UK to be offered one. However, while we know COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in healthy individuals, questions have remained as to how effective they are in protecting the chronically ill. These preliminary results of OCTAVE and the results of our continuing and forthcoming research will be instrumental in helping inform how best to vaccinate patients with chronic conditions and protect them from COVID-19 infection in the future. Professor Iain McInnes, lead of the OCTAVE trial, and Vice Principal and Head of the College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences at the University of Glasgow, said:  The roll-out of the vaccine programme was extremely important for these vulnerable groups of patients, however due to their underlying medical conditions and treatments, which can weaken their immune systems, we were concerned that people with these medical conditions may not receive optimal protection, so it was, and remains, extremely important to investigate this unanswered question. While 40% of these clinically at-risk patent groups were found to have a low or undetectable immune response after a double dose of the vaccine, we are encouraged that this figure isn t higher. However, it is possible even partial protection may be clinically beneficial, and this is something we will closely monitor. There are also imminent plans in place to investigate the effects of administrating an alternate vaccine dose to the group with an undetectable or low vaccine immune response; and we hope these findings will support the role out of an immunological screening programme for vulnerable patients to identify those who will benefit from a subsequent vaccine boost. We would continue to encourage all people and especially those patients within these clinically at-risk groups to make sure they receive their vaccine doses if they haven t done so already. Dr Rob Buckle, Chief Scientist of the Medical Research Council, part of UKRI, which co-funded the trial, said:  Today s results will be of concern for the subset of people within those who are immunosuppressed for whom the vaccine didn t trigger a large protective response. We re funding an extension to the OCTAVE study to give third jabs to this group, which we hope will deliver a much-needed immunity boost, or identify those who could benefit from other interventions. One of the real strengths of the UK s scientific response to the pandemic has been the way that we ve assembled teams of experts to lead cutting-edge and responsive studies like this, to inform our vaccine roll-out and government decision-making in real time. The OCTAVE (Observational Cohort Trial-T-cells Antibodies and Vaccine Efficacy in SARS-CoV-2) study looks at those with immune mediated inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ANCA-Associated Vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as hepatic disease and renal failure. So far more than 2,500 patients have been recruited to the trial making it one of the largest global studies in which detailed immune response is being assessed post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.Reference: Kearns P, Siebert S, Willicombe M, et al. 2021.

The predator insects that feed on these bugs emit odors that pests can sense, which changes the pests  behavior and even their physiology to avoid being eaten. With bugs becoming more resistant to traditional pesticides, researchers now report they have developed a way to bottle the  smell of fear  produced by predators to repel and disrupt destructive insects naturally without the need for harsh substances. The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. It is not uncommon to use our senses to avoid risky situations. If a building was on fire, we as humans could use our senses of sight or smell to detect the threat,  says Sara Hermann, Ph.D., the project s principal investigator.  There is evidence for such behavioral responses to risk across taxa that suggest prey organisms can detect predation threats, but the mechanisms for detection aren t very well understood, especially with insects. Insects rely on olfactory cues to find food, mates and places to live, so this is a great opportunity to investigate how to use these smells to manipulate their behavior,  says Jessica Kansman, Ph.D., a postdoc who is presenting the work at the meeting. Hermann and Kansman are at the Pennsylvania State University.Aphids are a highly destructive pest to an array of crops, and their large numbers, ability to transmit plant pathogens and increased resistance to insecticides make them a persistent problem for growers. They also happen to be a favorite food of the ladybug, which gardeners welcome as a source of sustainable pest management. Hermann s research has shown that aphids and other herbivorous insects will steer clear of fields and gardens if they can smell predators nearby. Not only that, but exposure to the odor cues given off by ladybugs can also cause aphids to slow their reproduction rates and increase their ability to grow wings, both of which are behaviors designed to avoid threats.With these observations in mind, the research team set out to determine whether the olfactory cues given off by ladybugs could, by themselves, control pests. They started by identifying and extracting the volatile odor profile from live ladybugs using gas chromatography   mass spectrometry, which separates and allows for identification of the individual components of the ladybugs  smell. To see which compounds the aphids would respond to, they hooked up the antennae of live aphids to an electroantennogram (EAG) machine and exposed them to each individual odor the predator emitted to see which compounds they detected. The strength of their reactions was measured based on the signal picked up by the EAG machine. Of the many compounds emitted by ladybugs, aphids had the strongest response to methoxypyrazines, such as isopropyl methoxypyrazine, isobutyl methoxypyrazine and sec-butyl methoxypyrazine. Once the compounds were identified, Hermann and team set out to create a special odor blend that can be used in an essential oil diffuser that will spread the scent over time across a garden or field.Next, the team plans to conduct field tests of their scent diffusers to see if the effects on aphids and ladybugs are similar to what they observed in the lab. Hermann and Kansman also want to determine the dispersal area of the diffusers, and whether they could be applied to other pests and predators, as well as various types of crops. In addition, they are collaborating with a manufacturing company to design special diffusers for eventual commercial use by both farmers and gardeners.This article has been republished from the following materials.

A promising new study in canines from Northwestern Medicine, Texas A&M University and ImmunoGenesis is giving scientists some hope. The team of researchers discovered a treatment for canine glioblastoma   the second-most common type of brain cancer in dogs   that reduced the volume of some dogs  tumors. The findings have promising implications for the human version of the aggressive brain cancer.In a Phase I clinical trial conducted at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, investigators injected an immunotherapy drug known as a STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) agonist directly into the glioblastoma of five dogs.STING agonists can induce immunological responses that allow the immune system to fight otherwise immunologically resistant cancer cells. MRI scans taken of the canines over the course of the trial revealed that some of the dogs, even with a single dose, responded to the treatment with apparent reductions in their tumor volume, including one complete radiographic response, meaning the tumor completely disappeared. The findings lead the team to conclude this therapy can trigger a robust, innate anti-tumor immune response and may be highly effective on recalcitrant tumors such as glioblastoma in humans. The study was published Aug. 25 in Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.The immunotherapy drug was developed by Dr. Michael A. Curran, an immunologist and founder of ImmunoGenesis, and is based on ongoing research that included Dr. Amy B. Heimberger, scientific director of the Malnati Brain Institute at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.Decisions about whether to advance a therapeutic candidate to human clinical trials is typically based on mouse data, Heimberger said. However, these tumors in mice are tiny and there are additional discrepancies in the genetics and immune background between mouse and man brain tumors.  This is likely one of several reasons why promising preclinical data may not have the same impact during clinical trials,  Heimberger said.  Because canine glioblastoma shares very close similarities to the human counterpoint, we tested this novel immune therapeutic to help us make a go/no-go decision for human clinical trials.  Both canine and human gliomas tend to have a poor prognosis, as they are difficult to surgically remove, and traditional therapies come with multiple side effects and are expensive. Even after a surgery to remove the tumor and radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, humans with glioblastoma may only survive a few more months.Because of the simple delivery of the STING agonist and the marked volume reduction of the tumor, the researchers believe this strategy may provide a viable adjunct therapeutic approach for human glioma.The trial was conducted at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital by Dr. Beth Boudreau, an assistant professor of neurology.  With this therapy, we were trying to take tumors that do not, on their own, generate a lot of immune response and turn them into tumors that do by injecting them with this immunotherapy agent,  Boudreau said.  In the canine clinical trial, the maximum tolerated dose was limited by the large unresected masses.  Heimberger indicated that in human subjects, the standard of care is surgical resection before starting any therapy, and therefore higher doses of the STING agonist in human subjects would likely be needed.  This clinical trial was based on earlier research by the team including Dr. Jonathan Levine, a neurology professor and head of the CVMBS Small Animal Clinical Sciences Department which analyzed a massive canine genomic dataset collected from multiple glioma samples. They found that canine and human gliomas are molecularly similar, suggesting that the two diseases have a similar mutational, cancer-causing process that would enable similar treatment strategies. In the next phase of the project, Heimberger and Curran are exploring using a similar approach in clinical trials of human glioma patients who have undergone a surgical debulking.Reference: Boudreau CE, Najem H, Ott M, et al.

In addition, bicarbonate can reenter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide later, contributing to climate change. Now, researchers have developed tiny  nanojars,  much smaller than the width of a human hair, that split bicarbonate into carbonate and capture it, as well as certain toxic anions, so the ions can be removed and potentially recycled.The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  We originally developed nanojars to extract harmful negatively charged ions, like chromate and arsenate, from water,  says Gellert Mezei, Ph.D., who is presenting the work at the meeting.  But it turns out that they also bind strongly to carbonate.  Carbonate or other ions captured in the nanojars could later be disposed of or recycled into useful products, he says. Nanojars are tiny containers made up of multiple repeating units of a copper ion, a pyrazole group and a hydroxide. The jars only form when an ion with a  2 charge, such as chromate, arsenate, phosphate or carbonate, is present. When the proper ingredients are added to an organic solvent, the repeating units form and assemble into nanojars, with the  2 charged anion bound tightly at the center. To remove anions from water, the researchers added the solvent containing the nanojar components, which formed an organic layer on top of the water.  The solvent doesn t mix with the water, but the anions from the water can enter this organic layer,  explains Mezei, who is at Western Michigan University.  Then, the nanojars form and wrap around the ions, trapping them in the organic phase.  Because the water and organic layers don t mix, they can easily be separated. Treating the organic layer with a weak acid causes the nanojars to fall apart, releasing the anions for disposal or recycling. The researchers have used nanojars to remove toxic anions from water.  We ve shown that we can extract chromate and arsenate to below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-permitted levels for drinking water   really, really low levels,  Mezei says. The nanojars have an even higher affinity for carbonate, and adding a molecule called 1,10-phenanthroline to the mixture produces nanojars that bind two carbonate ions each instead of one. The team has also made nanojars that are selective for certain anions.  The original pyrazole building block makes nanojars that are totally selective for  2 charged ions, but they can t discriminate among these ions,  Mezei says. By using two pyrazoles tethered by an ethylene linker as a building block, the researchers made nanojars that bind preferentially to carbonate. More recently, they ve shown that using two pyrazoles with a propylene linker produces sulfate-selective nanojars. These anion-selective nanojars will be important for applications in which only certain  2 charged ions should be removed. The researchers have also been working on making the process more suitable for real-world applications. For example, they ve swapped a weak base, trioctylamine, for the strong base, sodium hydroxide, originally used to make nanojars.  Trioctylamine, unlike sodium hydroxide, is soluble in the organic phase and makes the formation of the nanojars much more efficient,  Mezei says. Interestingly, trioctylamine causes nanojars to form with slightly different structures, which he refers to as  capped  nanojars, but they appear to bind carbonate just as tightly. So far, all of the experiments have been conducted at the laboratory scale. Developing a system to treat large volumes of water, such as in a lake, will require collaboration with engineers, Mezei says. However, he envisions that contaminated lake water could be pumped into a station for treatment and then returned to the lake. Some ions, such as phosphate, could be recycled for useful purposes, such as fertilizer. Carbonate might be recycled to make  green  solvents, called carbonate esters, for the nanojar extraction itself.  Whether this process for removing carbon dioxide from water   and indirectly, the atmosphere   would be competitive with other technologies, that I don t know yet,  Mezei says.  There are many aspects that have to be taken into account, and that s a tricky business. ReferencePresented at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society, Aug. 22-26 2021.

Nonetheless, new technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart agriculture, bioengineering, synthetic biology and 3D printers are also being used to decentralize and personalize food manufacturing,  he said.  They have the potential to democratize ownership and mobilize alternative economic organizations devoted to open-source licensing, member-owned cooperatives, social financing and platform business models. Although cellular meat is not yet widely available to consumers, its proponents believe that cellular agriculture could reduce land, water and chemical inputs, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, improve food safety, optimize nutrition, and eliminate the need to raise and slaughter large numbers of animals for food. However, cellular agriculture could also concentrate ownership and power in the global food system, namely by displacing ranchers, farmers, fishermen and ancillary industries.The latter possibility has led to widespread concern that cellular agriculture could accelerate the concentration of wealth and diminish public participation in agriculture   all while offering fewer environmental and nutritional benefits than promised.Over the past decade, scholars have explored a broad spectrum of socioeconomic and ethical questions pertaining to this technological approach, noted Chiles, who is a research associate at Penn State s Rock Ethics Institute. However, he explained, this scholarship has done little to explore the types of mechanisms that might facilitate a more just and equitable development of this sector.To assess cellular agriculture s potential trajectories, Chiles and colleagues attended 11 cellular agriculture and alternative economic organization events held around the United States over two years, interviewing key experts at those conferences and summits, asking how they think the industry will develop and should develop. Likewise, the researchers collected data from an additional 21 conferences online.The study s findings, published today (Aug. 24) in Agriculture and Human Values, affirm the argument for increased public investments in open-source research and education on cellular agriculture, particularly for community and household-level production. The paper is publicly available through open access. The jury is still out on how cellular agriculture will develop in the U.S. and around the world, Chiles pointed out. This research   which engaged innovators and early adopters in the field in conversation about whether this emerging technology will further concentrate wealth and power in the global food system   yielded valuable clues, he said. Government investments in publicly accessible digital infrastructures could help to facilitate a more just transition, as could public policies that protect workers  rights and consumer privacy,  Chiles added.  Stakeholders who are concerned about the justice and equity implications of cellular agriculture may ultimately find more success by engaging with how these technologies are being developed rather than avoiding them or trying to eradicate them.

Breathing in enough of the wrong ones can cause serious and potentially long-term health problems. However, it can be hard to estimate exposure because current devices are limited in what they can detect. Today, researchers report development of a new personal air-sampling system that can detect an unprecedented range of these compounds from a special badge or pen attached to someone s shirt or placed in a pocket.The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  In every situation there s a unique set of compounds that could be present in the air, including potential hazards that we do not know about,  says Allen Apblett, Ph.D., the project s senior researcher, who is presenting the research.  Using a single material, we can capture many classes of these compounds, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and potentially offer a much more comprehensive picture of exposures."" The U.S. military is eager to better understand the health threats its personnel face and has provided considerable funding for the project. However, the new sampler could also be used in many workplaces and at home, says Apblett, who is a professor at Oklahoma State University and co-founder of Airotect, the company developing the sampler. VOCs are a major source of air pollution. The compounds originate from numerous household products, as well as from fuels such as gasoline and from industrial processes. Depending on which VOCs someone encounters and their level of exposure, problems ranging from nasal irritation to cancer can result. Because someone s exposures can vary as they move about, researchers have sought to design simple, lightweight detectors that can travel with the person and don t need electricity. Badges containing substances that absorb gases are already in use in some workplaces, but these materials have a shortcoming: They latch onto certain varieties of VOCs better than others. If a worker is concerned about, for example, the VOCs formaldehyde, benzene and naphthalene in one location, they would likely need two or more types of these devices to test for them, Apblett says.  We circumvent that with a material that can absorb the broadest spectrum of volatile organic compounds.  That new material is a silica with nanoscale pores contained within a roughly credit-card-sized badge that attaches to clothes. Airotect s team is also experimenting with other configurations to hold the silica, such as one that resembles a pen that could rest within a pocket or a fabric badge that could be sewn on. The silica, known as OSU-6 and developed by a graduate student in Apblett s lab, binds VOCs in its tiny pores through normally weak electrical attractions, known as van der Waals forces. The tight curvature of OSU-6 s nanopores significantly enhances these forces, making it possible to bind VOCs much more strongly than the industry standard. Because these bonds are physical, not chemical, in nature, they allow the material to latch onto a wide range of compounds. When in use, the badge is opened to expose three OSU-6-filled tubes to the air. The length of time it s worn depends largely on the potential exposures. Afterward, the badge is sent to a lab where the VOC-laden material is warmed to release the compounds so the researchers can identify and quantify them. Apblett and his colleagues at Airotect have so far tested the material s ability to detect well over 100 compounds in lab-based experiments. They have also found that OSU-6 stabilizes unstable or reactive compounds, making it more feasible to analyze traditionally difficult-to-monitor reactive compounds. The team has begun testing the sampler s ability to pick up pollutants common in workplaces such as commercial-scale manufacturing operations and agricultural production facilities. They have also begun using it in real-world military scenarios, including military deployments and a student s dormitory room. Once launched, the air sampler will be available to industry and the public, with the cost for device and the lab analysis starting at $75.

The study warns that many decades of experimental work have left us with a skewed understanding of the effects of nitrogen pollution, and this could hamper responses to global change. Professor Dan Bebber, from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute, writing in the journal Science of the Total Environment, says scientific experiments have been  unrealistic . They often involve simulations of nitrogen deposition far higher than those experienced even in heavily polluted regions, in fact they are similar to mineral fertilizer applications in agriculture. Professor Bebber said:  Despite decades of research, past experiments can tell us little about how the biosphere has responded to anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. A new approach is required to improve our understanding of this important phenomenon.  In most experiments scientists have used more than 100 kg N ha-1 y-1 to model the impact of nitrogen, while global average land surface deposition rates are around 1 kg N ha-1 y-1 and only exceed 10 kg N ha-1 y-1 in certain regions, primarily in industrialized areas of Europe and Asia and particularly in forests. Many species are highly sensitive to nitrogen, and react very differently to these lower levels than to unrealistic experimental levels. In his analysis, Professor Bebber calls for future experiments to be designed to take into account how much nitrogen pollution is found in different ecosystems and regions, and for researchers to monitor the impact of nitrogen pollution for longer periods to detect cumulative effects. Research should also examine the relationship between the concentration of nitrogen released and the environmental response. Professor Bebber said:  Understanding the impacts of anthropogenic nitrogen has been a major goal of global change research, through observational and experimental studies. However, there remains a wide gulf between global nitrogen deposition rates, and the experimental treatments applied to simulate them.  Where the purpose of an experiment is to understand the effects of agricultural fertilizers, then high levels of N application rates are justified. Researchers employing more realistic nitrogen treatments have questioned the validity of rates far exceeding current or predicted N deposition levels. The responses of organisms and ecosystems to enhanced N availability can be subtle and non-linear. ReferenceBebber DP. The gap between atmospheric nitrogen deposition experiments and reality.

Every patient receiving fluvoxamine during the trial is tracked for 28 days to determine their health outcomes and if they still need hospital treatment. Researchers found about a 30-per-cent reduction in events among those receiving fluvoxamine compared to those who did not.   The fluvoxamine trial formed part of the larger TOGETHER Trial that started in May 2020, aiming to test potential COVID-19 treatments in a community setting. TOGETHER Trial scientists tested eight drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, metformin, kaletra and ivermectin, but only fluvoxamine had a positive effect on COVID-19.   Fluvoxamine is the only treatment that, if administered early, can prevent COVID-19 from becoming a life-threatening illness,  said Mills, co-principal investigator for the TOGETHER Trial and a professor of McMaster s Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact.  It could be one of our most powerful weapons against the virus and its effectiveness is one of the most important discoveries we have made since the pandemic began. In addition, this cheap, easily-accessible pill is a massive boon to public health, both in Canada and internationally, allowing hospitals to avoid expensive and sometimes risky treatments.  Costing about $4 per 10-day course, fluvoxamine could be a game-changer for poorer countries with low vaccination rates and lacking access to more advanced COVID-19 therapies, Mills said. Fluvoxamine has been used since the 1990s and its safety profile is well-known.

It is characterized by endometrial-like cells   tissue that is similar to the tissue lining the uterus   existing outside of the uterus. These cells induce inflammatory reactions, which can cause scarring, pain and fertility issues. The aetiology of endometriosis is not yet fully understood, and subsequently it is challenging to diagnose. On average, a woman waits eight years from the onset of symptoms to receiving a clinical diagnosis. While a number of screening tools and diagnostic approaches have been tested, they are not validated to predict an individual's risk of developing endometriosis.The complex pathophysiology of endometriosis also makes its treatment challenging. Currently available therapeutic options are purely symptomatic, as no cure exists for the disease. Consequently, living with endometriosis can have a negative effect on an individual's physical and mental health and ultimately their quality of life; it is an area of women's health that has a great unmet need.Krina Zondervan is professor of Reproductive & Genomic Epidemiology and head of the Nuffield Department of Women s & Reproductive Health. In addition, she is also the co-director of the Oxford Endometriosis CaRe Centre. Zondervan's research group combines genomic, molecular and environmental epidemiological research methods to further our understanding of women's health disorders. The team focus particularly on endometriosis, and Zondervan co-founded the International Endometriosis Genome Consortium (IEGC) that has conducted some the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the disease to date.Genetic analyses in individuals and families with endometriosis have revealed novel insights into the heritable nature of the disease, which is now estimated at 50%. The identification of specific gene variants associated with endometriosis provides novel opportunities for the development of biomarkers and targeted treatments.In a new body of work, published in Science Translational Medicine, Zondervan and a collaboration of colleagues sequenced DNA samples from 32 families in which at least three women had been diagnosed with endometriosis. They identified that individuals with a more severe form of the disease possessed variants in a gene known as NPSR1, a finding that was also present in a GWAS of 849 non-human primates with endometriosis. In mouse models of the disease, an inhibitor of the NPSR1 protein   known as SHA 68   reduced pain and inflammation. The authors suggest that the NPSR1 system may be a potential non-hormonal target for treating endometriosis.Technology Networks had the pleasure of speaking with Zondervan and Dr. Thomas Tapmeier, a senior research fellow at Monash University and visiting fellow in the Nuffield Department of Women s and Reproductive Health, and corresponding author of the paper, to learn more about how the research was conducted and the clinical relevance of the findings. Q: For our readers that may be unfamiliar, can you explain what spontaneous endometriosis is?A: We use the term ""spontaneous endometriosis"" only in the context of endometriosis in animals. All endometriosis in women is ""spontaneous"", i.e., it arises without anyone actively trying to induce it. The endometriosis we observed and studied in the rhesus macaque, a non-human primate, is also spontaneous. In contrast, there are mouse models for endometriosis where endometrium is transplanted into the mouse, and this creates a model of endometriosis to study.Q: What inspired the researchers to adopt a genetic sequencing approach to explore the root cause of endometriosis?A: The work started with the long-standing observation that endometriosis can be ""heritable"", i.e., can run in families. Back in 2007 we published work using DNA from families with at least 3 women diagnosed with endometriosis, a so-called ""genetic linkage"" study and showed that an area on chromosome 7 was more often shared between affected women than expected by the laws of inheritance alone. This focused our interest on this area as it could harbor genes and variants implicated in familial endometriosis. However, the area contained many genes. In this study we narrowed down the area further and then successfully used next generation genome sequencing to identify genetic variants that were over-represented in familial cases (mostly stage III/IV disease) vs. controls, in the gene NPSR1.Q: Why did the study explore genes in both humans and non-human primate models?A: We have a long-standing collaboration to study endometriosis in the rhesus macaque with Professor Joseph Kemnitz at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Professor Jeffrey Rogers of the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. Through genealogical information, we had access to a large, complex pedigree of 850+ animals containing many female animals with endometriosis. Rhesus macaques menstruate just like women do, and they can show similar symptoms associated with endometriosis, such as infertility and period pain. We used DNA from the animals in the pedigree to conduct a similar linkage analysis as we had done for human families, which   unexpectedly   replicated the signal we saw on human chromosome seven. This was extremely exciting and led our joint teams to further study both humans and rhesus macaques.Q: How representative was the human sample?A: The sequencing study focused on familial endometriosis, i.e., women diagnosed with endometriosis in families with three or more endometriosis cases. This led us to identify three relatively rare (frequency of around two percent in the general population) ""coding"" DNA variants that directly impact how the NPSR1 protein is produced. Families participating in this study came from all over the world, although most came from the UK and USA. We also observed an association with a more common variant in NPSR1 (frequency around 10%) using DNA from women unselected for a family history of endometriosis. Most women in this analysis came from the UK and Australia. Worth noting is the results were seen predominantly for women with stage III/IV disease. This is consistent with our previous observations that stage III/IV disease (characterized by more extensive disease typically involving the ovaries and wide-spread adhesions) is more ""genetically driven"" than stage I/II (characterized typically by superficial disease in the abdominal cavity without widespread adhesions).Q: You identified a gene that is linked to endometriosis. Can you tell us more about this gene and its function?A: The gene, NPSR1, encodes the protein Neuropeptide S receptor 1. NPSR1 is a membrane protein that bind NPS (Neuropeptide S), named after its role as a neurotransmitter in the brain   S, because its amino acid sequence starts with a serine. Variants in this gene have previously been associated with other inflammatory conditions such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, but also with psychological traits such as anxiety, panic and sleep disorders. We showed that NPSR1 is expressed in epithelial cells within the endometrium, and also on certain white blood cells (monocytes) in peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal fluid is present in the abdominal cavity of all women, and in women with endometriosis commonly contains cells that play a role in the inflammatory response characteristic of endometriosis. As indicated above, NPSR1 is expressed at high levels in certain brain regions, raising the possibility that, in addition to involvement in inflammatory response, it could be involved in pain processing in relation to endometriosis. We do not currently have a good understanding of the functional mechanistic link between NPSR1 (variants) and endometriosis, and this needs to be further explored in specific cellular and tissue-based assays.Q: You identified an inhibitor of the receptor, known as SHA 68R, which reduced inflammation and abdominal pain in a mouse model. What research exists for this protein, and has it been used in any existing therapeutic strategies/ explored in other research?A: The inhibitor we used is what is termed a ""tool compound"", i.e., a molecule known to inhibit the function of a target (in this case, the NPSR1 receptor). We used SHA 68R purely to show the effect of NPSR1 inhibition, but the compound itself is unlikely to be therapeutically applicable. The next step is to start designing more specific compounds similar to SHA 68R that are clinically active and applicable. (R designates the R-enantiomer of the racematic compound, which is the active ingredient.)Q: Are there any limitations to this work you wish to highlight?A: I think this work presents a very exciting new avenue for the development of non-hormonal therapeutics in endometriosis, targeting the inflammation that is characteristic of endometriosis. Inevitably, questions remain, such as described above: we need to better understand the mechanistic link between genetic variation in NPSR1 and tissue-specific function of the receptor and the protein it binds (NPS), and we need to work on therapeutics that target this pathway in a specific and targeted manner with minimal side effects.Krina Zondervan and Thomas Tapmeier were speaking to Molly Campbell, Science Writer for Technology Networks.

Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science s Department of Mechanical Engineering. Co-principal investigator will be Assistant Professor Weiying Dai from Watson s Department of Computer Science, with Harvard Associate Professor Ali Gholipour as a research partner.Razavi first became interested in brain research in 2014, when earning his PhD at the University of Georgia. His advisor was working on molecular dynamics modeling to predict the physical movements of atoms and molecules, but wanted to branch out by studying the mechanical modeling of soft tissue. One of the important topics with soft biological tissue is the brain,  Razavi said.  It s a mystery for us how our brains start from the smoothest state at 22 to 25 weeks after gestation, but within a few weeks there is expansion in the surface area and volume as well as brain folding. When he arrived at Binghamton in 2018, Razavi focused on the mechanics of human skin, doing research with Associate Professor Guy German from Watson College s Department of Biomedical Engineering.With this NSF project, he hopes to chart the formation of brain folds as faster-growing grey matter (the outer layer where higher-level thinking is done) grows on top of white matter (the inner layer that communicates between different gray matter areas and between the gray matter and the rest of the body).There are about 100 billion neurons in a human brain, and information is transmitted through a complex network of axonal fibers that would stretch the entire 239,000 miles from the Earth to the Moon if connected end to end. Hardwiring for most of this network happens before birth, as growing brains form folds that connect the neurons in random yet significant ways. We don t understand the underlying mechanism from the biological view, but we can say from the mechanical view that we have folds because we have mismatch in the growth rate of the layers,  Razavi said.  This is not just about the brain. If we have a multilayer system and the outer layer grows faster than the inner layers, then we will have instability and folding. Gholipour   Harvard Medical School s director of translational radiology research   took scans of 50 fetuses at 25 weeks and 36 weeks using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as brain-specific diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which maps the diffusion process of molecules within cells. Professor Gholipour and his team have the most precise MRI and DTI for the fetal brain,  Razavi said.  It is really difficult to get those images because the nature of pregnancy means fetuses are in motion. After birth, people can be put into a static condition. Dai, who conducts her own brain-related research, will offer her expertise to parse through those results, he added:  We should find a mutual language between the imaging of the fetal brain and the mechanical model. She will help us to process those data to create our mechanical models. How those 50 fetal brains grew and folded then will be compared to Razavi s computer model to see whether the expected patterns match the actual ones. If we are precise, the results should be close to each other,  he said.  Otherwise, we will say:  What s the problem? What kind of other factors haven t we included in our models?  We have included a lot of data, but we don t know what will happen. Razavi sees this study as a beginning step to understanding some brain disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and polymicrogyria (in which the surface of the brain has many ridges or folds). From there, he potentially sees a lifetime of possible brain-related research avenues that could branch out. I think we will need a very long time to decipher the mystery of the brain, because it s not comparable with the other organs at all. It s completely different and very complex,  he said.This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

For the first time, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh have shown that animals also exhibit this strange tendency.We ve seen it play out in the sports world time and time again: a single action from a single player can make or break the outcome of the game. For decades, this idea of being unable to perform when it matters most, or choking under pressure, has earned notorious status among top athletes and others. New research from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh shows for the first time that this propensity is not unique to humans.As part of the behavioral study recently published in PNAS, three Rhesus monkeys were trained to perform a challenging reaching task. Occasionally, a jackpot reward was offered, and when it was, performance declined, with up to 25% more failures. Subjects were also offered a drop of juice as a payoff. A closer analysis of reaching kinematics indicated that subjects decreased their performance, or choked, under pressure in part because they reached too cautiously on jackpot trials. How can there be massive changes in neural activity and really minimal changes in kinematics? We re wrestling with how this is possible.  Once the right parameters were dialed in and behavior stabilized, I was impressed by how robust the effect was,  explains Adam Smoulder, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon and co-first author of the paper.  It didn t seem to matter when that jackpot trial occurred; subjects  performance ebbed and flowed according to the size of the potential payoff. Investigating the neural underpinnings of these findings is where the group is headed next.  In the recordings we captured from the subjects  cerebral cortex, we re seeing large changes in activity that come about as the reward changes,  explains Steve Chase, professor of biomedical engineeringOpens in new window at Carnegie Mellon and the Neuroscience InstituteOpens in new window.  This is fascinating, because the changes in the movement that differentiate between success and failure are really subtle. Now, we re wrestling with how is that possible? How can there be massive changes in neural activity and really minimal changes in kinematics? The group s research also demonstrates an important connection between sensory motor processing and emotional processing, historically believed to be unrelated systems. Our work opens the door for further exploration into the neuroscience of this phenomenon,  says Aaron Batista, professor of bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh.  The fact that nonhuman animals also choke under pressure suggests that this behavioral quirk is something our biological systems are just wired to do. We shouldn t be beating ourselves up over it or blaming professional athletes because they choke under pressure. It s just something all brains do.

Step time variability decreases, reaction time shortens, and executive control of gait is enhanced.These were the main findings of a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled crossover study of 20 volunteers by researchers at S o Paulo State University s Institute of Biosciences (IB-UNESP) in Rio Claro, Brazil. An article reporting the study is published in Neurorehabilitation & Neural Repair.The participants attended two 30-minute sessions of aerobic exercise (cycling at moderate intensity) one week apart, combined with different tDCS conditions, active or  sham  (placebo).Cognitive functions and pre-frontal cortex activity while walking were assessed before and immediately after each session. Spatiotemporal parameters were also included in the analysis to assess gait variability, step length, and processing speed. Compared with the pre-assessment, participants decreased step time variability, shortened simple and choice reaction times, and increased pre-frontal cortex activity in the stimulated hemisphere while walking only after aerobic exercise and active tDCS,  the article concludes. The authors were supported by FAPESP.According to Rodrigo Vit rio, a professor at IB-UNESP and last author of the article, an unbiased comparison was assured by administering active interventions and a placebo or sham treatment on separate days. Half the participants were given 20 minutes of actual tDCS followed by simulated tDCS for 10 seconds. The other half underwent the procedures in reverse order (sham followed by genuine treatment).In tDCS, two small rectangular electrodes are attached to specific places on the head. The appliance is portable and battery-powered. The current is very weak (2 milliamperes) but sufficient to pass through the scalp and stimulate neurons in the region of interest. Despite the limitations of such a small sample size, we found that transcranial stimulation activated the pre-frontal cortex, a brain region that Parkinson s patients use more to control gait than healthy individuals. A single session associated with exercise enhanced cognitive function and produced other improvements,  said Vit rio, currently a Research Fellow at Northumbria University s Faculty of Health and Life Sciences in the United Kingdom.In an interview given to Ag ncia FAPESP, Vit rio explained that one of the aims of the study was to explore the effects of tDCS in greater depth than previous studies by groups of which he was a member, which had already shown that aerobic exercise improves motor activity in Parkinson s patients.  Transcranial stimulation is safe and has been found promising to potentiate the effect of interventions and treatments. It s often prescribed for depression, for example,  he said.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 1% of the world population over 65 had Parkinson s in 2019.

Research has also shown that SARS-CoV-2 variants that lose the furin cleavage site at the spike protein (S gene mutants) emerge rapidly during propagation in Vero cells (lineage of cells used in cell cultures).  Now, new research published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, shows that hamsters inoculated with S gene mutants show resistance to subsequent infection with both the parental strain and the currently emerging SARS-CoV-2 alpha and gamma variants (B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the U.K. and P.1. variant, first identified in Brazil, respectively). The research highlights the potential benefits of S gene mutants as immunogens (antigens that can trigger an immune response). SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants may be used as immunogens for live-attenuated vaccines, similar to the current yellow fever vaccine,  said Hirofumi Sawa, Ph.D., M.D., study principal investigator in the Division of Molecular Pathobiology, International Institute for Zoonosis Control, at Hokkaido University, in Sapporo Japan, and with One Health Research Center at Hokkaido University.   In the new study, researchers set out to further characterize SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants properties through animal experiments using hamsters. All infected animals were maintained in isolators at the biosafety level-3 facility.  Our experiments were conducted in accordance with set guidelines. Because we had to move animals with the isolators into the safety cabinet to monitor the animals, we did a lot of heavy lifting on a daily basis,  said lead study author Michihito Sasaki, Ph.D., D.V.M., a lecturer in the Division of Molecular Pathobiology, International Institute for Zoonosis Control, at Hokkaido University. The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants are weakened variants but can induce protective immunity against infection with clinical strains of SARS-CoV-2.  Because these variants rapidly emerge through SARS-CoV-2 propagation in some cell lines, including Vero cells, researchers should be alert to the possibility of unexpected contamination with these variants,  said Dr. Sasaki.  The researchers say their next steps are to uncover the mechanism of severe COVID-19 and develop new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.  To overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, a multisectoral and transdisciplinary approach under the  One Health  umbrella is needed,  said Dr. Sawa.  At our International Institute for Zoonosis Control, we endeavor to establish effective strategies for prediction, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases, including COVID-19.

The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as Comirnaty (koe-mir -na-tee), for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older. The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for individuals 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. The FDA s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. While this and other vaccines have met the FDA s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,  said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D.  While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated. Today s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S.  Since Dec. 11, 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has been available under EUA in individuals 16 years of age and older, and the authorization was expanded to include those 12 through 15 years of age on May 10, 2021. EUAs can be used by the FDA during public health emergencies to provide access to medical products that may be effective in preventing, diagnosing, or treating a disease, provided that the FDA determines that the known and potential benefits of a product, when used to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.FDA-approved vaccines undergo the agency s standard process for reviewing the quality, safety and effectiveness of medical products. For all vaccines, the FDA evaluates data and information included in the manufacturer s submission of a biologics license application (BLA). A BLA is a comprehensive document that is submitted to the agency providing very specific requirements. For Comirnaty, the BLA builds on the extensive data and information previously submitted that supported the EUA, such as preclinical and clinical data and information, as well as details of the manufacturing process, vaccine testing results to ensure vaccine quality, and inspections of the sites where the vaccine is made. The agency conducts its own analyses of the information in the BLA to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective and meets the FDA s standards for approval. Comirnaty contains messenger RNA (mRNA), a kind of genetic material. The mRNA is used by the body to make a mimic of one of the proteins in the virus that causes COVID-19. The result of a person receiving this vaccine is that their immune system will ultimately react defensively to the virus that causes COVID-19. The mRNA in Comirnaty is only present in the body for a short time and is not incorporated into - nor does it alter - an individual s genetic material. Comirnaty has the same formulation as the EUA vaccine and is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart.  Our scientific and medical experts conducted an incredibly thorough and thoughtful evaluation of this vaccine. We evaluated scientific data and information included in hundreds of thousands of pages, conducted our own analyses of Comirnaty s safety and effectiveness, and performed a detailed assessment of the manufacturing processes, including inspections of the manufacturing facilities,  said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  We have not lost sight that the COVID-19 public health crisis continues in the U.S. and that the public is counting on safe and effective vaccines.

Before Germany could succeed, Allied forces disrupted the program and confiscated some of the cubes of uranium at the heart of it. The ultimate fate of most of that uranium is unknown, but a few cubes thought to be associated with the program are in the U.S. and Europe. Today, scientists report initial results from new methods being developed to confirm their provenance. The techniques might also help with investigations into illicit trafficking of nuclear material.The researchers will present their results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. One cube is at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), but no one is sure how it got there, says Jon Schwantes, Ph.D., the project s principal investigator. Through collaborators, including Timothy Koeth, Ph.D., at the University of Maryland, the lab also has access to a few other cubes.  We don t know for a fact that the cubes are from the German program, so first we want to establish that,  Schwantes says.  Then we want to compare the different cubes to see if we can classify them according to the particular research group that created them.  In the early 1940s, several German scientists were competing to exploit nuclear fission to produce plutonium from uranium for the war. The teams included Werner Heisenberg s group in Berlin (later moved to Haigerloch to try to avoid Allied troops) and Kurt Diebner s team at Gottow. Uranium cubes were produced to fuel nuclear reactors at these sites. Measuring about 2 inches on each side, hundreds of the cubes were hung on cables submerged in  heavy  water, in which deuterium replaces lighter hydrogen. The scientists hoped radioactive decay of the uranium in the assemblies would unleash a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction   but the design failed. U.S. and British forces seized some of the Heisenberg uranium cubes at Haigerloch in 1945, and more than 600 of these cubes were shipped to the U.S. Some may have been used in the U.S. nuclear weapons effort   which was launched in part due to fears that Germany was developing nuclear weapons   and a few belong to collectors and sites including PNNL. The whereabouts of the others, including hundreds of Diebner cubes, are unknown. PNNL uses its sample to help train international border guards and nuclear forensics researchers to detect nuclear material. It s labeled as a Heisenberg cube, but support for that assertion is anecdotal, says Brittany Robertson, who is presenting the work at ACS Fall 2021.  We didn't have any actual measurements to back up that claim,  says Robertson, a doctoral student who works at the lab. To prove the cube s origins, she began modifying some analytical techniques to combine with Schwantes  established forensic methods. Robertson turned to radiochronometry, the nuclear field s version of a technique that geologists use to determine the age of samples based on radioactive isotope content. When the cubes were first cast, they contained fairly pure uranium metal. As time passed, radioactive decay transformed some of the uranium into thorium and protactinium. Robertson is adapting a radiochronometry procedure to better separate and quantify these elements in PNNL s cube. Their relative concentrations will show how long ago the cube was made. She is also refining this method to analyze rare-earth element impurities in the object. They could reveal where the original uranium was mined, which might indicate whether it was produced for the Heisenberg or Diebner group. Meanwhile, Robertson and Schwantes are collaborating with PNNL s Carlos Fraga, Ph.D., to test the cubes  coatings, which the Germans applied to limit oxidation. The PNNL team recently discovered that the cube at the University of Maryland is coated in styrene   an unexpected finding since Heisenberg s group used a cyanide-based coating. However, the team has now learned that some of the cubes from Diebner s group, which used a styrene-based coating, were sent to Heisenberg, who was trying to amass more fuel for his reactor.  We re curious if this particular cube was one of the ones associated with both research programs,  Schwantes says.  Also, this is an opportunity for us to test our science before we apply it in an actual nuclear forensic investigation.  While the scientists are intrigued about working with material from the dawn of the nuclear age, these objects are undeniably linked to a horrific time in history.  I m glad the Nazi program wasn't as advanced as they wanted it to be by the end of the war,  Robertson says,  because otherwise, the world would be a very different place.

It also could help aficionados attribute certain features of a cup of java to specific compounds, just as wine enthusiasts do. Brianne Linne, a graduate student who is presenting the work at the meeting, had previously studied tactile perception on the tongue when the opportunity to study coffee body arose.  From our background reading, we found definitions of coffee body to be very vague, and at times, contradictory, so we thought that this would be an intriguing topic for us to study,  she says. Linne is working with Simons and co-principal investigator Devin Peterson, Ph.D., on the project at The Ohio State University (OSU). The team set out to isolate the compounds responsible for coffee s mouthfeel by first establishing a descriptive analysis panel. They started with four different coffees that evaluators licensed by the Specialty Coffee Association had given varying ratings in terms of body. A separate panel of eight experienced tasters, skilled in tactile awareness, then agreed on a set of references that illustrated the sensations differentiating each cup.  To better define the term  body,  we broke it down into components that would allow us to look for the compounds driving those particular sensations,  says Simons. Four tactile sub-attributes, namely chalkiness, mouthcoating, astringency and thickness were used to differentiate the coffees. They separated the fullest-body coffee into 12 fractions using liquid chromatography and a panel of five tasters screened each fraction. If a majority ranked a sub-attribute strongly in a fraction, it was further purified to pinpoint the exact compound responsible. The researchers found that a cluster of small molecules contribute to coffee s mouthfeel. Peterson says they isolated melanoidin compounds, formed by the Maillard reaction during roasting, and for the first time associated them with astringency. Two compounds, 3- and 4-caffeoylquinic acid, correspond with mouthcoating. Unexpectedly, the sensation subsided with increased concentrations. Peterson says that although biological responses are multifaceted, it is uncommon for an attribute to be perceived at low levels, but not at high levels. Finally, they isolated a novel compound related to chalkiness that contains an amino acid. The team is now interested in whether there are mechanoreceptors in the mouth that detect these small molecules. According to Peterson, such receptors could be responsible for the decreased mouthcoating sensation that occurs with increasing caffeoylquinic acid. They also want to know more about how coffee bean growing conditions and roasting temperatures affect the compounds. With this knowledge, growers and producers could manipulate their processes to downplay or highlight the small molecules in a cup of coffee according to consumers  preferences.ReferencePresented at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society, Aug. 22-26 2021.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Until now, details of the mechanism that inactivates the expression of genes involved in the meiotic program during spermatogenesis had not been clarified. The researchers believe that this may lead to an advancement in reproductive medicine, like identifying causes for infertility from azoospermia or spermatogenic defects.Meiosis is the special type of cell division that takes place in the ovaries and testes to produce eggs and sperm by reducing the number chromosomes to half the original. After meiosis is complete, DNA continues to be highly condensed and undergoes major morphological changes that are characteristic of spermiogenesis. This process inactivates the expression of many genes that were previously active in carrying out meiosis in spermiogenesis. However, the details of the mechanism that completes the meiotic program at the appropriate time are unknown, and although this is an important issue that is directly related to reproductive medicine, such as male infertility, it has remained an unresolved issue many years.Professor Ishiguro's group at Kumamoto University s Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics (IMEG) previously discovered MEIOSIN, a gene that switches on meiosis and causes hundreds of genes involved in sperm and egg formation to activate simultaneously. Among them, many genes have functions that are still not fully understood. In their work to ascertain these functions, the researchers selected the ZFP541 gene to analyze in detail.When the function of the ZFP541 gene in mice was eliminated using genome editing, male germ cells started meiosis but died in the process resulting in infertility since no sperm were produced. A detailed analysis of the testes of those mice revealed that the ZFP541 gene plays an essential role in the regulation of meiosis and is an important gene involved in sperm production.Furthermore, ZFP541 is expressed in late meiotic prophase and binds to the regulatory regions (called promoters) of many meiosis-related genes. It is known that acetylated histones are present in the regulatory region of promoters as a marker for sustained activation of gene expression. Through mass spectrometry analysis, researchers found that ZFP541 binds to an unknown protein called KCTD19 and an enzyme called HDAC1 that has been shown by previous studies to remove acetyl groups from histones. These results show that ZFP541 and HDAC1 together eliminate the histone acetyl group, inactivate the expression of meiosis-related genes, and complete meiosis.""This research is a follow-up to our discovery of MEIOSIN published in February of 2020 and reveals part of the function of a gene under the control of MEIOSIN whose function is still unknown,"" said Dr. Yuki Takada, who led the study. ""Although these results were verified in mice, ZFP541 is also known to exist in humans. There are many cases of infertility in humans where the cause is unknown, but we expect that this result will contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of infertility, especially those related to sperm dysplasia.""Reference: Horisawa-Takada Y, Kodera C, Takemoto K, et al.

Immune cells play a central role in the immune response of mosquitoes toward malaria parasites and viruses after these pathogens are taken up upon feeding on an infected person. It s a field of study that has remained poorly understood due to the lack of genetic tools, said Ryan Smith, an associate professor of entomology at Iowa State University and lead author of the study. These experiments lay the foundation for a better understanding of how these immune cells function that could lead to a future when humans are able to make mosquitoes unable to transmit disease,  Smith said.The new study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing, a relatively new technique that allows researchers to examine the cellular messages within individual cells, to characterize mosquito immune cells, known as hemocytes. The study found mosquito hemocytes show greater complexity than previously thought, evidence of cell differentiation, and that some cells may even undergo a maturation process. The authors also provided comparative analysis to single-cell studies in other insect systems, highlighting important similarities and differences between mosquitoes and other insects. The new study is an important first step for future exploration of the mosquito immune system, which could be important for gaining better understanding of how mosquitoes transmit pathogens, such as malaria parasites, to humans through their bite. There s a big body of evidence that suggests that immune cells of mosquitoes are really critical to their ability to transmit disease,  Smith said.  From that perspective, we haven t really known a great deal about the molecular aspect of what those immune cells look like. Previous evidence suggests immune cells mediate disease pathways in mosquitoes, and play vital roles in killing malaria parasites at multiple stages in the mosquito host. The new study sets the stage for future research aimed at answering those questions, he said.Smith even envisions a future, though it s still years away, when this line of research could lead to the production of mosquitoes genetically modified to overexpress certain immune cell populations that reduce the ability of a mosquito to transmit pathogens that cause mosquito-borne disease. These resistant mosquitoes could then be introduced into wild mosquito populations to breed and spread these genetic traits. The result could be mosquito populations that are less likely to spread disease to humans, though Smith cautions it s all purely theoretical at this point.Reference: Kwon H, Mohammed M, Franz n O, Ankarklev J, Smith RC.

Misidentification can have a range of consequences, from a disgusting taste and mild illness to organ failure and even death. Culinary wild mushrooms staples, such as truffles or porcini, require symbiotic relationships with specific plants in the ecosystem that make it impractical or impossible to produce them commercially. This means they can only be harvested from their natural habitat, which is why porcini and truffles are often so expensive. Many food producers opt for common fungi that can be cultivated easily and grown in large quantities, such as oyster, shiitake, and portabella mushrooms.The United States has minimal regulations around the harvest and sale of wild fungi. Food products that tout  wild mushrooms  as ingredients are often vague and non-specific, making it impossible to know if the products are truly wild or just cultivated varieties, or even if they contain poisonous mushrooms harmful to humans. In a new study, researchers from the University of Utah (U) and the Natural History Museum of Utah (NHMU) used DNA barcoding techniques to test what mushroom species made up 16 food products that listed  wild mushrooms  on their labels. The authors sourced soups, dried mushrooms, powdered mushrooms, pasta sauces, and flavor enhancers from local grocery stores around Salt Lake City, Utah, and a large online retailer. They found 28 species of mushrooms across all 16 food products. Almost all products that claimed to have wild mushrooms consisted of cultivated species, including oyster, shiitake, or portabella mushrooms. Only five products had contents that were accurately described on the label, and some included species that likely have yet to be described in academic literature. One packet of dried wild mushrooms from the online retailer contained a species from a group of fungi that includes the  Death Cap,  a notoriously poisonous mushroom known to cause renal failure in humans.  If you looked at the reviews on this product, a surprising number of people wrote that the mushrooms  made me violently ill,  or that they had  never been so sick in my life,  said Dalley Cutler, lead author of the paper and a recent biology graduate at the U.  No one is checking if the mushrooms are what the labels say they are.  The authors contacted the online retailer to inform them of the potential dangers of the product. As of the paper s publication, the dried mushrooms are still for sale. The mislabeling across the wide range of products could be due of fraud, negligence, or just a lack of awareness.  There s an ignorance about mushrooms in general in food products, museum collections, the definition for wild mushrooms are all over the place,  said Alexander Bradshaw, co-author of the study and doctoral student at the U.  One package of dried mushrooms said it contained porcini, defined by a characteristic spongy texture underneath the cap. Just by looking at it, we knew it was untrue the mushrooms had gills underneath their caps. It seems like if you can dry it down, you can just slap a porcini label on it.  The authors say their results are inevitable partly because policies that regulate the international food supply chain vary wildly. Some parts of Europe require a license to collect edible wild mushrooms, but the guidelines differ between countries. In the U.S., state governments are responsible for regulating commercial wild mushrooms sales, but only 31 states have any regulations at all, according to a National Survey of State Regulation of Wild Mushroom Foraging for Retail Sale. Another reason for inconsistencies is because the field of mycology is vastly understudied.  About 95% of fungal species on Earth are undescribed. Fungi are so poorly documented, how do you regulate something that is virtually unknown?  said Bryn Dentinger, senior author of the paper, curator of mycology at the Natural History Museum of Utah, and associate professor of biology at the U.  This puts human health at risk, but it also puts our ecosystems at risk. Around the world, unsustainable harvesting practices could put rare and threatened species at risk of extinction.  There are still safe ways to enjoy wild mushrooms, the researchers say. Just know who you re buying from.  I don t want people to read this and be scared to eat porcini and other wild edible mushrooms, they are delicious,  said Dalley.  This study looked only at packaged products, not locally harvested wild mushrooms. I would encourage people that enjoy porcini and other wild edibles to only purchase from local sellers that are qualified in the identification of wild mushrooms.

With the establishment of the Melbourne Urological Research Alliance (MURAL), hundreds of Victorian men have generously donated samples of their cancer tissue, enabling the team to study a greater diversity of live tumours and test the efficacy of a larger variety of therapies for their ability to stop tumour growth.The PDX collection (patient-derived xenografts), developed by a multidisciplinary consortium and led by Professor Gail Risbridger and Associate Professor Renea Taylor at the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute (BDI), now comprises 59 tumours, collected from 30 patients between 2012 - 2020 and is now one of the largest collections of prostate cancer models in the world.Full characterisation of the PDX collection is published in Nature Communications.MURAL PDXs are an enduring resource of new cancer models that can be shared with other academic investigators or pharmaceutical companies.  The patients and their families are directly embedded in this venture, including the EJ Whitten Foundation who have been pivotal over the last 10 years in providing over $1M in donations enabling this resource to be developed and the program to come to the forefront of the international field. This project begins and ends with patients like EJ Whitten. We take patient tissue   do testing in the laboratory   and the discoveries then advance treatment for patients,  said Professor Risbridger.  Our new models of prostate cancer have attracted interest from scientists and the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.

But how certain are people about where they fit on it? A new University of Sydney study suggests that people s reported sexual orientation can change after reading about the nature of sexual orientation.Published in peer-reviewed journal, Nature s Scientific Reports, the study found that a significant number of heterosexual people report being less exclusive in their sexual orientation as well as more willing to have same-sex experiences after reading one of two 1-page informational articles.Lead author, Dr James Morandini, said:  Did we change people s sexual orientation via our interventions? Surely not. I think our study may have changed how people interpreted their underlying sexual feelings. This means two people with identical sexual orientations could describe their sexual orientation quite differently, depending on whether they have been exposed to fluid or continuous ways of understanding sexuality.  One informational article read by participants suggested that scientific research has found that there are many gradations of sexual attraction towards men and women, and people can fall anywhere along the continuum, from exclusive attraction to men to exclusive attraction to women. Another informational article showed that sexual orientation can change overtime, thus can be fluid.All participants self-identified as  straight  before the study began. Compared to a control group, after reading the first article, participants were 28 percent more likely to identify as non-exclusively heterosexual, and 19 percent indicated they would be more likely to be willing to engage in same-sex sexual activities. Overall, the rate of  non-exclusive heterosexuality  more than quadrupled after this activity. Similar, albeit weaker, effects were found when people read that sexual orientation is better characterised as fluid rather than stable throughout life.The study s senior author, Associate Professor Ilan Dar-Nimrod from the School of Psychology, said:  This is not that surprising given that  non-exclusive heterosexuals  (as opposed to bisexual, gay or lesbian individuals), although being the biggest same-sex attracted group, are not well captured in our society s representations and even vernacular. He added:  Given the social value that our society attach to these labels, however, such a shift may have far-reaching implications. It also suggests that certain level of same-sex sexual attraction may be much more common than previously estimated. Reference: Morandini JS, Dacosta L, Dar-Nimrod I.

Control bleomycin mice had lung fibrosis with widespread collagen deposition. The bleomycin mice that received ABT-199 had normal lung architecture at 21 days and no collagen deposition.These results suggest a novel therapeutic target to reverse fibrotic remodeling in the lungs, says study leader A. Brent Carter, M.D., professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Medicine. The research was also led by first author Linlin Gu, Ph.D., UAB Department of Medicine.Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic disease showing aberrant remodeling of lung tissue. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of pulmonary fibrosis and has a high mortality rate within three to five years. Currently approved medications have limited efficacy.ABT-199 acts by inducing apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung. Macrophages are large white blood cells that engulf and digest anything that does not have the surface proteins of healthy cells. Targets can include cancer cells, microbes and cellular debris.Previously, fibrosis progression was known to be associated with apoptosis resistance in lung macrophages, though the mechanism of that resistance was poorly understood. Also, existing dogma did not point to macrophages as actors in fibrosis; it instead proposed that increased alveolar epithelial cell injury and apoptosis were the initiating events in lung fibrosis.Apoptosis is a regulated suicide process for cells that are a threat to the organism or are no longer needed. Mitochondria, the organelles that are the powerhouses of the cell, play a key role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Carter, Gu and UAB colleagues   seeking to better understand the mechanism of how lung macrophages become apoptotic resistant   soon learned that the mitochondria also play a key role in apoptosis resistance.Using lung lavage, they isolated macrophages from people with IPF. They found a marked increase in the macrophage mitochondrial protein Bcl-2   a regulator of apoptosis   as compared to lung macrophages from people without IPF. Mitochondrial Bcl-2 was also elevated in lung macrophages from bleomycin-exposed mice that have lung fibrosis.Besides increased Bcl-2 in the mitochondria of lung macrophages from bleomycin mice, Carter and colleagues also found two proteins   MCU and Cpt1a   showed a similar increase in expression. The MCU protein is a channel to bring calcium into the mitochondria, and Cpt1a is an enzyme in mitochondria that is the rate-limiting step for the fatty acid beta-oxidation energy pathway. MCU was previously known to regulate metabolic reprogramming of lung macrophages to fatty acid oxidation, as well as act in the progression of lung fibrosis and apoptosis resistance.The researchers found that Bcl-2 was regulated by MCU, and that silencing MCU caused a significant decrease for Bcl-2 in the mitochondria of lung macrophages. They found that MCU modulated the binding of Cpt1a to a particular domain of Bcl-2, which anchored Bcl-2 in the mitochondria to attenuate apoptosis. This interaction was dependent on Cpt1a activity.Looking again at lung macrophages from people with IPF, they found a direct correlation between the levels of Cpt1a and Bcl-2; the amounts in macrophages from different individuals varied in tandem.Importantly, Carter and colleagues found that mice with a conditional deletion of Bcl-2 in lung macrophages were protected from pulmonary fibrosis in the bleomycin model, and they were also protected from asbestos-induced lung fibrosis. These conditional deletion results set the stage for the experiments showing that the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 was able to reverse fibrosis in the mouse bleomycin model. Furthermore, ABT-199 completely blocked the Cpt1a-Bcl-2 interaction. In additional genetic evidence, fibrosis was also reversed by the conditional deletion of Bcl-2 in mice with established fibrosis. Taken together, these observations suggest that fatty acid oxidation provokes apoptosis resistance through the stabilization of Bcl-2 in the mitochondria by binding to Cpt1a,  Carter said.  Moreover, these data demonstrate that monocyte-derived macrophages are required for fibrosis progression, and they suggest a novel therapeutic target to prevent progressive aberrant fibrotic remodeling.

In a study published in Nature Metabolism, the team reported that irisin, secreted by the muscles during exercise, could be an effective therapeutic for addressing deficits of the brain that result from Alzheimer s disease.  Preserving cognitive function is a major challenge in an increasingly aging population,  says Christiane Wrann, DVM, PhD, leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at MGH and senior author of the study.  Exercise is known to have positive effects on brain health, which is why identifying key mediators of those neuroprotective benefits, like irisin, has become such a critical goal of research.  Using mouse models, the team showed that genetic deletion of irisin impairs cognitive function in exercise, aging and Alzheimer s disease, which was in part caused by alterations of newborn neurons in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is the compartment of the brain that stores memories and is the first to show signs of Alzheimer s disease. At the same time, the MGH study found that elevating irisin levels in the bloodstream improved cognitive function and neuroinflammation in mouse models for Alzheimer s disease.  For the first time, we showed that soluble irisin, and not its full-length parent protein FNDC5, is sufficient to confer the benefits of exercise on cognitive function,  explains Wrann, who is also an assistant professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.  These effects can possibly go well beyond what exercise itself can bring. This is particularly important inasmuch as irisin, a small natural peptide, would be much easier to develop into a therapeutic than the much larger membrane-bound protein FNDC5.  While previous research used the parent protein FNDC5, she adds, scientists this time delivered only the irisin portion through an adeno-associated viral vector approach to the liver, similar to gene replacement therapy, and discovered irisin was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and directly affect the brain. What makes this study particularly strong is that we show irisin s effect on cognitive function in not one but four different mouse models,  states Bruce Spiegelman of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, who discovered irisin in 2012 and is a co-author of the current paper. Researchers were further encouraged by the fact that irisin treatment was effective in Alzheimer s disease mouse models even after the development of significant pathology.  This could have implications for intervention in humans with Alzheimer s disease where therapy typically starts after patients have become symptomatic,  Wrann says.Another important finding of the study is that irisin protects against neuroinflammation by acting directly on glia cells in the brain. Co-author Rudy Tanzi, co-director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at MGH, explains:  It s hard to imagine anything better for brain health than daily exercise, and our findings shed new light on the mechanism involved: protecting against neuroinflammation, perhaps the biggest killer of brain neurons as we age.  Adds Wrann:  Since irisin does not specifically target amyloid plaques, but rather neuroinflammation directly, we re optimistic it could have beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases beyond just Alzheimer s.

Approximately one-third of the global population is infected with the latent form of Mtb. Bacillus Calmette-Gu rin (BCG) is widely used as a vaccine against tuberculosis but has a variable protection against neonatal and adult pulmonary TB. That protection can, however, range from zero to 80% among infants. Children are routinely vaccinated, yet Mtb dissemination into brain and tuberculosis meningitis continues to occur.Purdue and Houston Methodist researchers have created this novel TB vaccine formulation by incorporating autophagy-mediated antigen presentation, which initiates an enhanced T cell response. Chinnaswamy Jagannath, professor of pathology and genomic medicine at the Houston Methodist Research Institute, which is an affiliate of Weill Cornell Medical College, showed that the novel formulation improves the development of tuberculosis-specific immune responses. Jagannath collaborates with Dr. Suresh Mittal, Distinguished Professor of Virology in Purdue's College of Veterinary Medicine.""Our vaccine approach is equally effective without or with prior vaccination with BCG,"" Mittal said.""It is vital since the majority of people in Mtb-endemic countries are already immunized with BCG,"" Jagannath said.Mittal's lab studies delivery platforms for vaccines, and Jagannath's lab used the nasal delivery route for this TB vaccine development.""The great thing about this work with TB is that it can translate to other infectious diseases and possibly cancer immunotherapy,"" Mittal said.The innovators have worked with the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization to patent their technology. The innovators and OTC are looking for partners to continue developing it. The next step for the vaccine formulation is to conduct a vaccine efficacy study in a nonhuman primate model. Mittal said the successful completion of the study will form the basis for a human trial, though no human trial is currently planned.Reference: Khan A, Sayedahmed EE, Singh VK, et al.

New U.S. Army-funded research uses gene editing to render certain male mosquitoes infertile and slow the spread of these diseases.Researchers at the Army s Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies and the University of California Santa Barbara used a gene editing tool known as CRISPR-Cas9 to target a specific gene tied to fertility in male mosquitoes. CRISPR-Cas9 is a genome editing tool that is creating a buzz in the science world, according to yourgenome.org. It is  faster, cheaper and more accurate than previous techniques of editing DNA and has a wide range of potential applications. Researchers experimented with the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions throughout the world. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, discerned how a mutation can suppress the fertility of female mosquitoes. This is yet one more important and exciting example of how synthetic biology tools are demonstrating unparalleled utility,  said Dr. James Burgess, ICB program manager for the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, now known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory.  In this case, it s a precision increase from chainsaw to a scalpel leading to the correct biochemical outcome that could substantially reduce the population of a very infectious mosquito. To manage populations, scientists use a vector-control practice called the sterile insect technique in which they raise a lot of sterile male insects and they then release these males in numbers that overwhelm their wild counterparts. Females that mate with sterile males before finding a fertile one are themselves rendered infertile, thereby decreasing the size of the next generation.Repeating this technique several times has the potential to crash the population because each generation is smaller than the last; releasing a similar number of sterile males has a stronger effect over time.The sterile insect technique is effective in managing a number of agricultural pests, including the Mediterranean fruit fly, a crop pest in California. It has also been attempted with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, but with limited success.In the past, scientists used chemicals or radiation to sterilize male Aedes aegypti, but the chemicals or radiation impacted the mosquitos  health to such an extent that they were less successful in mating with females, which undercuts the effectiveness of the sterile insect technique.The research team wanted to identify a more targeted approach with less collateral damage, mutating a gene in mosquitoes that specifically caused male sterility without otherwise impacting the insects  health. When CRISPR/Cas9 came out several years ago it just offered new opportunities to do things that you couldn t do before,  said Dr. Craig Montell, distinguished professor at UC Santa Barbara.  So, the time seemed right to for us to start working on Aedes aegypti. Using gene editing in male Aedes aegypti, researchers found that the mutant male mosquitos produced no sperm, and unlike in previous efforts, the sterile studs were otherwise completely healthy; however, the team wasn t sure whether sperm, albeit defective sperm from the sterile males, was needed to render female mosquitoes infertile, or whether the transfer of seminal fluid was all it took.In one experiment, researchers introduced 15 mutant males into a group of 15 females for 24 hours. Then they swapped the males for 15 wild-type males, and left them there. Essentially, all of the females remained sterile,  Montell said.  This confirmed that males could suppress female fertility without producing sperm. Next the researchers set out to determine how timing played into the effect. They exposed the females to mutant males for different lengths of time. The scientists noticed little difference after 30 minutes, but female fertility quickly dropped after that. Montell noted that females copulated twice on average, even during the first 10 minutes. This indicated that females have to mate with many sterile males before being rendered infertile themselves.Combining the females with the males for four hours cut female fertility to 20% of normal levels. After eight hours the numbers began leveling out around 10%.According to Montell, Aedes aegypti populations could easily bounce back from an 80% drop in fertility. The success of sterile insect technique comes from subsequent, successive releases of sterile males, where each release will be more effective than the last as sterile males account for an ever-growing proportion of the population.The team plans to continue investigating mosquito mating behaviors and fertility. They are devising a way to maintain stocks of males so they are only sterile in the wild and not in the lab. In addition, they are characterizing male mating behavior to uncover new ways to suppress mosquito populations. We ve become very interested in studying many aspects of behavior in Aedes aegypti because these mosquitoes impact the health of so many people,  Montell said.  There is a pandemic every year from mosquito-borne diseases. Reference: Zhan Y, Alonso San Alberto D, Rusch C, Riffell JA, Montell C.

While none of the monkeys in the study were depressed, the findings still offer a plausible biochemical explanation for the drug s side effects, particularly in young patients. The paper was published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences.Prozac is the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the world and is approved in the United States for treating children as young as 8 years old with major depressive disorder and 7 years old with obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is a certain amount of controversy surrounding this use, with some studies claiming the drug might actually increase the likelihood of suicidal thinking and behaviour and that this side effect could be more pronounced in young patients. This makes biochemical research into how fluoxetine  the active compound in Prozac  affects the brain, particularly in young age, highly relevant.A series of earlier studies on the same group of animals carried out by the team s collaborators investigated the effects of two-year fluoxetine administration to juvenile macaques on their impulsivity, sleep, social interaction, and the concentration of peripheral metabolites   the products of metabolism measured in the blood. This time, the researchers observed the drug s effects on gene expression and brain metabolite content, primarily that of biomolecules called lipids. Lipids have long been known as the building blocks of cell membranes and as the molecules storing energy in the body s fat tissue. More recently, their importance for proper brain functioning has become increasingly apparent. Lipids are abundant in the brain, where they are found not just in the cell membranes of neurons, whose properties they modulate, but also in the so-called myelin sheaths insulating axons  the brain s  wiring.  The brain is therefore a surprisingly  fat  organ   in fact, it is nearly 60% fat,  the study s first author, Anna Tkachev from Skoltech, said.Biochemical brain research has tied lipid abnormalities to diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer s, making these molecules an important marker of brain health.While the study only found slight variations in gene expression and insignificant changes in nonlipid metabolite content, decreased concentrations were observed for many of the over 300 lipids measured in the post-mortem brains of the macaques using a technique called mass spectrometry. The affected lipids were those that either incorporate what s known as polyunsaturated fatty acids or are PUFAs occurring on their own, and not as part of larger lipid molecules. These so-called free PUFAs exhibited the most dramatic drop in their concentration. A familiar example of PUFAs are the omega-3 fatty acids, which humans ingest with sea fish and some other foods. They are important for health in general and for mental health in particular. One clue as to why the antidepressant might have more adverse effects when administered to young patients is that the younger a child s age, the more rapid are the natural changes in the brain. Until the age of two, babies ramp up their brain PUFA content very rapidly, which explains one of the health benefits of breastfeeding: Breast milk is rich in fats and provides lipid building blocks for brain development. Although this lipid accumulation phase slows down progressively, it might not be 100% over in young teenagers, which is roughly the age equivalent of the juvenile macaques we studied,  Tkachev conjectured.Examining the animals  metabolite content in the blood, the researchers saw tentative indications of an overall PUFA drop in the body, though this was not nearly as pronounced as in the prelimbic cortex  the part of the brain analyzed in the paper. One important distinction between humans and macaques is that we have the alternative of ingesting PUFAs with fish, meat, and some other foods not typically consumed by macaques. They have to rely on their own livers to synthesize PUFAs. This means that if further research determines that the imbalances we observed have to do with disrupted lipid synthesis, this adverse effect could be alleviated in humans with a proper diet,  Tkachev explained. For this reason, it is necessary to measure metabolite content in human blood, and the traces of lipid imbalances left in macaque blood give reason to hope we might just find something similar in humans, without the need to actually dissect anyone s brain,  the researcher went on.  If we don t, it might be a sign of the imbalances stemming from factors other than synthesis disruptions, such as lipids having trouble entering the brain or possibly undergoing a redistribution toward other brain regions. New animal studies similar to ours but focusing on other brain parts could control for that. Reference: Tkachev A, Stekolshchikova E, Bobrovskiy DM, et al.

Sensitive gas sensing and monitoring technologies are, therefore, a pressing need. Of much recent research interest in this field are the novel organic field-effect transistor-based (OFET) sensors, which are highly sensitive, flexible, and lightweight, opening doors to portable gas sensors even on e-skins. However, OFETs are unstable, and therefore not durable, at room temperature. This limits their applicability and makes them inferior to existing inorganic sensors, which nonetheless, do not possess any of the flexibility and light weight of organic sensors.Bridging the organic inorganic gap, scientists from Incheon National University, Korea, led by Prof. Yeong Don Park, have created hybrid OFETs using a organic conjugated polymer and variations of an inorganic nanoporous material, zeolite. Their study was made available online on 6 April 2021 and will be published in Volume 420 Part 1 of Chemical Engineering Journal on 15 September 2021. The high degree of porosity in zeolite results in an exceptionally high specific surface area and, in turn, a strong adsorption response for small gas molecules. This also helps it adsorb the molecules in air that oxidize (react with) the gas sensor to destabilize it and reduce its durability.  explains Prof. Park. Their material boasts not only high durability, but also high sensitivity.The team fabricated two OFET-based NO2 sensors using a combination of the conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and one of two zeolite materials, PST-11 or Omega. They examined the sensing performances of both OFETs when exposed to NO2 gas. The hybridization provided the polymer with an orderly structure which in turn led to efficient interactions with the gas molecules and, consequently, high sensitivity. Among the two, the scientists observed that the PST-11 P3HT film was more sensitive to NO2 than the Omega P3HT film due to a larger specific surface area.Overall, Prof. Park explains:  Our approach represents a new way of conceptualizing the design and development of sensors. If our research is refined further, people can easily detect harmful gases in real time.  Speaking of his vision, he says:  Our devices can be integrated with wearable devices such as smart watches and e-skins to allow people to know about air pollution levels in areas other than industrial sites. While a pollution-free world is our end goal, it certainly wouldn t hurt to stay safe while we get there.Reference: Kwon EH, An H, Park MB, Kim M, Park YD.

Now, researchers show that some people turned to a variety of drugs for relief. Using wastewater analysis, the team identified a spike in consumption of easily abused prescription opioids and anti-anxiety sedatives, while some illicit drug use plummeted, between March and June 2020.Previously, Bikram Subedi, Ph.D., and his research group used residues in wastewater to study illicit drug consumption in rural communities. With the onset of COVID-19 restrictions, the team turned to wastewater again.  We hypothesized that some of the drug profiles would be different, and personal drug use behavior would be altered due to isolation, loss of jobs and loss of life,  says Subedi, who is the principal investigator on the project.The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. By June 2020, about 40% of adults in the U.S. were struggling with their mental health, and 13% of those had started or increased their substance use, according to survey results published in an August 2020 paper by another team. So, to get an idea of community-wide habits and anxiety levels at the start of the pandemic, Subedi s team at Murray State University used wastewater epidemiology. They calculated per capita consumption for a diverse set of drugs based on their presence in sewage entering treatment plants. With this technique, the researchers developed comprehensive and nearly real-time patterns of prescription and illicit drug use, which are important to public health authorities, law-enforcement and other agencies. The researchers collected raw sewage samples from treatment facilities in two towns in western Kentucky and northwest Tennessee, says Alexander Montgomery, a graduate student who is presenting the work. Back in the lab, they measured the levels of easily abused prescription medications, illicit drugs and their metabolites. As Montgomery explains, the team took extra precautions with these samples because no one knew if SARS-CoV-2 could survive in wastewater.  I had to be extremely careful with every step of the extraction and handling process,  he says. Their results showed that consumption of hydrocodone   one of the most abused prescription opioids   spiked by 72% from March to June 2020. The researchers suggest the change was because people had easier access to doctors as they switched to telemedicine appointments. Conversely, the use of illicit stimulants dropped by 16% for methamphetamine and 40% for cocaine. The researchers suggest that travel restrictions limited interstate and international trafficking of these drugs.  Our results match with all of the sources that we could find pertaining to other drug estimations in the community,  says Montgomery, including declines in city and state police methamphetamine and cocaine seizures. And now, even more recent data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nationwide, drug overdose deaths increased by nearly 30% from the prior year with the majority caused by opioid overdoses. Overdose deaths from fentanyl-laced illegal stimulants also increased in 2020. At the same time, the prevalence of benzodiazepines   anxiety-related sedatives   was elevated by nearly 30% and antidepressants increased by 40%. In a related project that is also being presented by Subedi s team at ACS Fall 2021, they examined the same wastewater samples for isoprostanes   hormones that indicate oxidative stress and anxiety   and found their levels rose significantly.  That tells us as people s anxiety levels increased, the levels of prescription drug consumption also increased,  Subedi says, aligning with additional interventions recommended by health professionals to treat elevated mental health issues.  The trends that we are reporting are only for the first four months of the early COVID-19 pandemic, and they may not be true for an extended period of time,  Subedi says. Although the pandemic is now receding in some parts of the world, the team continues monthly wastewater sampling. Subedi notes that monitoring the trends of drug use and community-level anxiety post-pandemic will help explain the overall effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on people s lives.ReferencePresented at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society, Aug. 22-26 2021.

This dietary intervention, when put in the context of different intervention studies, was extremely successful,  said Jamie Cooper, a professor in the FACS department of nutritional sciences and one of the study s authors.  We had some people who actually went from having high cholesterol at the start of the study to no longer being in that category after the intervention. Researchers saw an average drop of 5% in total cholesterol and between 6% and 9% in LDL among participants who consumed pecans.For context, researchers referred to a previous meta-analysis of 51 exercise interventions designed to lower cholesterol that reported an average reduction of 1% in total cholesterol and 5% in LDL cholesterol. The addition of pecans to the diet not only produced a greater and more consistent reduction in total cholesterol and LDL compared to many other lifestyle interventions, but may also be a more sustainable approach for long-term health,  Cooper said.  Some research shows that even a 1% reduction in LDL is associated with a small reduction of coronary artery disease risk, so these reductions are definitely clinically meaningful. Researchers assigned 52 adults between the ages of 30 and 75 who were at higher risk for cardiovascular disease to one of three groups.One group consumed 68 grams or about 470 calories of pecans a day as part of their regular diet; a second group substituted pecans for a similar amount of calories from their habitual diet, and a control group did not consume pecans.At eight weeks, participants consumed a high-fat meal to determine changes in blood lipids and the amount of glucose, or sugar, in the blood.Fasted blood lipids showed similar improvements among the two pecan groups while post-meal triglycerides were reduced in the group that added pecans. Post-meal glucose was lowered in the group that substituted pecans. Whether people added them or substituted other foods in the diet for them, we still saw improvements and pretty similar responses in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in particular,  said Cooper, who also serves as director of the UGA Obesity Initiative.Researchers pointed to the known bioactive properties of pecans for possible mechanisms driving the improvements.Pecans are high in healthy fatty acids and fiber, both of which have been linked to lower cholesterol.Reference: Guarneiri LL, Paton CM, Cooper JA.

These detailed prion structures provide a new premise for understanding and targeting these currently untreatable diseases,  said Allison Kraus, lead and co-corresponding author of the research and an assistant professor in the Department of Pathology at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine.  It will now be much easier to develop and test hypotheses about how prions are assembled as highly infectious and deadly protein structures. Seeing the basic building blocks of these lethal proteins, she said, provides a foundation for therapeutic strategies to block the spread, buildup and toxicity of prions. Prions are proteins in brain tissue that transmit their irregular  misfolded  shapes onto the regular version of the same protein and are the source of mammalian diseases, including human conditions like Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) and its variant, known as vCJD, as well as Gerstmann Str ussler Scheinker syndrome, and others. Similar prion-like mechanisms occur in the characteristic proteins suspected in the development of other neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson s disease, Lou Gehrig s disease (also known as ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer s disease. Though instances are rare, prion diseases can be transmitted between people; others are readily transmissible between animals, such as chronic wasting disease. For this study, researchers imaged rodent-adapted scrapie prions derived from the brains of clinically ill hamsters.Using cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at both NIH and the Cleveland Center for Structural and Membrane Biology Cryo-Electron Microscopy Core facilities at Case Western Reserve and a collaborative pipeline between the Kraus (CWRU), Byron Caughey (NIH) and Research Technologies Branch (NIH) groups, researchers were able to determine aspects of the basic building blocks of these proteins, including the placements of their amino acids. By suspending the prions in ice, cryo-electron technology allowed researchers take thousands of images of the protein assemblies to build 3D atomic-resolution models using proprietary software. This successful first-ever imaging to reach atomic-level detail of a brain-derived prion opens the door for similar  solving of other prion structures,  said Kraus. The study also obtained lower resolution images of another distinct prion strain that revealed structural differences between the two strains.  It s thought that there are many variations in prion structures as they relate to different diseases,  said Kraus.  Higher-resolution images provide clarity to many aspects of the cause and progression of these infectious diseases that are uniquely caused in nature by proteins not viruses or bacteria.

But many people are now open to trying plant-based alternatives, as long as they closely resemble the taste, odor, appearance and texture of real beef. Now, researchers report that the aromas of a couple of plant-based burgers come close to the real deal when they are cooking, though other products still have a long way to go. The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  During the last several years, increasing awareness of the impact of meat production on climate change, as well as meat shortages during the pandemic, have made people more accepting of plant-based alternatives,  says LiLi Zyzak, Ph.D., the project s principal investigator.  There are a lot of products out there, and food companies are doing interesting research, but nobody ever publishes anything because it s a trade secret.  Although plant-based meat products have been available for more than 20 years, early versions were very different from traditional meat. In recent years, many food companies have done extensive research on how to make proteins from plants such as soy and pea taste more like beef. Newer companies, such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, are competing with industry giants, such as Kellogg s, Tyson Foods and Nestl  in this market. Raw hamburger has very little odor, but cooking it releases hundreds of volatile compounds that contribute to taste and aroma.  The problem with plant-based burgers is that the plant protein itself contributes a strong odor,  says Zyzak, who is at Eastern Kentucky University.  For example, pea protein smells like green, cut grass, so companies have to find a way to mask that aroma. Some use heavy seasonings.  Another challenge is determining the correct blend of vegetable oils to mimic the fatty meat smell. Although Zyzak admits she is a  through-and-through meat and potatoes person,  she was curious how plant-based burgers stack up.  We wanted to give consumers an idea of what s out there so that they can make informed decisions at the grocery store,  she says. The researchers analyzed the aroma compounds produced by cooking real hamburger and eight popular brands of plant-based burgers. As a first step, they cooked the burgers and evaluated the aromas using five descriptors: meaty, fatty, buttery, sweet and roasted. Then, they used gas chromatography   mass spectrometry (GC/MS) combined with olfactometry to correlate the aromas with specific odor compounds. To do this, the team injected volatiles from the cooking burgers into the GC/MS instrument, which separated the compounds. Some of the sample was diverted to a sniffing port, where a person clicked a button when they smelled an individual odor. Using a microphone, the person said which of the five descriptors it smelled like (for example,  buttery ). The remaining sample was analyzed by MS, and the researchers correlated specific compounds with the aroma smelled by the person at a certain time. The team then identified the compounds that caused the plant-based burgers to differ from traditional hamburger. Of the alternatives tested so far, the Beyond Burger from Beyond Meat most closely resembled the odor profile of actual hamburger, with meaty, fatty and grilled meat characteristics from the compounds 1-octen-3-ol, octanal and nonanal; however, it was still significantly different from the real thing. Another brand had the closest appearance to real raw hamburger, but upon cooking, it had a yeast- or bread-like odor, with higher levels of methyl butanals and propionic acid. A number of the other brands had heavy seasonings that released strong garlicky or barbecue-sauce-like aromas. Ultimately, Zyzak would like to use what she s learned to produce a mixture of odor compounds that closely mimic hamburger aroma. She s also working with a startup company to obtain samples of cell-based meat (lab-grown meat that is produced by animal cells in fermentation tanks), which she plans to compare with plant-based and regular burgers.ReferencePresented at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society, Aug. 22-26 2021.

This work demonstrates that we can make organoids that resemble real human brain tissue and can be used to accurately replicate certain features of human brain function and disease,  said Bennett Novitch, a member of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center and senior author of the study.Over the past decade, researchers have discovered how to take cells from a person s body, such as skin or blood cells, coax them in the lab to become induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, and then direct those cells to form any type of cell found in the body   including neurons. Scientists now can even encourage iPS cells to aggregate into three-dimensional forms, creating organoids that look more like miniature human organs than cells in a flat dish.That advance has enabled scientists to study how one person s cells might be different than the norm, and to carry out experiments that aren t possible in living humans   manipulating the genetics of kidney cells, or using lung organoids to study how COVID-19 infects and damages the lungs, for instance.When it comes to the human brain, however, creating an organoid that mimics the organ s structural complexity is particularly challenging. Getting the cells to organize like they would in a human brain is just part of the battle.The cells also must connect with one another and function like neurons would in a human brain. Healthy human brain cells not only send electrical signals throughout the brain in response to stimuli, but also have coordinated waves of activity called neural oscillations or brainwaves. Distinct patterns of brainwaves are associated with specific activities   learning or sleeping, for example   and abnormalities in these patterns can be an indication of disease. With many neurological diseases, you can have terrible symptoms but the brain physically looks fine,  said Dr. Ranmal Samarasinghe, a member of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center and first author of the paper.  So to be able to seek answers to questions about these diseases, it s very important that with organoids we can model not just the structure of the brain but the function as well. After producing a batch of brain organoids derived from the skin cells of healthy people, Novitch, Samarasinghe and colleagues at the UCLA Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center used two different approaches to study the patterns of electrical activity inside them   one involved inserting a probe into each organoid to measure brain activity, the other watching the brain cells in action under a microscope.Some of the information they gathered was akin to the data scientists would normally find in brain scans called electroencephalograms, or EEGs. The analysis showed multiple kinds of neural oscillations. I hadn t anticipated the range of oscillation patterns we would see,  said Novitch, who is also UCLA s Ethel Scheibel Professor of Neuroscience.  By learning how to control which oscillation patterns an organoid exhibits, we may be able to eventually model different brain states. Next, the team developed brain organoids using cells from people with Rett syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with learning delays, repetitive movements and seizures. While the organoids appeared normal in structure and organization, their neural oscillations were abnormal: They lacked the variety of oscillations demonstrated in the non-Rett organoids. Instead, the Rett organoids had fast, disorganized activity like what clinicians see in EEGs of people with Rett syndrome and related disorders.When Novitch and Samarasinghe treated the Rett organoids with an experimental drug called Pifithrin-alpha, the seizure-associated activity patterns disappeared, and the organoids  neural activity became more normal.The use of organoids to study brain disorders will remain limited because organoids don t replicate every aspect of a human brain   they lack blood vessels, for instance   and they resemble brains in early development rather than adult brains. But the UCLA study suggests that they could nevertheless be used to test a wide range of brain functions, disorders and drugs that couldn t be studied with brain cells in a Petri dish. This is one of the first tangible examples of drug testing in action in a brain organoid,  said Samarasinghe, who is also an assistant professor of neurology.  We hope it serves as a stepping stone toward a better understanding of human brain biology and brain disease. Reference: Samarasinghe RA, Miranda OA, Buth JE, et al.

But a USC-led team of scientists has managed to borrow some of nature s pages through a comprehensive analysis of how kidneys form their filtering units, known as nephrons. Published in the journal Developmental Cell, the study from Andy McMahon s lab in the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at USC was led by Nils Lindstr m, who started the research as a postdoctoral fellow and is now an assistant professor in the same department. The study also brought in the expertise of collaborators from Princeton University and the University of Edinburgh in the UK. The team traced the blueprints for how cells interact to lay the foundations of the human kidney, and how abnormal developmental processes could contribute to disease. Their findings are publicly available as part of the Human Nephrogenesis Atlas (https://sckidney.flatironinstitute.org/),  which is a searchable database showing when and where genes are active in the developing human kidney, and predicting regulatory interactions going on in developing cell types.  There s only one way to build a kidney, and that s nature s way,  said McMahon, who is the director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC.  Only by understanding the logical framework of normal embryonic development can we improve our ability to synthesize cell types, model disease and ultimately build functional systems to replace defective kidneys. To reconstruct nature s molecular and cellular blueprints, the team studied hundreds of human and mouse nephrons at various points along their typical developmental trajectories. This allowed the researchers to compare important processes that have been conserved during the nearly 200 million years of evolution since humans and mice diverged from their common mammalian ancestor.The study details the similar genetic machinery that underpins nephron formation in humans and mice, enabling other groups of scientists to follow the logic of these developmental programs to make new types of kidney cells. All told, there are at least 20 specialized cell types that form the kidney s intricate tubular network, which helps maintain the body s fluid and pH balance, filter the blood, and concentrate toxins into the urine for excretion. By generating detailed views of the beautifully complex process by which human nephrons form, we aim to enhance our understanding of development and disease, while guiding efforts to build synthetic kidney structures,  said Lindstr m. The scientists were also able to determine the precise positions of expressed genes with known roles in Congenital Abnormalities of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT). In specific types of cells, the researchers identified networks of interacting genes. Based on these associations, the team predicted new candidate genes to explore in CAKUT and other kidney diseases.  Our approach of inferring spatial coordinates for genes expressed in individual cells could be widely used to create similar atlases of other developing organ systems something that is an important focus of many research groups around the world,  said Lindstr m.  The study exemplifies the impact of collaborative science bringing together expertise across the US and Europe to connect developmental anatomy with cutting-edge molecular, computational and microscopy tools.

Arthropods are the most diverse and species-rich taxonomic group of animals and include insects, crustaceans, spiders and scorpions, as well as other, less familiar lineages such as millipedes and centipedes.The fossils, belonging to an arthropod known as Leanchoilia, confirm the presence   predicted by earlier studies in genetics and developmental biology of insect and spider embryos   of an extreme frontal domain of the brain that is not segmented and is invisible in modern adult arthropods. Despite being invisible, this frontal domain gives rise to several crucial neural centers in the adult arthropod brain, including stem cells that eventually provide centers involved in decision-making and memory. This frontal domain was hypothesized to be distinct from the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain seen in living arthropods, and it was given the name prosocerebrum, with ""proso"" meaning ""front.""Described in a paper published today in the journal Current Biology, the fossils provide the first evidence of the existence of this discrete prosocerebral brain region, which has a legacy that shows up during the embryonic development of modern arthropods, according to paper lead author Nicholas Strausfeld, a Regents Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Arizona.""The extraordinary fossils we describe are unlike anything that has been seen before,"" Strausfeld said. ""Two nervous systems, already unique because they are identically preserved, show that half a billion years ago this most anterior brain region was present and structurally distinct before the evolutionary appearance of the three segmental ganglia that denote the fore-, mid- and hindbrain.""The term ganglion refers to a system of networks forming a nerve center that occurs in each segment of the nervous system of an arthropod. In living arthropods, the three ganglia that mark the three-part brain condensed together to form a solid mass, obscuring their evolutionary origin as segmented structures.","Published: August 23, 2021"

We would like to thank Dr. Santra and the whole team in Birmingham for their efforts and collaboration to achieve this milestone moment of dosing the first MMA patient with our mRNA therapeutic,  said Ruchira Glaser, M.D., Sr. Vice President and Therapeutic Area Head, Rare Disease, Autoimmune & Cardiovascular.  This is another step forward in Moderna s mission to deliver on the promise of mRNA science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients. We are delighted to have been able to treat the first patient in the world with this new medicine here in Birmingham,  Saikat Santra, M.D., Pediatric Inherited Metabolic Medicine Consultant, Clinical Inherited Metabolic Disorders at Birmingham Women s and Children s NHS Foundation Trust.  We sincerely hope that it brings this brave patient, and many more like them, a brighter future free of the restrictions of this terrible disease. Methylmalonic acidemia is a rare, life-threatening, inherited metabolic disorder that is most commonly (approximately 60% of cases) caused by a deficiency in the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonic-CoA mutase (MUT). This deficiency can lead to metabolic crises due to a toxic buildup of acids in the body and progresses into multi-organ disease. As a result, MMA is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, and there are no approved therapies. Standard of care includes dietary and palliative measures. Currently, liver or combined liver and kidney transplant is the only effective treatment.Moderna recognizes the impact of rare diseases on patients and their families, particularly when the disease lacks effective treatment options. In addition to MMA, Moderna is working to advance mRNA therapeutics that restore the activity of missing enzymes responsible for other rare diseases, such as propionic acidemia (PA), glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) and phenylketonuria (PKU). Moderna has active clinic programs in five different therapeutic areas: infectious disease, oncology, cardiovascular, rare disease and autoimmune disease. ","Published: August 23, 2021"

Clinical trial data assessed by a dedicated team of MHRA scientists and clinicians has shown that Ronapreve may be used to prevent infection, promote resolution of symptoms of acute COVID-19 infection and can reduce the likelihood of being admitted to hospital due to COVID-19.Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: The UK is considered a world leader in identifying and rolling out life-saving treatments for COVID-19, once they have been proven safe and effective in our government-backed clinical trials. This is fantastic news from the independent medicines regulator and means the UK has approved its first therapeutic designed specifically for COVID-19. This treatment will be a significant addition to our armoury to tackle COVID-19   in addition to our world-renowned vaccination programme and life-saving therapeutics dexamethasone and tocilizumab.  We are now working at pace with the NHS and expert clinicians to ensure this treatment can be rolled out to NHS patients as soon as possible. We are pleased to announce the approval of another therapeutic treatment that can be used for to help save lives and protect against COVID-19. Ronapreve is the first of its kind for the treatment of COVID-19, and after a meticulous assessment of the data by our expert scientists and clinicians, we are satisfied that this treatment is safe and effective.

And while the COVID-19 vaccines represent the best measure to prevent the disease, therapies for those who do get infected remain in short supply.A new groundbreaking study from the University of Michigan reveals several drug contenders already in use for other purposes including one dietary supplement that have been shown to block or reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells.The study, published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses artificial intelligence-powered image analysis of human cell lines during infection with the novel coronavirus.The cells were treated with more than 1,400 individual FDA-approved drugs and compounds, either before or after viral infection, and screened, resulting in 17 potential hits. Ten of those hits were newly recognized, with seven identified in previous drug repurposing studies, including remdesivir, which is one of the few FDA-approved therapies for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Traditionally, the drug development process takes a decade and we just don t have a decade,  said Jonathan Sexton, Ph.D., assistant professor of Internal Medicine at the U-M Medical School and one of the senior authors on the paper.  The therapies we discovered are well positioned for phase 2 clinical trials because their safety has already been established. The team validated the 17 candidate compounds in several types of cells, including stem-cell derived human lung cells in an effort to mimic SARS-CoV2 infection of the respiratory tract. Nine showed anti-viral activity at reasonable doses, including lactoferrin, a protein found in human breastmilk that is also available over the counter as a dietary supplement derived from cow s milk. We found lactoferrin had remarkable efficacy for preventing infection, working better than anything else we observed,  Sexton said. He adds that early data suggest this efficacy extends even to newer variants of SARS-CoV2, including the highly transmissible Delta variant.The team is soon launching clinical trials of the compound to examine its ability to reduce viral loads and inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.  The trials are adding to the list of ongoing studies of promising repurposed drugs. Sexton noted that over the course of the pandemic, other drug repurposing studies have identified different compounds with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV2. The results seem to be dependent on what cell system is used,  he said.  But there is an emerging consensus around a subset of drugs and those are the ones that have the highest priority for clinical translation. We fully expect that the majority of these won t work in human beings, but we anticipate there are some that will. ","Published: August 23, 2021"

But estimates vary widely, making it hard to develop mitigation strategies. Two agricultural economists at the University of Illinois take a closer look at how choice of statistical methodology influences climate study results. They also propose a more accurate and place-specific approach to data analysis. If you pay attention to forecasts of how the climate will affect U.S. agriculture, the results are completely different. Some scientists predict it's going to have a positive impact for the nation in the long run, some report it's going to have a negative impact,  says study co-author Sandy Dall Erba, professor in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics (ACE) and director of the Center for Climate, Regional, Environmental and Trade Economics (CREATE) at U of I.Dall Erba and Chang Cai, doctoral student in ACE and the paper s lead author, take stock of all the academic literature that estimates the impact of climate change on U.S. farmland values and revenues, focusing on every U.S. county. The county-level scale is not only more accurate, the researchers say, but also important for regional policy makers, because they can make county-specific decisions in areas where climate change is anticipated to pose a serious challenge. There is not a single commodity that is produced all over the U.S. The only way we can really understand the relationship between climate and agriculture is that rather than focusing on a particular crop or livestock, we look at economic impacts,  Dall Erba notes.  Looking at aggregated agricultural outcomes allows us to compare the situation across every county in the U.S. The researchers look at how studies group locations for analysis, and how such groupings affect the results. Early studies would assume one additional degree of Celsius or Fahrenheit in Arizona will have the exact same marginal effect on agriculture as one additional degree in Illinois, which makes very little sense because you're looking on the one hand at a place that is quite used to high temperature and low precipitation, versus a place which is used to moderate temperature and much more precipitation,  Dall Erba says.Recently, studies have tried to differentiate results and estimate effects based on local conditions. A popular approach is to divide the U.S. into irrigated versus rainfed areas, roughly across a west/east partition along the 100th meridian. While Illinois and Arizona would thus belong to different groups, Arizona and Montana would still be expected to experience similar marginal effects of weather.Another method, which Dall Erba has used in his own research, compares low- versus high-elevation areas, while a third approach is to group locations along state lines. Dall Erba says researchers use the latter approach because it is straightforward to estimate and relevant for policy measures, but it does not produce very accurate results, since state lines rarely conform to atmospheric characteristics.While all these approaches have some merit, they also have shortcomings. We discovered that results really do differ in terms of what the future impact of climate change will be if you choose one grouping versus another, especially in primary agricultural areas,  Cai explains.  We also found out that none of those groupings is better than any other in predicting what the future outcome will be. Cai and Dall Erba recommend using one of three new statistical approaches that offer county-specific climate-impact estimates. All of these methods are driven by data and start without any assumptions on what the groups will look like. Instead, these methods analyze data to determine both the number of groups and who belongs to what group. These scientific techniques, called C-Lasso, causal forest algorithm, and geographically weighted regressions, have been used for analysis in other fields, such as the labor market and energy conservation, but they have not been used in climate change research before.  You really let the data speak for themselves; you do not impose anything on your model. As soon as you start making choices on how one should group the observations, you've already guided your results in one direction. And then you ll want to defend your choice. We re hoping future researchers will be more cautious about a priori choices,  Dall Erba explains.Dall Erba and Cai are already working on applying these new approaches to a comprehensive analysis of climate change and U.S. agricultural production. They expect to present their results in a forthcoming paper, and to guide the implementation of place-tailored climate change adaptation strategies.Reference: Cai C, Dall Erba S.

This depletion could have significance for global climate change and therefore, understanding this phenomenon is important.Now, a group of scientists led by Prof. Yoshizumi Miyoshi from Nagoya University, Japan, has observed, analyzed, and provided greater insight into this phenomenon. The findings are published in Nature s Scientific Reports.In the Earth s magnetosphere   the region of magnetic field around the Earth   electrons from the sun remain trapped. Interactions between electrons and plasma waves can cause the trapped electrons to escape and enter the Earth s upper atmosphere (thermosphere). This phenomenon, called electron precipitation, is responsible for aurorae. But, recent studies show that this is also responsible for local ozone layer depletions in the mesosphere (lower than thermosphere) and may have a certain impact on our climate.What s more, this ozone depletion at the mesosphere could be occurring specifically during aurorae. And while scientists have studied electron precipitation in relation to aurorae, none have been able to sufficiently elucidate how it causes mesospheric ozone depletion.Prof. Miyoshi and team took the opportunity to change this narrative during a moderate geomagnetic storm over the Scandinavian Peninsula in 2017. They aimed their observations at  pulsating aurorae  (PsA), a type of faint aurora. Their observations were possible through coordinated experiments with the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar (at an altitude between 60 and 120 km where the PsA occurs), the Japanese spacecraft Arase, and the all-sky camera network.Arase data showed that the trapped electrons in the Earth s magnetosphere have a wide energy range. It also indicated the presence of chorus waves, a type of electromagnetic plasma wave, in that region of space. Computer simulations then showed that Arase had observed plasma waves causing precipitations of these electrons across the wide energy range, which is consistent with EISCAT observations down in the Earth s thermosphere.Analysis of EISCAT data showed that electrons of a wide energy range, from a few keV (kilo electron volts) to MeV (mega electron volts), precipitate to cause PsA. These electrons carry enough energy to penetrate our atmosphere to lower than 100 km, up to an ~60 km altitude, where mesospheric ozone lies. In fact, computer simulations using EISCAT data showed that these electrons immediately deplete the local ozone in the mesosphere (by more than 10%) upon hitting it.Prof. Miyoshi explains,  PsAs occur almost daily, are spread over large areas, and last for hours. Therefore, the ozone depletion from these events could be significant.  Speaking of the greater significance of these findings, Prof. Miyoshi continues:  This is only a case study. Further statistical studies are needed to confirm how much ozone destruction occurs in the middle atmosphere because of electron precipitation. After all, the impact of this phenomenon on the climate could potentially impact modern life. Reference: Miyoshi Y, Hosokawa K, Kurita S, et al.

Many of the elderly patients who survived the virus were poor: not exactly the demographic you would expect to fare well in a health crisis.A review of the survivors  medical records revealed that a significant number suffered from chronic heartburn and were taking an inexpensive drug called famotidine, the key ingredient in Pepcid. (Wealthier patients tended to take the more costly drug omeprazole, found in Prilosec.)Was an over-the-counter acid suppressant helping people survive COVID-19?This is how many medical studies begin, said biomedical engineering professor Phil Bourne, who serves as founding dean for the School of Data Science.  There s often a phenomenon that doctors report anecdotally, or that s mentioned in passing in a particular research paper, and that provides a clue   a hook,  he said.Typically, to find out whether a drug is effective in treating a particular medical condition, scientists develop prospective clinical trials. But this method is expensive and can take years, Bourne pointed out. When faced with a global pandemic, it s helpful to explore other options.That s where data scientists come in. Bourne and UVA senior scientist Cameron Mura worked with an international team of researchers to analyze information from a database that holds the medical records of millions of COVID-19 patients living in 30 different countries. The team winnowed that number down to around 22,000 people, the largest sample size for a study on famotidine and the disease to date. The power of the electronic health record, which is really yet to be fully realized as a research tool, is that you ve suddenly got all this data you can mine to see whether what you determined in passing or anecdotally has any basis,  Bourne said.The team s analysis, which appeared in the journal Signal Transduction & Targeted Therapy (from the Nature publishing group), showed that the data supported findings from other smaller-scale studies. When delivered at high doses (the equivalent of about 10 Pepcid tablets), famotidine appears to improve the odds of survival for COVID-19 patients, especially when it is combined with aspirin. It also seems to hinder the severity of disease progression, making patients less likely to reach the point where they require intubation or a ventilator.The next challenge was to figure out why. Data scientists like Mura and Bourne perform extensive detective work for medical analyses like this one, looking at existing information and drawing upon biochemical and molecular principles to propose a cohesive theory that helps elucidate the population-scale patterns they identify. Mura calls this  weaving a story  based on the data. He needed to work backwards from massive groups of people and draw some possible conclusions about what was happening at a totally different scale   the scale of proteins that are  one millionth the size of an ant,  he said.One of the most dangerous phenomena COVID-19 can trigger in your body is something called a cytokine storm, which is a potentially fatal amplification of an immune response. When you become sick, your immune system releases inflammatory proteins called cytokines that tell your immune cells how to fight the infection. But in more severe illnesses, cytokine production can spiral out of control, becoming dysregulated.  Basically, your immune system goes haywire and starts attacking things like your otherwise healthy lung tissue because it s so desperate to kill off the invading virus,  Mura said.  Your own physiology essentially uses a sledgehammer against the pathogen when a fly swatter would suffice. The team s theory is that famotidine suppresses that reaction. Although it was developed with a specific purpose in mind   blocking the histamine receptors that help produce acid in your stomach   famotidine, like all other medications, can cause side effects. Mura and his colleagues believe that interfering with cytokine storms might be one of them. It may well be a case of famotidine having a beneficial off-target effect,  Mura said. We generally think of side effects as a bad thing, but in some cases, they can be harnessed to treat other conditions. In the future, it s possible that famotidine could be re-purposed in this way.But the team s findings are far from conclusive. Other studies have offered conflicting pictures of what famotidine can do for COVID-19 patients: Some have found that it has a neutral effect and one has even suggested that it might be detrimental. Mura, Bourne and their colleagues recently published a review of existing research on the subject, along with suggestions for a framework that could help reconcile the contradictory reports.Still, with its unique focus on combining famotidine with aspirin and its impressively large sample size, the team s study has shed further light on an inexpensive and safe potential treatment that would be easy for doctors to prescribe. In the midst of an international health crisis, the study has also laid important groundwork for further research.

However, producing this material requires an environmentally unfriendly process, the first step of which uses the endangered element zinc as a catalyst. Now, researchers have developed  greener  methods for this step that use alternative metals. They might even be able to substitute waste iron in the form of rust, or ferric oxide, for the endangered element. According to estimates from the ACS Green Chemistry Institute, zinc is only 50 to 100 years away from being extinct,  says Amina Aly, an undergraduate student who is presenting the work at the meeting.  And currently, manufacturers use zinc as the reducing agent and catalyst for making cyclohexene from trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane, which is the first step in the five-step synthesis of nylon 6-6. The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  Nylon  is a general term for a family of synthetic polymers, called polyamides, that are made of repeating units. Different types of nylons, such as nylon 6 and nylon 6-6, use different building blocks and therefore have unique properties. Nylon 6-6 is so named because it s composed of two molecules, each having six carbon atoms, that are linked together as the repeating unit. To find a substitute for zinc, Aly, who is in the lab of Brian Agee, Ph.D., at Augusta University, looked to other metals that were nearby in the periodic table and had similar chemical properties. Other criteria were that the metals needed to be more abundant than zinc and safe to work with. The team chose to study cobalt, aluminum, iron, copper and nickel as possible catalysts in the production of cyclohexene. In addition, the researchers wanted to identify greener methods that save energy and water, while using less harsh chemicals. So, they incorporated a solar reflective dish instead of an electric hot plate and a water-saving condenser in place of a regular condenser. Also, the team swapped propylene glycol for the more hazardous ethylene glycol as the heat-transfer agent in the water-saving condenser, which cools the reaction without needing a continuous flow of cold water like regular condensers. Aly found that iron was the best catalyst tested so far, with only slightly lower yields than zinc.  We also found that solar energy really is the way to go when it comes to this synthesis because the sun is a lot stronger than any hot plate you re going to find, and a lot faster,  she says. Conducting the synthesis outside with a solar reflector required only 30 minutes, compared with 3 -4 hours in the lab using a hot plate. The researchers also found that increasing the time of reflux   heating the reaction for a specific amount of time and using a condenser to continuously cool the produced vapors to convert them back into liquid form   from 15 minutes to 30 minutes substantially increased the yield.  Since we re using the radiant energy of the sun, we re not wasting electricity with extra heating,  Agee notes. The researchers say their methods could be easily scaled up for industrial nylon 6-6 manufacturing. Although iron is an abundant metal, Aly and Agee want to try catalyzing the reaction with an even more environmentally friendly iron waste product that can be found anywhere metal is left outside to get wet: ferric oxide, or rust.  If ferric oxide purchased from a chemical company works for the reaction, I m seriously considering going to my parents  place and scraping a little rust off their barn to try,  Agee says.  Because as a green chemist, what better source for a catalyst than something you can get anywhere? ReferencePresented at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society, Aug. 22-26 2021.

It s an ability acquired only after insemination, during passage through the female reproductive tract, and requires two consecutive, time-sensitive processes to provide sperm with the physical and biochemical traits necessary to complete their fundamental job.The first process is called capacitation, which alters the physiology of each spermatozoa, changing the membrane of the head to help it penetrate the hard, outer layer of an egg   the zona pellucida   and chemistry in the tail to generate greater motility, the ability to move and swim. The second process is acrosome reaction (AR), a chemical action that involves releasing enzymes in the spermatozoa s head that further boost penetration of the zona pellucida.Both processes are essential to successful fertilization of an egg, and AR is time-dependent: It cannot take place too early or too late. Indeed, premature AR has been associated with idiopathic (spontaneous) male infertility. Neither process, however, is well understood in terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. In a new paper, publishing August 19, 2021 in the journal eLife, a team of researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine detail how GIV/Girdin, a ubiquitous signaling molecule plays a critical role in male fertility, orchestrating capacitation and AR to promote sperm motility, survival and fertilization success. Specifically, the research team, led by senior author Pradipta Ghosh, MD, professor in the departments of Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine, found that GIV a member of the G protein family that serve as molecular switches inside cells, transmitting and fine-tuning signals regulates the activity of enzymes that turn on and turn off the processes of capacitation and AR. The findings demonstrate how GIV orchestrates distinct signaling programs in sperm that separated by space and time, effectively supporting capacitation while inhibiting premature AR,  said Ghosh.  As a result, GIV plays an essential role in male fertility. Infertility affects an estimated 8 to 12 percent of couples globally, with males being a primary or contributing factor in roughly half of all cases, according to published studies. Causes of male infertility are multiple, but roughly 25 percent involve either sperm transport disorders or idiopathic factors in sperm with no apparent dysfunction. GIV is required for male fertility, and low levels of GIV transcripts in men is invariably associated with infertility,  said Ghosh.  We ve found evidence that GIV may perform different roles in the capacitation of sperm, findings that shed new light on both how defective GIV-signaling might be used as a potential marker for male infertility and how inhibitors of GIV-dependent signaling inhibit fertility by reducing sperm motility and viability and by promoting premature acrosome reaction.  The latter, ironically enough, may be a promising strategy for development of a male contraceptive pill specifically targeting sperm.""Reference: Reynoso S, Castillo V, Katkar GD, et al.

Although GBS infections can often be treated or prevented with antibiotics, the bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant. Now, researchers have discovered that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)   short strings of sugar molecules abundant in breast milk   can help prevent GBS infections in human cells and tissues and in mice. Someday, HMOs might be able to replace antibiotics for treating infections in infants and adults, they say.The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2021 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 22-26, and on-demand content will be available Aug. 30-Sept. 30. The meeting features more than 7,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  Our lab has previously shown that mixtures of HMOs isolated from the milk of several different donor mothers have antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against GBS,  says Rebecca Moore, who is presenting the work at the meeting.  We wanted to jump from these in vitro studies to see whether HMOs could prevent infections in cells and tissues from a pregnant woman, and in pregnant mice.  Moore is a graduate student in the labs of Steven Townsend, Ph.D., at Vanderbilt University and Jennifer Gaddy, Ph.D., at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 2,000 babies in the U.S. get GBS each year, and 4-6% of them die from it. The bacteria are often transferred from mother to baby during labor and delivery. An expectant mother who tests positive for GBS is usually given intravenous antibiotics during labor to help prevent early-onset infections, which occur during the first week of life. Interestingly, the incidence of late-onset infections (which happen from one week to three months after birth) is higher in formula-fed than breastfed infants, which suggests that factors in breast milk could help protect against GBS. If so, the sugars could perhaps replace antibiotics, which, in addition to killing beneficial bacteria, are becoming less effective because of the rise in antibiotic resistance. The researchers studied the effects of combined HMOs from several mothers on GBS infection of placental immune cells (called macrophages) and of the gestational membrane (the sac surrounding the fetus).  We found that HMOs were able to completely inhibit bacterial growth in both the macrophages and the membranes, so we very quickly turned to looking at a mouse model,  Moore says. They examined whether HMOs could prevent a GBS infection from spreading through the reproductive tract of pregnant mice.  In five different parts of the reproductive tract, we saw significantly decreased GBS infection with HMO treatment,  Moore notes. To figure out which HMOs and other oligosaccharides have these antimicrobial effects and why, the researchers set up an artificial two-species microbiome with GBS and the beneficial Streptococcus salivarius species growing in a tissue culture plate, separated by a semi-permeable membrane. Then, the researchers added oligosaccharides that are commonly added to infant formula, called galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), which are derived from plants. In the absence of the sugar, GBS suppressed the growth of the  good  bacteria, but GOS helped this beneficial species grow.  We concluded that GBS is producing lactic acid that inhibits growth, and then when we add the oligosaccharide, the beneficial species can use it as a food source to overcome this suppression,  Moore explains. Somewhat surprisingly, the first HMOs they ve tested in the system did not have this effect, but Townsend says it s likely that one or more of the over 200 unique sugars in human milk will show activity in the artificial microbiome assay. The team plans to find out. The reason HMOs can treat and prevent GBS infection is likely two-fold, the researchers say: They act as an anti-adhesive by preventing pathogens from sticking to tissue surfaces and forming a biofilm, and they could act as a prebiotic by supporting the growth of good bacteria.  HMOs have been around as long as humans have, and bacteria have not figured them out. Presumably, that s because there are so many in milk, and they re constantly changing during a baby s development,  Townsend says.  But if we could learn more about how they work, it s possible that we could treat different types of infections with mixtures of HMOs, and maybe one day this could be a substitute for antibiotics in adults, as well as babies.

The test approach, called DELFI (DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception), spots unique patterns in the fragmentation of DNA shed from cancer cells circulating in the bloodstream. Applying this technology to blood samples taken from 796 individuals in Denmark, the Netherlands and the U.S., investigators found that the DELFI approach accurately distinguished between patients with and without lung cancer.Combining the test with analysis of clinical risk factors, a protein biomarker, and followed by computed tomography imaging, DELFI helped detect 94% of patients with cancer across stages and subtypes. This included 91% of patients with earlier or less invasive stage I/II cancers and 96% of patients with more advanced stage III/IV cancers. These results will be published in the August 20 issue of the journal Nature Communications.Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death, claiming almost 2 million lives worldwide each year. However, fewer than 6% of Americans at risk for lung cancers undergo recommended low-dose computed tomography screening, despite projections that tens of thousands of deaths could be avoided, and even fewer are screened worldwide, explains senior study author Victor E. Velculescu, M.D., Ph.D., professor of oncology and do-director of the Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics Program at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. This is due to a variety of reasons, including concerns of potential harm from investigation of false positive imaging results, radiation exposure or worries about complications from invasive procedures.  It is clear that there is an urgent, unmet clinical need for development of alternative, noninvasive approaches to improve cancer screening for high-risk individuals and, ultimately, the general population,  says lead author Dimitrios Mathios, a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.  We believe that a blood test, or  liquid biopsy,  for lung cancer could be a good way to enhance screening efforts, because it would be easy to do, broadly accessible and cost-effective. The DELFI technology uses a blood test to indirectly measure the way DNA is packaged inside the nucleus of a cell by studying the size and amount of cell-free DNA present in the circulation from different regions across the genome. Healthy cells package DNA like a well-organized suitcase, in which different regions of the genome are placed carefully in various compartments. The nuclei of cancer cells, by contrast, are like more disorganized suitcases, with items from across the genome thrown in haphazardly. When cancer cells die, they release DNA in a chaotic manner into the bloodstream. DELFI helps identify the presence of cancer using machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to examine millions of cell-free DNA fragments for abnormal patterns, including the size and amount of DNA in different genomic regions. This approach provides a view of cell-free DNA referred to as the  fragmentome.  The DELFI approach only requires low-coverage sequencing of the genome, enabling this technology to be cost-effective in a screening setting, the researchers say.For the study, investigators from Johns Hopkins, working with researchers in Denmark and the Netherlands, first performed genome sequencing of cell-free DNA in blood samples from 365 individuals participating in a seven-year Danish study called LUCAS. The majority of participants were at high risk for lung cancer and had smoking-related symptoms such as cough or difficulty breathing. The DELFI approach found that patients who were later determined to have cancer had widespread variation in their fragmentome profiles, while patients found not to have cancer had consistent fragmentome profiles. Subsequently, researchers validated the DELFI technology using a different population of 385 individuals without cancer and 46 individuals with cancer.  Overall, the approach detected over 90% of patients with lung cancer, including those with early and advanced stages, and with different subtypes.  DNA fragmentation patterns provide a remarkable fingerprint for early detection of cancer that we believe could be the basis of a widely available liquid biopsy test for patients with lung cancer,  says author Rob Scharpf, Ph.D., associate professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.   A first-of-a-kind national clinical trial called DELFI-L101, sponsored by the Johns Hopkins University spin-out Delfi Diagnostics, is evaluating a test based on the DELFI technology in 1,700 participants in the U.S., including healthy participants, individuals with lung cancers and individuals with other cancers. The group would like to further study DELFI in other types of cancers.Reference: Mathios D, Johansen JS, Cristiano S, et al.

But parent genes that aren t directly inherited, yet have still shaped parents  own education levels and subsequently influenced the lifestyle and family environment they provide for their children, are also important and can affect how well a person does at school and beyond.The study, a systematic review and meta-analysis of prior evidence of genetic impacts on educational outcomes, is published today in the American Journal of Human Genetics.Children resemble their parents because of nature (the genes they inherit) and nurture (the environment they grow up in). But nature and nurture effects are intertwined.Mothers and fathers each pass on half of their genes to their children, and although the other half of their genes are not passed on, they continue to influence the parents  traits and ultimately influence the traits in their children. For example, parents with a higher genetic propensity for learning may have a greater interest in activities such as reading that, in turn, nurture learning in their offspring.This concept   when parents  genes influence outcomes for their offspring by shaping the environment that they provide for them   is called genetic nurture. It describes how parents  genes indirectly their children s characteristics.For the current paper, researchers reviewed and analysed 12 studies in several countries and used a method called polygenic scoring to study the influence of millions of genetic variants on educational attainment in nearly 40,000 parent and child pairs.The researchers found that genetic nurture had about half as much impact on education success as genetic inheritance.Genetic nurture effects captured by polygenic scores in the studies explained at least 1.28% of variance in educational outcomes, while direct genetic effects explained at least 2.89% of variance in educational outcomes. The researchers say the findings are underestimated given that polygenic scores only capture a fraction of heritability in educational outcomes; the actual genetic effects could be multiple times higher, but direct genetic effects would probably still be roughly double those of genetic nurture effects.Lead researcher Dr Jean-Baptiste Pingault (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences) said:  We discovered genetic nurture has a significant effect on a child s educational achievement. The effects were mainly down to their parents  education and how it influences the environment they provide. We also found that fathers and mothers had similar genetic nurture effects, suggesting both parents are equally important in shaping and fostering an environment favourable for a child s learning. This study illustrates how complex the relationship between genes and the environment is. Although our study uses genetic methods, it provides strong evidence that, as well as genetics, the environment really matters when we talk about education. Two aspects are complementary here. First, some of it depends on the genetic lottery, so parents do not have complete control and not everything is down to what they do. That said, what parents do and their choices do seem to matter. Our findings show that socioeconomic status and parental education are probably key. It is really important to understand how educational attainment (years of education, highest degree obtained) and achievement (scores and grades achieved) are passed on through families, and how this knowledge could help us break cycles of disadvantage across generations. First author of the paper, Dr Biyao Wang (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences) said:  It is too early yet to say whether the most important is what happens within the family (such as parents reading to their children) or outside the family (such as parents choosing the best school and activities). Next we hope to work out which pathways genetic nurture operates through, if it changes during different stages of development, and identify what aspects of the environment are most important. This will be key to designing new interventions to encourage and support all children to succeed. Reference: Wang B, Baldwin JR, Schoeler T, et al.

Many of the variants circulating now are partially resistant to some of the antibody-based therapeutics that were developed based on the original virus. As the pandemic continues, more variants inevitably will arise, and the problem of resistance will only grow.Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified an antibody that is highly protective at low doses against a wide range of viral variants. Moreover, the antibody attaches to a part of the virus that differs little across the variants, meaning that it is unlikely for resistance to arise at this spot. The findings, available online in the journal Immunity, could be a step toward developing new antibody-based therapies that are less likely to lose their potency as the virus mutates.  Current antibodies may work against some but not all variants,  said senior author Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine.  The virus will likely continue to evolve over time and space. Having broadly neutralizing, effective antibodies that work individually and can be paired to make new combinations will likely prevent resistance.  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, uses a protein called spike to attach to and invade cells in the body s respiratory tract. Antibodies that prevent spike from attaching to cells neutralize the virus and prevent disease. Many variants have acquired mutations in their spike genes that allow them to evade some antibodies generated against the original strain, undermining the effectiveness of antibody-based therapeutics. To find neutralizing antibodies that work against a wide range of variants, the researchers began by immunizing mice with a key part of the spike protein known as the receptor-binding domain. Then, they extracted antibody-producing cells and obtained 43 antibodies from them that recognize the receptor-binding domain. Along with Diamond, the research team included co-first authors Laura VanBlargan, PhD, a staff scientist; Lucas J. Adams, an MD/PhD student; and Zhuoming Liu, PhD, a staff scientist; as well as co-author Daved Fremont, PhD, a professor of pathology & immunology, of biochemistry & molecular biophysics and of molecular microbiology. The researchers screened the 43 antibodies by measuring how well they prevented the original variant of SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells in a dish. Nine of the most potent neutralizing antibodies were then tested in mice to see whether they could protect animals infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 from disease. Multiple antibodies passed both tests, with varying degrees of potency. The researchers selected the two antibodies that were most effective at protecting mice from disease and tested them against a panel of viral variants. The panel comprised viruses with spike proteins representing all four variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma and delta), two variants of interest (kappa and iota), and several unnamed variants that are being monitored as potential threats. One antibody, SARS2-38, easily neutralized all the variants. Moreover, a humanized version of SARS2-38 protected mice against disease caused by two variants: kappa and a virus containing the spike protein from the beta variant. The beta variant is notoriously resistant to antibodies, so its inability to resist SARS2-38 is particularly remarkable, the researchers noted. Further experiments pinpointed the precise spot on the spike protein recognized by the antibody, and identified two mutations at that spot that could, in principle, prevent the antibody from working. These mutations are vanishingly rare in the real world, however. The researchers searched a database of nearly 800,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and found escape mutations in only 0.04% of them.  This antibody is both highly neutralizing (meaning it works very well at low concentrations) and broadly neutralizing (meaning it works against all variants),  said Diamond, who is also a professor of molecular microbiology and of pathology & immunology.  That s an unusual and very desirable combination for an antibody. Also, it binds to a unique spot on the spike protein that isn t targeted by other antibodies under development. That s great for combination therapy. We could start thinking about combining this antibody with another one that binds somewhere else to create a combination therapy that would be very difficult for the virus to resist.

These structures generate energy and help to keep the cells' interior environment in a state of healthy equilibrium, among other functions.Now, scientists show how a protein associated with Parkinson's disease can damage these cellular powerhouses.The findings come from experiments in which fruit fly larvae were genetically engineered to produce unusually high amounts of the protein, called alpha-synuclein.""When fruit fly larvae expressed alpha-synuclein at elevated levels similar to what is seen in Parkinson's disease, many of the mitochondria we observed became unhealthy, and many became fragmented. Through detailed experiments, we also showed that different parts of the alpha-synuclein protein seem to be responsible for these two problems, and that fragmented mitochondria can actually be healthy. This is a key finding, because before, people thought fragmented mitochondria were unhealthy mitochondria,"" says Shermali Gunawardena, PhD, associate professor of biological sciences in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences.The results could be of interest in the context of drug development, as abnormal aggregates of alpha-synuclein in brain cells are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease, and mitochondrial damage has also been observed in patients.""This research showcases the advantage of using fruit fly larvae as a model organism to study how neurons become damaged during devastating diseases such as Parkinson's disease,"" says TJ Krzystek, UB PhD candidate in biological sciences. ""Through this approach, we pieced together a new understanding for how the Parkinson's disease-related protein alpha-synuclein disrupts the health and movement of mitochondria -- the epicenter for energy production in cells. We believe this work emphasizes a promising path that can be explored for potential therapeutics aimed at improving mitochondrial health in Parkinson's disease patients.""The study was published on Aug. 17 in the journal Cell Death and Disease.The co-first authors are Krzystek and Rupkatha Banerjee, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate at Scripps Research who completed her doctorate in biological sciences at UB.

Falzone at the Universidad de Buenos Aires and Instituto de Investigaci n en Biomedicina de Buenos Aires.A detailed look at alpha-synuclein and mitochondriaThrough tests in fruit fly larvae, the scientists were able to tease out intricate details regarding interactions between alpha-synuclein and mitochondria.For example, the study not only concludes that different sections of the alpha-synuclein protein are likely responsible for causing mitochondrial fragmentation and damaging mitochondrial health; the research also identifies these sections and describes how other proteins may interact with them to drive these changes. More specifically, the proteins PINK1 and Parkin -- both linked to Parkinson's disease -- may interact with one end of alpha-synuclein to influence mitochondrial health, while a protein called DRP1 may interact with the other end to break mitochondria, scientists say.""Mitochondrial impairments have long been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease,"" Banerjee says. ""However, the role of alpha-synuclein in mitochondrial quality control so far has not been comprehensively investigated. Our study unravels the intricate molecular mechanisms by which the different regions of alpha-synuclein exert distinct effects on mitochondrial health, bringing into light a potential pathway that could be targeted for exploring new therapeutic interventions in Parkinson's disease.""""We were able to tease out specific mechanistic functions for alpha synuclein by using imaging tools and a color-tagged marking system to observe the process of what happens to mitochondria when alpha-synuclein is elevated,"" Gunawardena adds.

The biggest advantage of SPM over conventional microscopy is that physical and chemical conditions can be acquired rapidly and as a high-resolution image.In this study, SPMs evaluated a vascular model (vasculature-on-a-chip) by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Using these SPMs, the researchers quantified the permeability and topographical information of the vasculature-on-a-chip.""MPS shows potential to recapitulate the physiology and functions of their counterparts in the human body. Most research on this topic has focused on the construction of biomimetic organ models. Today, there is an increasing interest in developing sensing systems for MPS"" said first author Yuji Nashimoto.Some have touted electrochemical sensors to monitor MPS. However, most electrochemical sensors cannot acquire the spatial information of cell functions in MPS because they have only one sensor per one analyte. In contrast, SPM provides spatial information about cell functions rapidly.""Our research group has developed various electrochemical imaging tools, SPMs and electrochemical arrays,"" explained corresponding author Hitoshi Shiku.""These devices will help usher in next-generation sensors in MPS.""Reference: Nashimoto Y, Abe M, Fujii R, et al.

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs   long, medical-grade probes used to collect samples from deep in patients  noses and throats   are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. However, memory of shortages of both the specialized NP swabs during the early days of the pandemic as well as pressure on the trained medical personnel needed to perform the tests point to the need for simpler COVID-19 testing.In a real-world trial, a team of clinician-researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) have demonstrated that tests of self-collected saliva provided comparable results to tests performed by trained healthcare professionals using NP swabs. The researchers concluded that saliva tests detect 93 percent of COVID-19 infections in an outpatient setting. The findings, which are published in the journal Microbiology Spectrum, could help alleviate the testing bottlenecks that have constrained COVID-19 testing since early in the pandemic. Saliva self-collection is simply easier and more comfortable than the alternative of NP swabs, which in addition to the discomfort also require a trained medical professional,  said corresponding author Ramy Arnaout, MD, DPhil, associate director of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories at BIDMC.  In addition to it being a more convenient method, our findings show saliva collection can also be just as effective even in a real-world scenario in which there are no eating or drinking restrictions before the saliva is collected. Arnaout and colleagues obtained two samples   one via NP swab, the other saliva   from 385 patients presenting for COVID-19 testing at BIDMC. Patients waiting in line for NP testing were given a sterile sample collection cup and asked to provide a three milliliter saliva sample. Saliva samples were processed either untreated or treated with a preservative, and all samples were tested across two different COVID-19 testing platforms.After finding that virus particles remained stable in both treated and untreated saliva samples for at least 24 hours, the researchers demonstrated high concordance, or agreement, between saliva testing and NP testing. That is, results came back the same in 93 percent of cases. Among the 385 samples taken, just nine had mismatched results between the NP and saliva test results. Most of the mismatches were at very low viral loads, making them clinically less worrisome, and saliva detected as many infections that NP missed, as vice versa.Arnaout and colleagues reported that the sensitivity of NP testing was still slightly higher than that of saliva testing, with NP testing able detect viral particles at lower concentrations. However, the researchers found that saliva testing is still likely to detect 90 percent of COVID-19 infections, and concluded that the minor loss in sensitivity is outweighed by the ease and safety of self-collection. We have demonstrated that for practical purposes, saliva is comparable to NP swabs for COVID-19 testing in outpatient settings,  said Arnaout, who is also associate professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School.The study results were announced in tandem with a first-person retrospective and analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology in which Arnaout details the collaborative and open-source effort he coordinated to address the shortage of swabs that hampered the nation s ability to test for and track the spread of COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic, and details the lessons learned. The team s earlier effort to catalyze the development of novel NP swab designs that could be manufactured quickly and in large numbers resulted in four 3D-printed prototypes that were validated in clinical testing. The four swab prototypes were selected from among more than 100 swab designs made of 45 different materials submitted by 23 companies, laboratories and individuals across the country for BIDMC s evaluation.Reference: Callahan C, Ditelberg S, Dutta S, et al.

Scientific statements represent the synthesis of data and a consensus of the leading experts, designed to address gaps in guidelines.This is the first American Heart Association scientific statement providing guidance specifically about genetic testing of cardiovascular diseases in children. In addition to previous statements issued by the Association on genetic testing mostly focused on adults, it was important to issue a pediatric-focused statement with the recognition that children and their families face unique challenges specific to pediatric gene testing, according to the statement writing group. There is growing recognition that a genetic test is not a simple blood test where you get a yes or no answer. With this statement, we illustrate some of that complexity, particularly as it relates to cardiovascular diseases passed from parents to children,  said Andrew P. Landstrom, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, chair of the statement writing group, a pediatric cardiologist, a cardiovascular geneticist and an assistant professor of pediatrics and cell biology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.  We provide consensus-based recommendations for best practices and principles to assist health care professionals in determining when cardiovascular gene testing is appropriate in children, highlighting the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to family counseling before and after testing, and we raise the importance of appropriate follow-up. The statement writing group noted that pre-test counseling is essential in genetic testing of children. Before a decision is made about genetic testing, counseling should be held with the parents and with the child, if the child is old enough to fully comprehend and able to contribute to the decisions. Counseling should cover the possible benefits of genetic testing and the limits of the test s ability to help with diagnosis and management, along with the possible outcomes of testing, including the potential impact on care. Pre-test counseling should address the possibility that the genetic results may be inconclusive since there is still much to be discovered about the genetic components of many diseases of the heart. Clinicians must collaborate with the family to be prepared for all scenarios, before testing is conducted   including a positive genetic test, a negative test or whether the test is inconclusive.Pre-test counseling is also the time to address family concerns about possible medical costs or the possibility that genetic test results could lead to discrimination or an inability to obtain health insurance in the future. The statement details federal laws families should know about that can help to alleviate some of these concerns.Post-test counseling and follow-up are also essential, according to the statement. After genetic test results are in, post-test counseling can be a time to explain the findings and plan how the information can be used in caring for the person affected, as well as proceeding with testing or treatment for other members of the family. Ongoing follow-up, possibly over the course of a lifetime, is also important because, in the rapidly evolving field of genetics, the understanding of a specific gene s significance may change over time. It s important to understand what s ahead before you start the process. In a disease such as long QT syndrome (a disorder of the heart s electrical system) or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (an inherited arrhythmia) genetic testing can identify a likely cause of the disease 60%-75% of the time. This means if it s suspected that an individual has one of these diseases, the test is likely to find the gene variant that causes the disease about two-thirds of the time. Identification of the presence or absence of this gene variant in family members of the individual can identify those who are, or are not, at risk of developing the same disease. In this situation, gene testing makes sense in most scenarios,  Landstrom said.  With some inherited cardiovascular diseases, the genetic causes are not well known and the likelihood of finding the gene causing the condition is much lower in pediatric testing. For these diseases, the likelihood of finding one of these genetic variants of uncertain significance can make the test challenging to interpret. These are important considerations for clinicians and families to understand and discuss together before testing is done. The writing group advises that as genetic testing becomes more readily available, it s important that it be used appropriately. Clinicians should first determine or have a strong sense of a clinical diagnosis   the genetic testing can help refine the diagnosis and, in some cases, can help define the next of many possible steps in disease management.Two main types of cardiovascular gene testing are provided to children   diagnostic and risk-predicting.If, after a thorough cardiology workup, a child is strongly suspected of having a hereditary heart condition, a diagnostic genetic test may be ordered to determine whether the child has the gene variation known to be associated with that condition. A diagnostic gene test can refine the clinical diagnosis and help with decisions about how best to manage the condition in some cases, such as choosing a medication or recommending lifestyle changes that can improve the likelihood of the person staying healthy.The second type of testing, called risk-predictive testing, is done on a close relative, such as a sibling, parent or a child of the person found to have a genetic variant associated with a heart condition. If a relative is found to have the same gene variant that was determined to be the likely cause of disease in an affected family member, the relative may be at-risk for developing the same condition. This doesn t mean they are guaranteed to develop the condition in the same way, or even that they will get the condition at all, just that they are  at-risk , and they will need to be closely monitored because of this increased risk,  Landstrom said.  Conversely, if the gene variant causing the condition in the family is identified and a relative tested doesn t have that genetic variant, that person likely does not need additional follow-up or screening beyond that of the general population. The statement also addresses gene-sequencing, another type of gene testing gaining momentum in recent years, which involves testing children in whom there is no suspicion for cardiac disease but may alternatively identify another genetic syndrome. As genetic sequencing has gotten easier and less expensive, it is more available to clinicians, and more of it is being done. That convergence of technology and clinical availability of genetic tests makes it important to provide guidance to be clear on the rationale for ordering a genetic test and ensuring tests are not ordered inappropriately or just because they are available.Prior to initiating genetic testing, practitioners should consider referring a child with a suspected heritable cardiovascular disease to a multidisciplinary cardiovascular genetics program. Multidisciplinary teams typically include close collaboration among adult and pediatric cardiologists, genetic counselors, geneticists, behavioral health specialists and others as appropriate for a case. While these programs are usually found at large medical centers, improved telehealth capability has made access easier. Pediatric genetic testing has important considerations beyond those of adult testing, including the vulnerability of children as a population, and these considerations should be at the forefront of all decision-making about genetic testing,  Landstrom said.  Other considerations include the dynamics within the child s family, the family s goals and concerns, potential psychosocial effects of testing (or not testing) and the current state of genetic testing methods. Additional factors to help inform the decision-making process to ensure the best outcomes for children and family members are the characteristics of the specific heritable cardiovascular disease, the likelihood and timing of disease development, the availability of therapies and interventions that can treat or prevent disease, and the availability and cost of testing.

Alterations to daily lifestyles due to the current stressful routines people follow disrupt the body s day-night cycle for longer periods. Recent studies in rats have shown that even chronic light exposure can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause memory deficits seen in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer s disease (AD). Interestingly, circadian rhythm disruption has also been frequently reported in patients suffering from AD. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between AD and circadian rhythm disruption remains unclear.To understand the correlation between circadian rhythm disturbances and AD progression, a team of researchers from Shoolini University, India, tested the effect of circadian rhythm disruption caused by chronic light exposure on the physiology and functional abilities of Wistar rats. Explaining the rationale behind their study published in ACS Chemical Neuroscience (American Chemical Society), Professor Rohit Goyal, who led the study, said,  Cells of various organs in the body are synchronized to the day-night cycle, and release different biochemical substances including hormones in a time-specific manner. Untimely expression of these hormones can trigger anxiety, cognitive impairment, and memory loss, all symptoms of brain disorders such as AD. In a previous study, the team had reported that upon chronic light exposure for two months, rats exhibit cognitive deficits along with sub-clinical accumulation of amyloid   (A ), the pathogenic protein known to form aggregates in AD. Building on these findings, they speculated that longer light exposure may result in circadian rhythm disruptions that cause an AD-like phenotype. To test this hypothesis, they exposed adult rats to constant light conditions for four months and compared them with rats subjected to a normal light-dark cycle taken as the control group.They found that chronic light exposure disrupted the expression of genes like Per2 that follow circadian rhythms. Markers of oxidative stress such as peroxiredoxins were also dysregulated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) region of the brain in these rats, which is the primary controller of circadian rhythms in the body. Neurotransmitters, including glutamate and  -aminobutyric acid, were dysregulated in the SCN of rats with circadian rhythm disruption due to chronic light exposure. Additionally, these animals showed disrupted metabolic profiles, suggestive that their digestive systems may also have been adversely affected by the disrupted circadian rhythms.The level of soluble A  in the brain was also significantly higher in these rats compared to the controls, and they experienced down-regulation of anti-aging gene Sirt1 and up-regulation of the neuronal damage markers. The researchers also found that circadian rhythm disruption due to chronic light exposure caused memory and cognitive deficits in the rats. Collectively, these findings were suggestive of an AD-like phenotype.Based on the above results, their next hypothesis was that fluoxetine, a drug used for treating anxiety and hyperactivity, could alleviate physiological and functional abnormalities associated with circadian rhythm disruption. Sure enough, fluoxetine treatment prevented oxidative damage, A  accumulation, and rescued memory and cognitive deficits in the treated rats.Overall, the study suggests that long-term circadian rhythm disruption induces AD-like pathology in rats, which can be prevented by treatment with fluoxetine. Notably, elevation in A , a hallmark of AD, and disturbed circadian rhythms, can each trigger the other, resulting in a cascade of irreversible neurological symptoms. This sets the stage for serious life-long conditions like AD.The clinical implications of their findings are also evident. Prof. Goyal remarks,  Lifestyle changes that support exposure to natural light followed by ample rest at night may thus be key to limiting the risk of neurological disorders. Therapeutic strategies to optimize circadian timing in prospective patients hold great promise to restrain the prevalence of AD . Better lifestyle practices, following the traditional Indian discipline of Yoga, or maintaining a natural day-night cycle for work schedules and even dietary practices may make our bodies healthier and function better.This study certainly  sheds light  on the cause-and-effect relationship between circadian rhythms and AD progression, paving the way for future investigations on this important topic.Reference: Sharma A, Mohammad A, Saini AK, Goyal R.

The organization issued an official statement today at NCCN.org/covid-19 calling on all healthcare systems to ensure their workforces are immunized, which includes the following perspective: Patients with cancer are more susceptible to COVID-19 complications and may not mount effective immune responses to vaccination, so it is incumbent on healthcare workers to be immunized against COVID-19. In so doing, we help to create a cocoon effect in which vulnerable individuals are protected from COVID-19 by vaccinating those who care for these patients. Cancer care providers have a responsibility to their patients and colleagues to do everything they can to reduce the spread of COVID-19; that includes getting vaccinated,  said Robert W. Carlson, MD, Chief Executive Officer, NCCN.  We know cancer patients already face a higher risk from COVID-19 and must be protected during their many interactions with healthcare workers. According to the science, vaccines are our best option to safely protect ourselves and the people around us from this potentially deadly disease. NCCN s endorsement of mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers stems from the work of the NCCN COVID-19 Vaccination Advisory Committee, a group of leading physicians with expertise in infectious diseases, vaccine development and delivery, cancer management, and medical ethics. The committee has previously shared evidence-based expert consensus recommendations on vaccinating people with cancer against COVID-19. They regularly update this guidance which is intended for clinicians and also available in a patient-friendly format. We re deeply committed to doing everything to protect our patients from COVID-19,  said Brahm Segal, MD, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Co-Leader of the NCCN COVID-19 Vaccination Advisory Committee.  Our patients come to our centers for high quality and cutting-edge cancer care. We must insist they are protected as much as possible from COVID-19 during medical visits, and this requires that our workforce be immunized.

Symptoms of cognitive impairment vary among individuals, but often include slow information processing speed and inefficient learning and memory. Such deficits can be extremely disruptive to everyday life, affecting a person s ability to manage their disease, complete commonplace errands, and maintain employment. Unfortunately, there is no gold-standard treatment for MS-related cognitive impairment, as medications approved to treat MS have shown limited efficacy in treating cognitive dysfunction.One promising treatment approach is cognitive rehabilitation, in which behavioral interventions are used to improve cognition. There are two general approaches to cognitive rehabilitation: restorative and compensatory. Restorative cognitive rehabilitation (also known as cognitive remediation) aims to reinforce, strengthen, and recover cognitive skills, typically through repetitive cognitive exercises using computer-assisted paradigms. In contrast, compensatory cognitive rehabilitation does not aim to restore lost cognitive skills. Rather, it helps patients compensate for their cognitive difficulties using various strategies such as visualization and reminders.In their review, the Kessler team summarized the current state of cognitive rehabilitation research, both restorative and compensatory, among people with MS. Based on available evidence, they suggest that cognitive rehabilitation is an effective approach to improving MS-related cognitive impairment, as demonstrated by 81 published studies, most of which were published since 2011. Cognitive rehabilitation should be part of a comprehensive treatment plan for people with MS who experience cognitive deficits,  said co-author Dr. DeLuca, Senior Vice President for Research and Training at Kessler Foundation.  Given the lack of approved pharmacological treatments, behavioral approaches are the best treatment options that clinicians can currently offer,  he stressed.  Patients generally report enjoying treatment, which would be conducive to compliance. Furthermore, computer-based treatments can be easily delivered at home, making this low-cost effective intervention more convenient and accessible to individuals in need.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/sustainable-agriculture-meets-sanitation-technology-352375,Sustainable Agriculture Meets Sanitation Technology According to research  countries could be moving closer to using human waste as fertilizer  closing the loop to more circular  sustainable economies   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The future connection between human waste, sanitation technology and sustainable agriculture is becoming more evident. According to research directed by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign civil and environmental engineering professor Jeremy Guest, countries could be moving closer to using human waste as fertilizer, closing the loop to more circular, sustainable economies.A new study characterizes the spatial distribution of human urine-derived nutrients   nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium   and agricultural fertilizer demand to define supply-demand location typologies, their prevalence across the globe and the implications for resource recovery. The findings are published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The total amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium largely remains constant in our bodies, once we stop growing,  said Guest, who also serves as the acting associate director for research at the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment at the U. of I.  Whatever comes in through food and drink must come out in our urine, feces and sweat. Knowing that, we can estimate how much of each of these nutrients is in a population s bodily waste if we know their diet. Previous studies by Guest and others have assessed the potential for recovering the nutrients from human waste across the globe and identified locations with a surplus of human waste-derived nutrients relative to the local demand for agricultural fertilizers. The new study is the first to describe human waste-derived nutrient supply-demand location relationships using a single mathematical equation,  Guest said.  The quality of sanitation infrastructure varies greatly across the globe, as do people s diets and the availability of land suitable for agriculture. Having the means to characterize and quantitatively compare a location s nutrient-recovery potential can go a long way to better inform decision-makers when it comes to future sanitation and agriculture policy. The team performed extensive numerical and geographic analyses of dietary, population, sanitation and agricultural data from 107 countries to accomplish this quantitative characterization at the global scale. The investigation revealed three distinct supply-demand typologies: countries with a co-located supply-demand; countries with a dislocated supply-demand; and countries with diverse supply-demand proximities.The United States and Australia, for example, fall under the dislocated supply-demand typology. They have intensive agriculture in areas far from large cities, thus the human waste-derived nutrient supply is far away from where it is needed, Guest said. Even with advanced sanitation infrastructure in place, this means that nutrients would need to be transported over large distances, either as heavy fluids or converted into concentrated crystalline products. Economically speaking, Guest said, it would make sense to work with a concentrated product to implement a human waste-derived fertilizer in these countries.The study reports that in countries with co-located supply-demand typologies like India, Nigeria and Uganda, human populations are more substantively in the proximity of agricultural areas, making local reuse possible. In many communities with co-located supply-demand, however, there is a need for improved sanitation infrastructure. Guest said implementing a human waste-derived fertilizer program could be highly beneficial to sanitation and agriculture in these places.Countries like Brazil, Mexico, China and Russia exhibit a continuum of co-location to dislocation of nutrient supply and demand. The study reports that policymakers would need to approach human waste-derived nutrient use with more regionalized strategies and a range of local reuse and transport approaches.  Higher income countries in this group may have the infrastructure and economic support for various technologies, but those with limited financial resources would require prioritization of resource-recovery technology in some areas,  Guest said.The team was surprised to find the typologies corresponded closely to the United Nations Human Development Index. Higher HDI-scoring countries like the U.S., Western Europe and Australia tend to fall in the dislocated supply-demand typology and lower HDI-scoring countries tend to fit the co-located supply-demand typology. Of course, there are exceptions, but we did not expect to find such a strong correlation,  Guest said.The team hopes this research will help clarify the salient economic, sanitation and agricultural characteristics of countries across the globe so that decision-makers can prioritize investment, policies and technologies that will advance goals for a circular economy and the provision of sanitation to all, Guest said.Reference: Echevarria D, Trimmer JT, Cusick RD, Guest JS.

The blood cells classified as lymphocytes are formed in the bone marrow. From there they travel through blood vessels to the thymus gland in the breastbone. They then form receptors on their cellular surface to identify and fight foreign matter. The T cells also stimulate the formation of B cells, which produce antibodies to attack viruses. Virus-specific immune responses by T cells can be detected in the blood months or even years after an infection.In view of the millions of people infected by Covid-19 and the emerging fourth wave of the pandemic, it is of great interest to learn more about the T cells that fight the virus. The T cells are enormously important for protecting against a SARS-CoV-2 infection or preventing serious illness.  We re especially interested in how many of these specific T cells are present in the body of an infected person, the qualities that enable these cells to respond to the virus, and how long the T cells last,  says Dr. Kilian Schober of the TUM Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene.An interdisciplinary team of researchers at TUM, Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and LMU Munich has now succeeded in developing a method for finding the T cell receptors that respond to SARS-CoV-2. The team divided blood samples taken from seriously infected Covid-19 patients into two pools. The samples in the first pool were then stimulated with the virus antigen, with the second pool left untreated.  This enabled us to identify the T cells that responded to the virus and characterize a precise phenotype,  says Dr. Herbert Schiller, group leader at Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen.  So we now have a profile to identify a T cell that fights SARS-CoV-2. The Munich researchers now know what T cells look like that have recently been exposed to the virus-fighting antigen. Similar T cells were found not only in the blood, but also in the respiratory tract of patients. This made it possible to distinguish between cells still in the  hot phase  and those that have become dormant ( cold )   in other words, whether a patient is still fighting the infection or has already overcome it. The results of the study are highly significant. They enable us to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in different organs (blood or lungs), different activation states (antigen seen recently or not) and in different illness contexts (seriously ill/virus positive or mildly ill/virus negative).  We now have a better understanding of the appearance of T cells targeting SARS-CoV-2 and how numerous they are in the blood and respiratory tract,  says Prof. Dirk Busch, the Director of the TUM Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene.  In the future, this process can probably also be used to determine how many protective T cells are present after a vaccination. The team working with lab director Prof. Dirk Busch also succeeded in modifying T cells of healthy individuals to enable a first response to SARS-CoV-2.  That shows that it might be possible to equip the T cells of patients with receptors to fight the virus more effectively,  says Kilian Schober. This is the first step towards an adoptive T cell treatment for seriously ill Covid-19 patients. The process may also be applicable to other diseases through better characterization of T cell responses   an important hope for treatments of autoimmune conditions and cancers.

Their work has combined experimental measurements with mathematical modelling.The result is a new method which makes it possible to identify and locate the individual atoms in the nanoparticle, even if they are vibrating and moving.  Until now, atoms in nanoparticles have been expected to be static during observations. But the researchers  analyses of 3D atomic-scale images demonstrated that the original expectation is not sufficient. Instead, the researchers revealed a dynamic behavior of the atoms using a new analytical method.In their work, the researchers have chosen to use a well-known catalytic nanoparticle material, namely molybdenum disulfide. Since the atomic structure of the material is well-known, it provided a good basis for interpreting the research group s 3D atomic-resolved images compiled using the unique TEAM 0.5 electron microscope at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which offers the highest picometre-scale resolution in the world.","Published: August 20, 2021"

To improve their performance, a technique called laboratory evolution can be used, which American chemical engineer Frances Arnold pioneered and for which she received the Nobel Prize in 2018. Directed evolution imitates natural selection, allowing scientists to use the power of biology to improve the ability of proteins to carry out tasks such as catalysing a specific chemical reaction.But although the research team had recently used laboratory evolution to improve a designed enzyme by more than 1,000 fold, it was unknown how evolution boosts its activity. Until now. Lead author Professor Adrian Mulholland of Bristol s School of Chemistry said:  Evolution can make catalysts much more active. The thing is, evolution works in mysterious ways: for example, mutations that apparently improve catalysis often involve changes in amino acids far from the active site where the reaction happens.   We wanted to understand how evolution can transform inefficient designer biocatalysts into highly active enzymes,"" the first author of the study Dr Adrian Bunzel, said. To do so, the international research team from Bristol, the ETH Zurich and the University of Waikato (NZ) turned to molecular computer simulations. He added:  These show that evolution changes the way the protein moves   its dynamics. Put simply, evolution  tunes  the flexibility of the whole protein.  The team also identified the network of amino acids in the protein responsible for this  tuning . These networks involve parts of the protein that are changed by evolution. Dr Bunzel explained:  After evolution, the whole protein seems to work together to accelerate the reaction. This is important because when we design enzymes, we often focus only on the active site only, and forget about the rest of the protein.  Professor Mulholland said:  This sort of analysis could help to design more effective  de novo  enzymes, for reactions that previously we could not target.  The research, published in Nature Chemistry, reveals how evolution makes designer enzymes more powerful, paving the way to tailor-made catalysts for green chemistry. The researchers will now use their findings to help design new protein catalysts.ReferenceBunzel HA, Anderson JLR, Hilvert D, Arcus VL, van der Kamp MW, Mulholland AJ.

This research has implications for recreational activities in colder climates, such as hiking and skiing.Body temperature is maintained in several ways. Although your body subconsciously adjusts energy, fluid secretion, and blood flow to control heat loss through shivering, sweating, and dilation or constriction of blood vessels, a person s conscious behavior seeking shelter or relief when too hot or too cold plays an important role in keeping the body s core temperature within the narrow range required by its systems.  Both behavioral and autonomic thermoregulation depend on input from sensors located centrally and peripherally in the body,  notes Professor Nishiyasu.During exercise, heat produced by muscles is partially dispersed to the surroundings with the help of temperature-regulating responses like sweating. In addition, skin temperature sensation is reduced, possibly because of a built-in mechanism that dulls pain during exercise by releasing opioids in the brain this is also known as a runner s high.Normally, the perception of core body temperature is unaffected by these changes. In cold environments, however, heat that is produced by muscles during exercise is lost to the environment more easily. In fact, in a previous study, the research team demonstrated that shivering kicks in at a lower core temperature during exercise than it does at rest.Lead author Tomomi Fujimoto explains,  While this suggested to us that temperature inputs to the hypothalamus were affected, the question remained whether exercise affected skin or core temperature sensation in cold environments. To answer this question, the team monitored skin temperature, core body temperature (measured by inserting a probe through the nasal cavity), skin sensation, and perception of cold, as well as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen uptake in healthy young men, both as they rested and as they performed low-intensity exercise while partially submerged in a cold water tank. Skin temperature sensation appeared to be unaffected in this scenario because the exercise was low intensity, that is, not intense enough to elicit a  high ; however, they found that the perception of core body temperature was affected by exercise.This study revealed important information for people living in colder climates or those who perform recreational water activities. Both physiological and behavioral thermoregulation can be affected by reduced perception of the cold. Consequently, there is a need for such people to pay close attention to body temperature.Reference: Fujimoto T, Fujii N, Dobashi K, et al.

Based on past studies in mouse models and human cell cultures, researchers assumed that these mutations would leave individuals susceptible to a wide range of viral infections. They found instead that none of the four people in the cohort they studied, ages 7 to 32, showed signs of inadequate antiviral immunity. Rather, they all suffered from a systemic autoinflammatory condition that resulted from a dysregulated response to TNF, an important protein involved in controlling inflammation and cell death. TBK1 signaling activates the body s antiviral mechanisms to fight off infection and block different stages of viral replication, as well as control TNF-mediated inflammation,  says lead author Justin Taft, PhD, an investigator in the Department of Microbiology, the Precision Immunology Institute, and the Center for Inborn Errors of Immunity at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  But if a mutation prevents expression of the TBK1 gene or disrupts its function, then cells become overly sensitive to TNF. And that can trigger a disproportionate amount of cell death, which sets off a violent cascade of debris from dying cells that inflames surrounding tissue and fuels the inflammation. By treating TBK1-deficient individuals with anti-TNF therapeutics, the Mount Sinai-led team confirmed its suspicions about the underlying biology of the genetically driven condition.  We have essentially defined a new disease and its associated mechanisms of autoinflammation, which previously were managed with steroid treatments, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other non-specific therapeutics clinicians deemed worth trying,  says Dusan Bogunovic, PhD, Director of the Center for Inborn Errors of Immunity; Associate Professor of Oncological Sciences, Microbiology, and Pediatrics; member of the Precision Immunology Institute and The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute; and senior author of the study.  We were able to target the condition directly and effectively with TNF inhibitors once we knew the causative factors of the inflammation. And the clinical improvement was quick and substantial. For Dr. Taft, the work of the global team of researchers underscores the power of the increasingly vital field of personalized medicine.  We started with four individuals who were known to have a homozygous TBK1 mutation, and did extensive lab work to determine how the defect could induce this autoinflammatory reaction,  says Dr. Taft.  And from the genetics we uncovered not only a plausible mechanism of the disease and new information around TBK1 biology, but identified a disease-specific treatment that significantly improves the autoinflammatory condition.

Now, new research from Georgetown University Medical Center offers surprisingly good news by countering this view.The findings, published August 19, 2021, in Nature Human Behavior, show that two key brain functions, which allow us to attend to new information and to focus on what s important in a given situation, can in fact improve in older individuals. These functions underlie critical aspects of cognition such as memory, decision making, and self-control, and even navigation, math, language and reading. These results are amazing, and have important consequences for how we should view aging,  says the study s senior investigator, Michael T. Ullman, PhD, a professor in the Department of Neuroscience and director of Georgetown s Brain and Language Lab. People have widely assumed that attention and executive functions decline with age, despite intriguing hints from some smaller-scale studies that raised questions about these assumptions,  he says.  But the results from our large study indicate that critical elements of these abilities actually improve during aging, likely because we simply practice these skills throughout our life. This is all the more important because of the rapidly aging population, both in the U.S. and around the world,  Ullman says. He adds that with further research, it may be possible to deliberately improve these skills as protection against brain decline in healthy aging and disorders.The research team, which includes first author Jo o Ver ssimo, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, looked at three separate components of attention and executive function in a group of 702 participants aged 58 to 98. They focused on these ages since this is when cognition often changes the most during aging. The components they studied are the brain networks involved in alerting, orienting and executive inhibition. Each has different characteristics and relies on different brain areas and different neurochemicals and genes. Therefore, Ullman and Ver ssimo reasoned, the networks may also show different aging patterns.Alerting is characterized by a state of enhanced vigilance and preparedness in order to respond to incoming information. Orienting involves shifting brain resources to a particular location in space. The executive network inhibits distracting or conflicting information, allowing us to focus on what s important. We use all three processes constantly,  Ver ssimo explains.  For example, when you are driving a car, alerting is your increased preparedness when you approach an intersection. Orienting occurs when you shift your attention to an unexpected movement, such as a pedestrian. And executive function allows you to inhibit distractions such as birds or billboards so you can stay focused on driving. The study found that only alerting abilities declined with age. In contrast, both orienting and executive inhibition actually improved.The researchers hypothesize that because orienting and inhibition are simply skills that allow people to selectively attend to objects, these skills can improve with lifelong practice. The gains from this practice can be large enough to outweigh the underlying neural declines, Ullman and Ver ssimo suggest. In contrast, they believe that alerting declines because this basic state of vigilance and preparedness cannot improve with practice.   Because of the relatively large number of participants, and because we ruled out numerous alternative explanations, the findings should be reliable and so may apply quite broadly,  Ver ssimo says. Moreover, he explains that  because orienting and inhibitory skills underlie numerous behaviors, the results have wide-ranging implications. The findings not only change our view of how aging affects the mind, but may also lead to clinical improvements, including for patients with aging disorders such as Alzheimer s disease,  says Ullman.

Our data show that the acoustic display of rattlesnakes, which has been interpreted for decades as a simple acoustic warning signal about the presence of the snake, is in fact a far more intricate interspecies communication signal,  says senior author Boris Chagnaud at Karl-Franzens-University Graz.  The sudden switch to the high-frequency mode acts as a smart signal fooling the listener about its actual distance to the sound source. The misinterpretation of distance by the listener thereby creates a distance safety margin. Rattlesnakes vigorously shake their tails to warn other animals of their presence. Past studies have shown that rattling varies in frequency, but little is known about the behavioral relevance of this phenomenon or what message it sends to listeners. A clue to this mystery came during a visit to an animal facility, where Chagnaud noticed that rattling increased in frequency when he approached rattlesnakes but decreased when he walked away.Based on this simple observation, Chagnaud and his team conducted experiments in which objects appeared to move toward rattlesnakes. One object they used was a human-like torso, and another was a looming black disk that seemed to move closer by increasing in size. As the potential threats approached, the rattling rate increased to approximately 40 Hz and then abruptly switched to an even higher frequency range, between 60 and 100 Hz.Additional results showed that rattlesnakes adapt their rattling rate in response to the approach velocity of an object rather than its size.  In real life, rattlesnakes make use of additional vibrational and infrared signals to detect approaching mammals, so we would expect the rattling responses to be even more robust,  Chagnaud says.To test how this change in rattling rate is perceived by others, the researchers designed a virtual reality environment in which 11 participants were moved through a grassland toward a hidden snake. Its rattling rate increased as the humans approached and suddenly jumped to 70 Hz at a virtual distance of 4 meters. The listeners were asked to indicate when the sound source appeared to be 1 meter away. The sudden increase in rattling frequency caused the participants to underestimate their distance to the virtual snake. Snakes do not just rattle to advertise their presence, but they evolved an innovative solution: a sonic distance warning device similar to the one included in cars while driving backwards,  Chagnaud says.  Evolution is a random process, and what we might interpret from today s perspective as elegant design is in fact the outcome of thousands of trials of snakes encountering large mammals. The snake rattling co-evolved with mammalian auditory perception by trial and error, leaving those snakes that were best able to avoid being stepped on.

But while models evaluating sources of mercury in the oceans have focused on mercury deposited directly from the atmosphere, a new study led by Peter Raymond, professor of ecosystem ecology at the Yale School of the Environment and published in Nature Geoscience shows that rivers are actually the main source of the toxic heavy metal along the world s coasts. It kind of rewires the global mercury cycle,  Raymond says. Previously, it was believed that most mercury in the open ocean was deposited there from the atmosphere, and then made its way into coastal areas. But now it appears that most mercury flows into the coastal ocean areas from rivers, and from there it moves out into the open ocean.  Currently, policymakers mainly focus on controlling atmospheric emission and deposition of mercury, while the contribution of river mercury to coastal oceans is not well understood,  says Maodian Liu, a postdoctoral fellow in Raymond s lab. He says that the new findings underscore the importance of limiting the mercury that makes its way into rivers. The researchers also investigated changes in the yearly cycle of riverine mercury outflow, finding that globally, levels were highest in August and September. And they analyzed which rivers were the largest contributors of mercury; ten rivers are responsible for half of the riverine mercury. The Amazon River is at the top of the list, followed by the Ganges in India and Bangladesh and the Yangtze in China. While other recent studies have also estimated the amounts of riverine mercury, Raymond says that those studies didn t have the same level of specificity with regards to which rivers had the highest amounts of mercury and when during the year those levels were highest.  The community hadn t really agreed on the role of rivers,  he says, adding that this new work helps strengthen the case that rivers are indeed the largest source of oceanic mercury. The burning of coal is predominantly responsible for atmospheric mercury, which eventually ends up both in the ocean and on landmasses. The mercury that rivers transport into the ocean can come from atmospheric mercury that has ended up in soils; it can also come from other anthropogenic sources like gold mining, and to a lesser extent naturally occurring geologic sources. In addition, as climate change induces more severe storms and floods, mercury that has lain dormant in soils for long periods of time may increasingly be transported into the coastal oceans, the researchers say. Raymond says future work could focus on understanding the processes that affect mercury in those  hotspots  where the concentrations coming into the ocean are highest, as well as examining the connections to fisheries in those areas.  Fish consumption is the most important dietary source of human exposure to mercury,  Liu notes. Ultimately, this improved understanding of how and where mercury gets into the oceans will help inform regulations to reduce the amount of mercury in the fish on all of our plates.ReferenceLiu M, Zhang Q, Maavara T, Liu S, Wang X, Raymond PA.

The antibodies worked for every alphavirus tested, meaning they potentially could form the basis of treatments or serve as a template for a universal vaccine.The findings are published Aug. 19 in the journal Cell. In the U.S., the alphavirus we worry most about is chikungunya virus, which can cause debilitating arthritis, but we also do see cases of encephalitis caused by Eastern equine encephalitis virus,  said senior author Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine and a professor of molecular microbiology and of pathology & immunology.  Alphaviruses used to be limited to the tropics, but in recent years they ve been spreading into new geographic areas. Most are still uncommon, but together they cause millions of infections and a considerable burden of disease, and we don t have specific therapies or vaccines for any of them. The alphavirus group includes more than 30 species, split into two branches. Viruses such as chikungunya, Mayaro, O nyong-nyong and Ross River, all of which cause fever, rash and arthritis, historically had been limited to Africa, Asia and Europe. However, beginning in 2013, chikungunya worked its way into the Caribbean and parts of North and South America. The other branch of alphaviruses, found in the Americas, includes Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses and causes brain infections.Diamond and colleagues previously identified a group of antibodies that neutralize many members of the arthritis-causing branch of the alphavirus group. But those antibodies didn t work against all of the viruses that cause arthritis and failed entirely against the ones that cause brain infections.To find antibodies that would protect against the whole alphavirus group, Diamond and colleagues   including co-first authors Arthur S. Kim, PhD, then a graduate student, and Natasha M. Kafai, an MD/PhD student   screened a set of antibodies produced by two people who had been infected with chikungunya virus. They tested the antibodies against a panel of alphaviruses representing both branches of the group. Two antibodies recognized all of the alphaviruses tested.Then, they assessed whether the antibodies could prevent arthritis or brain infection in animals. Using mice, they tested each antibody against two alphaviruses that cause arthritis and three that cause brain infections. Both antibodies protected the animals against all of the viruses.Further experiments showed that the antibodies worked by blocking developing virus particles from exiting one cell en route to infecting another. The antibodies attach to part of a viral protein called E1 that is exposed only during the exiting process. Once the virus has fully formed and detached from the cell, the E1 protein is folded into the virus particle and hidden.In a related paper being published in the same issue of Cell, James E. Crowe, MD, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, also reports that antibodies targeting the E1 protein bind to a wide range of alphaviruses, prevent them from exiting cells and protect animals against both arthritis and brain infections. Crowe and Diamond are longtime collaborators, and each contributed to the other s paper.The two studies start from different points   Diamond began with a virus that causes arthritis; Crowe started with one that causes brain infections   but arrive at basically the same conclusion: The E1 protein could be the key to universal protection against alphaviruses. If we could figure out how to make a vaccine that targets the E1 protein effectively, it would be a cost-effective way to provide broad protection for people in resource-limited places, which is where most alphavirus infections occur,  Diamond said.  It s challenging to make such a vaccine since the target is hidden most of the time. But there are techniques that can be used to make the immune system focus on E1 and generate a good antibody response against it. That s the next step toward creating a universal vaccine.

The work, which is the most extensive examination of immune cell infiltration in canine glioma to date, adds to the body of evidence that these brain tumors might recruit cells that aid in immunosuppression. The findings could have implications for future immunotherapy-based glioma treatments in both humans and dogs.Glial cells are support cells located throughout the brain and spinal cord. When those cells become cancerous, the resulting tumor is called a glioma. In dogs, gliomas are the second most common type of tumor in the central nervous system and represent about 35% of all intracranial cancers. Median survival time for dogs with glioma treated with radiation therapy ranges from nine to 14 months, which is similar to the 14 month median survival time for humans treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.There are three types of canine glioma: oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma or undefined glioma. Each of these subtypes can be further classified as low or high-grade based on certain microscopic features. Although glioma subtype and grade affect survival and treatment choice in humans, it is currently unknown whether the same is true for dogs.Immunotherapy harnesses the power of the body s immune system to attack cancer. Though immunotherapy has shown promise in certain types of cancers, it hasn t been successful in glioma in humans, possibly because gliomas have been shown to suppress the immune system in order to facilitate tumor growth. Researchers are trying to better understand the interaction between glioma and the immune system with hopes of improving therapeutic outcomes. If we want to pursue immunotherapy for glioma, we first need to understand how these tumors interact with the immune system,  says Gregory Krane, first author of the research and a veterinary pathologist who recently received his Ph.D. from North Carolina State University.  There are many shared features between canine and human glioma, which makes researching the immune system in canine glioma a good approach to addressing questions about this cancer in both humans and dogs. The multi-institutional research team examined 73 different gliomas obtained from veterinary patients seen at the NC State College of Veterinary Medicine between 2006 and 2018. Utilizing immunohistochemical tagging and computerized image analysis, the team identified the numbers of each type of immune cell in each tumor: B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and macrophages. The team found higher numbers of Tregs and polarized macrophages in high- versus low-grade tumors, but no differences for other immune cells between different tumor types or grades. Tregs inhibit aspects of the immune response,  Krane says.  In healthy individuals, this prevents autoimmune disease. But cancers can recruit and activate Tregs to prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor. We found that Tregs were more abundant in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. We hypothesize that Tregs may be involved in glioma-mediated immunosuppression, although that will require further research. The research team also counted the number of macrophages in each tumor, which can be polarized to either end of a spectrum referred to as M1 or M2 polarization. In a general sense, M1-polarized macrophages are pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor, and M2-polarized macrophages are the opposite. They found that the macrophage population in high-grade gliomas tended to be polarized towards the M2 phenotype. These macrophage polarization data can expand the glioma immunosuppression hypothesis by providing another mechanism by which gliomas may suppress the immune system in the dog,  Krane says.Krane is hopeful that this study may lead to a better understanding of how gliomas affect the immune system, and eventually to improved immunotherapies for glioma.  Using the dog as a preclinical model for understanding the immune response to glioma could lead to treatments that will help both dogs and people,  Krane says.  Though further work is needed, our data provide some support to utilize canine patients with glioma to evaluate therapies targeting Tregs or macrophage polarization designed for use in humans.

The discovery, published in the journal Frontiers in Oncology, can help doctors choose the treatment that should enable patients to live longer.Gliomas are graded on a scale of one to four. Grade four gliomas are the most aggressive and are also known as glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults. It usually has to be surgically removed, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both, to eliminate what could not be surgically removed and ensure the tumor does not return. However, patient survival tends to be low owing to the tumor s resistance to treatment. According to most estimates, 80% of patients submitted to radiation therapy suffer a relapse a few months later. Our study provides important information for use in screening patients prior to deciding whether radiation therapy should be used. It s a large signature. We identified 31 genes that may indicate resistance or sensitivity to radiation when altered. So it s possible to verify whether there are tumor cells that are highly resistant to radiation, potentially assisting physicians in deciding on the optimal treatment,  said Val ria Valente, a professor at S o Paulo State University s School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCF-UNESP) in Araraquara and a researcher affiliated with CTC, one of the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Centers (RIDCs) supported by S o Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP.The study was also funded directly by FAPESP via a Regular Research Grant.To arrive at the biomarker panel, the researchers first analyzed gene expression profiles in glioblastoma cell lines, having already found that resistance to treatment varied depending on cell lineage. They then analyzed the transcriptomes using RNA sequencing to identify the genes expressed by tumor cells and the gene expression patterns associated with sensitivity or resistance to radiation therapy. They confirmed the results of these laboratory analyses by cross-tabulating them with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) containing the genomes and clinical information for glioblastoma patients showing sensitivity or resistance to radiation. Some lineages are more proliferative, and these are also the most sensitive to radiation. When we correlated that finding with the transcriptome data, we found overall gene expression patterns linked more to one group or another,  Valente said.Like any type of cancer, gliomas are heterogeneous, she added. This is particularly so in the case of these tumors, which are made up of different cell types, some more radioresistant than others.  The point of this biomarker panel is that it can be used to identify tumors containing cells with the gene expression signature associated with radioresistance,  she said.The correlations between patient clinical data and the radioresistance signature showed that patients with alterations in at least 21 genes in the panel did not respond well to the treatment. Survival was low whether or not they were irradiated.  That s an important indication because it shows there are certain individuals who won t benefit from radiation treatment, which will cause additional suffering and won t help them live longer,  Valente said.","Published: August 20, 2021"

This finding, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, is the first time that such cross-neutralising reactivity has been demonstrated in humans, and further boosts hopes of developing an effective and broad-spectrum next-generation vaccine against different coronaviruses.Among the coronavirus family, one sub-group relies on the ACE2 molecule to enter human cells. Both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 belong to this group as well as a number of coronaviruses circulating in animals such as bats, pangolins and civets. While the exact route of transmission remains unknown, these viruses have the potential to jump from animals to humans and could start the next pandemic. Collectively, this group of viruses is called sarbecovirus. We explored the possibility of inducing pan-sarbecovirus neutralising antibodies that can block the common human ACE2-virus interaction, which will be protective not only against all known and unknown SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, but also future sarbecoviruses,  said Dr Chee Wah Tan, Senior Research Fellow with Duke-NUS Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) programme and co-first author of this study.To test their hypothesis, researchers recruited eight people who recovered from SARS-CoV-1, which was responsible for the 2003 SARS epidemic, as well as ten healthy people and ten COVID-19 survivors. They then compared the immune response of the three groups before and after they were vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In particular, they wanted to understand whether the neutralising antibodies developed in SARS-Vaccinated group could wipe out both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses as well as other sarbecoviruses, including potentially zoonotic sarbecoviruses that have been identified in bats and pangolins. Prior to vaccination, SARS-CoV-1 survivors had detectable neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 but no or low-level anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. After receiving two doses of the mRNA vaccine, all displayed high levels of neutralising antibodies against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,  said Dr Wanni Chia, Research Fellow at the Duke-NUS EID  programme and co-first author of this study.  Most importantly, they are the only group with a broad spectrum of neutralising antibodies against ten sarbecoviruses that were chosen to be examined. Our study points to a novel strategy for the development of next-generation vaccines, which will not only help us control the current COVID-19 pandemic, but may also prevent or reduce the risk of future pandemics caused by related viruses,  said Professor Wang Linfa from Duke-NUS EID programme, who is the senior corresponding author of this study. Professor Wang s team made an astute serendipitous observation in an ongoing national multicentre immune monitoring study of COVID-19 vaccination called the Singapore COVID-19 Vaccine Immune Response and Protection Study (SCOPE), which is coordinated by NCID. As emerging variants of concern have already demonstrated some degree of immune evasion against the first-generation vaccines, this discovery has the potential to address that problem as the world continues COVID-19 vaccination to exit the pandemic. In addition, this can potentially act as a highly promising preventive vaccine against future coronavirus pandemics,  said Associate Professor David Lye, Director, Infectious Disease Research and Training Office, NCID and joint corresponding author of the study.The team conducted their investigation using an improved version of the surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT) developed by Duke-NUS in early 2020. Prof Wang and his team invented the sVNT assay, trade named cPass[1], which has been granted Emergency Use Authorisation by the US FDA to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibodies in human sera following infection or vaccination. Dr Tan and Dr Chia are part of Prof Wang s team and co-inventors of the sVNT. The improved multiplex sVNT allows simultaneous detection of neutralising antibodies against different sarbecoviruses in a single tube, thus playing a pivotal role in studies like this that require accurate side-by-side comparison of neutralising antibody levels against different viruses.The team is currently conducting a proof-of-concept study to develop a third-generation vaccine against different coronaviruses (3GCoVax) as well as broad neutralising antibodies for therapy and is looking to recruit individuals who recovered from SARS infection in 2003.

This circRNA, called circURI1, exerts an anti-metastatic effect by sequestering heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM) in order to modulate alternative splicing in gastric cancer. It is the first reported association between circRNA and alternative splicing. This work was published in PNAS online. Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignant tumor and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, largely due to its metastatic spread in patients. CircRNAs are a class of natural covalent closed single-stranded RNA molecules that have emerged as key regulators of human cancers, yet their modes of action in gastric cancer have remained obscure. Led by Prof. LIN Wenchu of the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS), in collaboration with Prof. SHAN Ge and Associate Prof. HU Shanshan from the University of Science and Technology of China, the researchers performed gastric cancer circRNA profiling and identified circURI1 as having higher expression in gastric cancer compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies revealed that circURI1 repressed cell migration and invasion in vitro and gastric cancer metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circURI1 acts directly interacts with hnRNPM in a sequence-dependent manner to modulate alternative splicing of a subset of genes related to cell migration, thus suppressing gastric cancer metastasis. This study provides a new perspective on the molecular basis of cancer metastasis by highlighting the activity of circRNAs, and suggests that circURI1 may play a potential role in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.

The target, known as ZMYND8, isn t a mutated gene, rather an epigenetic regulatory protein that cancer cells need to control gene expression crucial for them to stay alive and grow. We ve discovered that cancer cells in patients with AML rely heavily on ZMYND8, and thanks to a sophisticated CRISPR-based screening approach, we pinpointed the exact  druggable pocket  to target,  said senior author Junwei Shi, PhD, an assistant professor of Cancer Biology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and member of the Penn Epigenetics Institute and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute. The findings suggest that delivering drug inhibitors against ZMYND8 could disrupt the AML vulnerable gene regulation circuits,  added Zhendong Cao, a PhD student investigator in Shi s lab.  It s an opportunity to develop better precision medicine compounds than current treatments to treat this blood cancer which we are currently working on right now. AML affects more than 20,000 patients a year, including both children and adults, and has a five-year survival rate of just 27 percent for people over 20. The standard of care includes chemotherapy; however, not all patients respond, so newer approaches are needed to expand options and improve survival.CRISPR has allowed scientists to not only modify genes with more ease and less cost than previous approaches, but also enabled them to simultaneously screen for thousands of specific functional protein domains with high potential for therapeutic targeting.The researchers used CRISPR to precisely disrupt the domain function of proteins in cancer cells, map their molecular functions, and modify them to use in mouse models. They found that inhibiting the epigenetic reader function of ZMYND8 in mice left them with smaller tumors and better survival.The researchers also found a biomarker   the expression level or the epigenetic status of the gene IRF8 from AML cells   to predict the sensitivity of cancer cells to a ZMYND8 inhibitor. Furthermore, the researchers validated the high expression of IRF8 and presence of IRF8 enhancer DNA element using blood samples from patients treated at Penn Medicine to support their finding. Many genetic and epigenetic alterations have been identified in cancer but few are actionable targets,  said co-author Shelley L. Berger, PhD, the Daniel S. Och University Professor in the departments of Cell and Developmental Biology and Genetics in the Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Penn Epigenetics Institute.  CRISPR revealed here, for the time, an unexpected epigenetic-linked molecular circuity that AML is dependent on, and one that we can potentially manipulate. It opens a new door toward better treatments for these patients using next-generation epigenetic inhibitors. Reference: Cao Z, Budinich KA, Huang H, et al.

While the team had shown that bats learn using mimicry of adult noises, no in-depth study had yet revealed the intricacies of bat babbling. Fernandez listened in on the babbling sounds of 20 bat pups, recording over 55,000 syllables over 216 different bouts of babbling. These bouts, multisyllabic squeaks that can easily be detected by the human ear, could last for up to 43 minutes. While this gargantuan task required some extreme patience, Fernandez clearly relished the study.  I think maybe it sounds boring, but it isn t at all   babbling behavior is very interactive   pups interact with their moms.

Her analysis assessed whether pup babbling had any of the eight different features of baby babbling:Remarkably, the bat pups  noises had all eight of these features. In particular, the universality of babbling   both male and female bats took part   was a surprise to Fernandez.  Adult females do not produce the major part of the adult vocal repertoire so although they learn it they don t produce it, so only the males are singing and only the males are tutors.  In their discussion, the authors suggest that female pups learn the repertoire as a preparation for assessing the quality of future mating songs directed at them.","Published: August 19, 2021"

There are many different types of proteins expressed in the human body, such as enzymes, receptors and signaling molecules. Proteins are encoded by DNA. The central dogma of molecular biology specifies that DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is then translated to proteins. This is a highly simplified summary but enables you to understand where proteins come from. If there is a mutation or an error that occurs during this process, it can result in a faulty or absent protein, which can lead to human disease. By developing therapeutics that target the molecular processes that result in protein production, we can work to treat the cause of a disease, rather than just the symptoms. To learn more about transcription and translation, visit our summary piece. Examples of such therapeutics include gene therapies and RNA-based therapies. The COVID-19 global pandemic has cast a spotlight on RNA, as the first vaccines to receive authorization for human use were mRNA-based. However, using RNA in a therapeutic context is not a novel idea. The authorization of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines is a culmination of many decades of research effort from groups across the world. Ultimately, there have been many barriers to overcome in the process of developing RNA therapeutics, and many challenges remain.Studies that knock out the PEG10 gene have demonstrated that the subsequent protein plays a role in embryonic development, binding to cellular RNAs including Hbegf (Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor), a type of RNA that is important in placentation (the forming of the placenta inside the uterus). Previous research had shown that another retrotransposon-derived protein   known as ARC   could form structures that resemble viruses and were able to transfer RNA between cells. Would it therefore be possible to engineer retrotransposon proteins to become a ""courier"" for genetic material? It was considered but had not yet been proven.""Working with Eugene Koonin and his team at NCBI, we identified a number of retroelement- derived proteins in the human genome that were predicted to form capsids, including PEG10. We screened these proteins to find one that not only formed capsids, but also exhibited specificity for what mRNA was packaged inside the capsids. PEG10 fit the bill,"" Blake Lash, graduate student in the Zhang lab, and co-first author of the study, told Technology Networks. ""It mostly had its own mRNA inside the capsids, which told us that there was a specific mechanism guiding the packaging process, and we hoped we would be able to take advantage of that to reprogram PEG10 packaging.""2.

Ratlas is an atlas of the rat brain that has been developed to revolutionise and support vital experiments on the health and disorders of brain function. Just published in an article in the open access journal, Brain and Neuroscience Advances, neuroscientists from the University of Nottingham, working with colleagues at the Leibniz Institute of Neurobiology in Magdeburg, Germany, have created the first atlas   Ratlas   to present a close likeness to the brains of the rats most commonly used in UK neuroscience research, the Lister hooded rat. The new brain atlas - Ratlas - delivers more accurate coordinates, because it is more representative of the brains of rats used in UK neuroscience research. As a direct result, this will minimise the requirement for laborious pilot experiments and help to reduce animal numbers used for research. The new atlas was constructed based on the live magnetic resonance (MR) images of seven brains of Lister hooded rats, one of the main rat strains used in the UK for studies of the brain mechanisms of cognition and behaviour in health and disorder. These MR images were used to form an  average  rat brain, which was then combined with an average of computer tomography (CT)-generated images of the surrounding skulls. Labels were added to the brain images to aid identification of different brain regions. The digital format of the atlas also makes it very user friendly and accessible, compared to traditional atlases. In future work, the researchers in Nottingham and Magdeburg plan to generate additional atlases, based on other commonly used rat and mouse strains, including both sexes and different developmental stages. You can find and use Ratlas for free at: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ratlas-lham/ Importantly, Ratlas is freely available to everyone thanks to it being in BNA s Gold Open Access journal. Open access for all is a critical part of the BNA s credibility in neuroscience campaign, promoting credibility initiatives that support reproducibility, replicability and reliability in science.

The NTU researchers identified the exact cellular-level mechanism by which the bacteria can penetrate and hijack a plant s immune system, therefore leaving them vulnerable to infection. The advance sheds light on this longstanding mystery and provides new insights on how to stop bacterial infections that can lay waste to important crops such as rice, wheat, soybean, and tomato.The study, led by Associate Professor Miao Yansong from the School of Biological Sciences, together with Assistant Professor Yu Jing from NTU s School of Materials Science and Engineering, has important implications for food safety and sustainability.

Most prosthetic limbs are controlled using electromyography, a way of recording electrical activity from the muscles, but this approach provides only limited control of the prosthesis.Researchers at MIT s Media Lab have now developed an alternative approach that they believe could offer much more precise control of prosthetic limbs. After inserting small magnetic beads into muscle tissue within the amputated residuum, they can precisely measure the length of a muscle as it contracts, and this feedback can be relayed to a bionic prosthesis within milliseconds.In a new study appearing today in Science Robotics, the researchers tested their new strategy, called magnetomicrometry (MM), and showed that it can provide fast and accurate muscle measurements in animals. They hope to test the approach in people with amputation within the next few years. Our hope is that MM will replace electromyography as the dominant way to link the peripheral nervous system to bionic limbs.

Everything from exercise, sleep patterns, calories consumed and heart rhythms can be tracked by a wearable device.But timely and accurate data is also especially valuable for doctors treating patients with complicated health conditions using virtual care.A new study from the Southern Medical Program (SMP), based at UBC Okanagan, has examined the use of wearable health technology and telehealth to treat patients with Parkinson s disease.Dr. Daryl Wile, a movement disorder specialist and SMP clinical assistant professor, routinely uses telehealth to connect with Parkinson s patients across the vast and rugged landscape of BC s Interior. Even prior to the pandemic, telehealth helped deliver specialized care to patients living in remote and rural settings,  says Wile, a clinical investigator with the Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management.  But with the complex nature of Parkinson s, we wanted to enhance these appointments to better understand how movements vary throughout a patient s entire day.""To add a new layer of health information, Wile and the research team added wearable technology to the equation. We recruited Parkinson s patients with either tremors or involuntary movements,  says Joshua Yoneda, SMP student and co-author of the study.  We then divided them into two groups   some using telehealth and device-based health tracking and others attending traditional face-to-face appointments. The telehealth group wore wearable devices to track their movements, involuntary or not, throughout waking hours. The reported data was then reviewed during telehealth appointments to identify peak times patients experienced Parkinson s symptoms. With the integration of accurate and reliable data from wearable devices, we were able to tailor a patient s medication to better manage their symptoms throughout the day,  adds Wile.As part of the study, patients were asked a series of questions from the standardized Parkinson Disease Quality of Life Index. Both study groups were assessed at intervals of six weeks, three months and six months.Overall, the patients using the wearable devices reported positive experiences and health outcomes in combination with telehealth appointments to access specialized care.

Apart from dynamic periods when the brain is learning new information or skills, the number of the  glutamatergic  synapses, the major type of synapses that neurons use to activate each other, largely remains constant in adults.In brain disorders such as Alzheimer s, these synaptic connections, which hold our precious memories, are known to break down too early and disappear. This synapse degeneration is thought to start long before the loss of memory and accelerate as diseases progress. The causes of synapse degeneration in neurodegenerative disorders has not been well understood, mainly because scientists have not yet unraveled the key mechanisms that normally hold together these tiny structures (an average of one micrometer in diameter) throughout our lifetime.Neurobiologists at the University of California San Diego have now uncovered the long-sought-after mechanisms behind the maintenance of glutamatergic synapses. Based on this fundamental discovery, Division of Biological Sciences Postdoctoral Scholar Bo Feng, Professor Yimin Zou and their colleagues have identified the main components driving amyloid beta-associated synapse degeneration. Amyloid beta are peptides of 36 43 amino acids derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are the main component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer s disease.Despite tremendous efforts, drug discovery for Alzheimer s disease has not been successful. So far, the main approaches have been to either reduce amyloid beta production or clear amyloid beta plaques. The new discovery from UC San Diego researchers, published in Science Advances on August 18, 2021, suggests an alternative approach further downstream: protect synapses by directly blocking the toxic actions of amyloid beta.Glutamatergic synapses are highly polarized structures with a presynaptic part from one nerve cell and a postsynaptic part from another. This type of polarity ensures the proper direction of information flow. Zou s lab had previously found that during brain development the highly polarized synaptic structures are assembled by components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway: a powerful signaling pathway that polarizes cell-cell junctions along the tissue plane. Using super resolution microscopy, the researchers detected the precise location of these same PCP signaling components, called Celsr3, Frizzled3 and Vangl2, in the glutamatergic synapses in the adult brain. They then found that removing these components, essential for the initial assembly of synapses from adult neurons, can dramatically alter the number of synapses. These surprising discoveries suggest that the overall synapse number in a normal brain is maintained by a fine balance between Celsr3 (which stabilizes synapse) and Vangl2 (which disassembles synapses).Curious about whether these components are involved in synapse degeneration, they tested whether amyloid beta, a key driver of synapse loss in Alzheimer s disease, affects the function or interaction of these proteins. In a series of experiments, they showed that amyloid beta  oligomers bind to Celsr3 and allow Vangl2 to more effectively disassemble synapses, likely by weakening the interactions between Celsr3 and Frizzled3. This is as if amyloid beta has long discovered the Achilles  heel of our synapses,  said Zou, a professor in the Section of Neurobiology, Division of Biological Sciences.When the researchers removed Vangl2 from neurons, they found that amyloid beta can no longer cause synapse degeneration both in neuronal cultures and in animals exposed to amyloid beta oligomers. Ryk, a regulator of the PCP pathway that interacts with Frizzled3 and Vangl2, is also found present in the adult synapses and functions in the same way as Vangl2 to mediate synapse disassembly. Blocking Ryk using function-blocking antibodies can protect synapses from amyloid beta-induced degeneration, the researchers found.To further test the hypothesis that this fundamental signaling pathway is a primary target of synapse degeneration in Alzheimer s disease, the Zou lab used 5XFAD mice, a well-known mouse model of amyloid beta pathology. This transgenic mouse carries five human mutations that cause Alzheimer s disease and therefore shows severe symptoms of synapse degeneration and cognitive function loss. They found that removing Ryk by gene knockout from adult neurons protected synapses and preserved cognitive function of 5XFAD mice. Infusion of the function blocking the Ryk antibody also protected synapses and preserved cognitive function in 5XFAD mice, suggesting the Ryk antibody is a potential therapeutic agent.These exciting results suggest that the PCP pathway is a direct target of amyloid beta-induced synapse loss in Alzheimer s disease. As amyloid beta pathology and synapse loss usually occurs in early stages of Alzheimer s disease, even before cognitive decline can be detected, early intervention, such as restoring the rebalance of the PCP pathway, will likely be beneficial for Alzheimer s patients,  said Zou.Neuroinflammation, reflected by astrocyte and microglia activation, is also a hallmark of Alzheimer s pathology, which can be induced by amyloid beta accumulation and is known to accelerate synapse loss. Excitingly, the Zou lab found that the Ryk antibody can also block the activation of astrocytes and microglia in 5XFAD mice. Although they cannot distinguish whether this is due to the indirect effect of synapse protection or the blockage of Ryk functions in inflammation, or both, Zou believes that the results are consistent with the improved cognitive behavior and further support Ryk as a potential therapeutic target for both protecting synapses and reducing inflammation in Alzheimer s disease. This discovery may be applicable to synapse degeneration in general as the PCP components may be the direct synaptic targets mediating synapse loss in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig s disease),  said Zou.Reference: Feng B, Freitas AE, Gorodetski L, et al.

The most harmful type of obesity is caused by the excessive accumulation of so-called ""deep"" fat. Contrary to fat stores located directly under the skin, deep, or ""visceral"", fat stores reside inside our abdominal cavity, where they envelop vital organs. In normal amounts, visceral fat supports various fundamental functions, such as reproduction. However, when it is too abundant, it produces unhealthy levels of proteins and hormones that negatively affect neighbouring tissues and organs. ""Excess visceral fat is very dangerous and at the same time very difficult to eliminate"", explains Henrique Veiga-Fernandes, principal investigator and co-director at the Champalimaud Research Programme in Portugal. ""In this project, our team set out to explore the mechanisms that naturally reduce it, with the hope of uncovering potential clinical applications"".The team's exploration proved successful. The results of the mouse study, published today (August 18th) in the journal Nature, present the first known neuro-immune process by which brain signals instruct immune function in visceral fat stores. This discovery offers several novel approaches for fighting obesity and obesity-related illness.","Published: August 19, 2021"

This has produced more energy than any previous inertial confinement fusion experiment, and proves ignition is possible, paving the way for reactions that produce more energy than they need to get started.Imperial College London physicists are already helping to analyse the data from the successful experiment, which was conducted on 8 August 2021. Imperial has also produced more than 30 PhD students that have gone on to work at the NIF. The College retains strong links with the facility, and others throughout the world, through the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies (CIFS).The Imperial team are now analysing the outputs of the experiment, using diagnostic methods they have created to understand what is happening in such extreme conditions. Dr Brian Appelbe, Research Associate in the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial, said:  The NIF lasers already created the most extreme conditions on Earth, but the new experiment appears to have doubled the previous temperature achieved. We have entered a regime we ve previously never been in   this is uncharted territory in our understanding of plasma. Dr Aidan Crilly, Research Associate in the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial, added:  Reproducing the conditions at the centre of the Sun will allow us to study states of matter we ve never been able to create in the lab before, including those found in stars and supernovae.""We could also gain insights into quantum states of matter and even conditions closer and closer to the beginning of the Big Bang   the hotter we get, the closer we get to the very first state of the Universe.

The study finds that this alignment may also have implications on cognition.The results published July 12 in Nature Communications help shed light on one of the biggest mysteries in biology   how the brain works, according to senior author Dr. Amy Kuceyeski, associate professor of mathematics in the Department of Radiology and in neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine. Specifically, the study is a first step towards understanding the relationship between the physical wiring in the brain and its flow of activity. Things as basic as how anatomy and physiology in the brain align are not understood in humans,  said Kuceyeski, who leads the Computational Connectomics Laboratory in the Department of Radiology.  If we want to be able to effectively treat neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases, we need to understand how brain structure and function interact. To begin to unravel this mystery, first author Zijin Gu, a doctoral student in the field of electrical and computer engineering based at Cornell s Ithaca campus and a member of the Computational Connectomics Laboratory, analyzed data from 941 young, healthy adults participating in the Human Connectome Project. The Human Connectome Project is a massive endeavor led by the National Institutes of Health to map all the pathways involved in human brain function.Gu used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to examine the brain s  wiring,  or bundles of myelinated axons, that transmit electrical signals. Then she compared that with resting-state functional MRI data, which detects brain activity patterns and can shed light on how different brain regions are working together when a person is just sitting in the MRI scanner. Using these tools, Gu showed that the relationship between brain wiring (aka structural connectivity) and brain co-activation (aka functional connectivity) varied in different parts of the brain.Structural and functional connectivity, she found, were most closely aligned in the parts of the brain involved in processing visual information and the subcortical areas of the brain involved in activities like memory and emotion. But there was less alignment between brain structure and function in brain s limbic system, which controls things like hunger and the fight or flight response, and the cerebellum, which coordinates movement.The degree of alignment between the physical structure of the brain in these regions and their activity varied among individuals and was more similar among related individuals in the study, such as siblings or twins. Specifically, tight alignment between the structural wiring and functional activity of the subcortical areas and cerebellum appeared to have a strong genetic component with close similarities between people who were related.The degree of connectivity in different brain regions also was associated with people s age, sex and their performance on cognitive tests. Men tend to have higher structural connectivity-functional connectivity coupling in the attention and limbic networks, while women had higher structural connectivity-functional connectivity coupling in subcortical networks,  Gu said.These sex differences may help explain why males and females often experience distinct symptoms with brain conditions like autism or ADHD, Kuceyeski explained.  If there are sex differences in the structural and functional alignment in the brain, that may give us clues about why behavior or symptoms vary among males and females with some atypical brain development,  she said.The team, which also included Keith Jamison  04, M.Eng.  06, a research associate in the Computational Connectomics Laboratory, and Mert Sabuncu, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering in the College of Engineering and in radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, plans to next analyze data on children, adolescents and older adult participants in the Human Connectome Project to learn more about the relationship between brain structure and function over the lifespan.They also plan to  build a brain model in a box  using mathematical modeling and machine learning to recreate some of the patterns they ve detailed in this study. This study is really a first step in understanding the structural and functional alignment of the human brain,  Kuceyeski said.  We can use this information to try to identify changes that occur as a result of brain disease, which might help guide the development of new therapies.

In most cases we don t know what messages are being transmitted. We wanted to develop an automatic method to analyse raw neural data of many different types, circumventing the need to manually decipher them. They tested the network, called DeepInsight, on neural signals from rats exploring an open arena and found it was able to precisely predict the position, head direction, and running speed of the animals. Even without manual processing, the results were more accurate than those obtained with conventional analyses.Senior author, Professor Caswell Barry (UCL Cell & Developmental Biology), said:  Existing methods miss a lot of potential information in neural recordings because we can only decode the elements that we already understand. Our network is able to access much more of the neural code and in doing so teaches us to read some of those other elements. We are able to decode neural data more accurately than before, but the real advance is that the network is not constrained by existing knowledge. The team found that their model was able to identify new aspects of the neural code, which they show by detecting a previously unrecognised representation of head direction, encoded by interneurons in a region of the hippocampus that is among the first to show functional defects in people with Alzheimer s disease.Moreover, they show that the same network is able to predict behaviours from different types of recording across brain areas and can also be used to infer hand movements in human participants, which they determined by testing their network on a pre-existing dataset of brain activity recorded in people.Co-author Professor Christian Doeller (Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences) said:  This approach could allow us in the future to predict more accurately higher-level cognitive processes in humans, such as reasoning and problem solving. Markus Frey added:  Our framework enables researchers to get a rapid automated analysis of their unprocessed neural data, saving time which can be spent on only the most promising hypotheses, using more conventional methods.

This research, published recently in Brain Stimulation, has the potential to help millions of people who live with paralysis and neuropathy.Many illnesses and injuries, including stroke, diabetes or spinal cord injury, can produce loss of touch, which makes everyday movements difficult and takes an emotional toll on patients. Imagine not being able to feel a hot cup or the hand holding yours. Previously, through brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, researchers have been able to electrically stimulate certain (gyral) areas of the brain and restore some sensation to the hand. Through this new research, scientists have successfully shown that stimulation of harder to reach (sulcal) areas of the brain using stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes can evoke precise sensory percepts in the fingertips. From buttoning our shirts to holding a loved one s hand, our sense of touch may be taken for granted until we lose it,  said the study s co-principal investigator, Chad Bouton, professor in the Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine at the Feinstein Institutes.  These results show the ability to generate that sensation, even after it is lost, which may lead us to a clinical option in the future. Through a minimally invasive procedure led by neurosurgeon, associate professor in the Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine at the Feinstein Institutes and co-principal investigator on the study, Ashesh Mehta, MD, two patients were implanted with the SEEG electrodes in the sulci (grooves) of the brain. While providing electrical stimulation the study participants reported feelings of  tingling  or  sensation of electricity  localized to the hand and fingertips.The Feinstein Institutes is the global scientific home of bioelectronic medicine, a field of research that combines molecular medicine, neuroscience and biomedical engineering to develop innovative therapies with the aim to treat diseases and conditions through targeted stimulation of nerves, including paralysis, arthritis, pulmonary hypertension and inflammatory bowel disease. Advances in artificial intelligence, brain electrodes and bioelectronic medicine hold significant promise for patients after spinal cord injury or stroke,  said Kevin J. Tracey, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes.  This remarkable study indicates bioelectronic medicine and neurosurgery could restore functions previously lost in these conditions. To research the brain s response, the same electrodes used for stimulation were also used to record neural signals during mechanical stimulation of the hand. This process has allowed researchers to deepen the current knowledge of neural circuitry involved in processing touch-related sensations in the human brain, noted Santosh Chandrasekaran, PhD, investigator in the study and co-lead author on the paper with colleague Stephan Bickel, MD, PhD, also an investigator in the published study.Recent biolectronic medicine progress at the Feinstein Institutes includes a published study around the most effective dose and time of day to stimulate the vagus nerve, a major nerve in the body that controls the body s immune response.Reference: Chandrasekaran S, Bickel S, Herrero JL, et al.

The study estimates the number of lives saved during the first five months of the vaccination campaign in each of the 50 states and Washington, DC.Adjusting for population size, New York saw the largest estimated reduction, with 11.7 fewer COVID-19 deaths per 10,000 adult residents. Hawaii observed the smallest reduction, with 1.1 fewer COVID-19 deaths per 10,000 adult residents.The study, published online by the journal Health Affairs, is one of the first to provide an assessment of the impacts of state-level vaccination campaigns to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This study brings into focus the dramatic success of the early months of the nation's coronavirus vaccine rollout,  said Christopher Whaley, senior author of the study and a policy researcher at RAND, a nonprofit research organization.  The findings provide support for policies that further expand vaccine administration to enable a larger proportion of the nation's population to benefit. The coronavirus pandemic has caused enormous suffering, causing more than 4 million deaths worldwide and more than 600,000 in the United States. While access to and use of vaccines has varied substantially across states and sub-populations during early stages of the vaccine campaign in the United States, COVID-19 case numbers and deaths have fallen sharply since vaccination programs began.Researchers from RAND and Indiana University created models to estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths that would have prevailed in the absence of vaccinations. The difference between the actual number of deaths and those estimates provides a measure of the number of COVID-19 deaths averted by the vaccination campaign.Information about vaccine doses administered in each state came from the Bloomberg COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker, and data on COVID-19 deaths for each state came from The New York Times' Coronavirus (COVID-19) Data in the United States database. The study spanned the period of December 21, 2020, to May 9, 2021.State-level progress in vaccination varied over time. Alaska was the first to reach 20 doses per 100 adults on January 29, 2021, while Alabama was the last on February 21, 2021. On May 6, 2021, California was one of the first to reach 120 doses per 100 adults and many states have still not reached that milestone.The study estimates the economic value of the lives saved during the study period to be between $625 billion and $1.4 trillion. Through the end of 2020, the U.S. federal government had allocated $13 billion dollars for vaccine development and manufacturing. Our results suggest that further efforts to vaccinate populations globally and in a coordinated fashion will be critical to achieving greater control of the COVID-19 pandemic,  said Sumedha Gupta, first author of the study and an economist at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.Reference: Gupta S, Cantor J, Simon KI, Bento AI, Wing C, Whaley CM.

However, in waterways that don t receive treated wastewater, these pollutants aren t expected to be present. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Environmental Science & Technology have found that amounts of some medications carried by a stream in Baltimore were substantial, despite generally low concentrations over the course of a year. Because wastewater plants don t impact this stream, the high loads are likely coming from leaking sewer pipes, they say.Thousands of medications are approved for human use in the U.S., and many of them are harmful to microorganisms, algae and insects when they make their way into lakes and streams through wastewater. The concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds are usually used to determine their impact on organisms living in streams and rivers. However, contaminant concentrations may change quickly from one day to the next, and so singular snapshots do not correctly illustrate their cumulative effects on aquatic life. Instead, load   the mass of a pollutant that passes through a stream or river over time   better represents the risks to downstream environments, where the contaminants end up. While loads are used in regulations for traditional pollutants, such as nutrients, they have not been considered for pharmaceuticals. So, Megan Fork and colleagues wanted to get an idea of the yearly load of medicines transported by an urban stream in Baltimore.The researchers tested water from an urban stream draining into Baltimore s Inner Harbor in Maryland on a weekly basis for a year. At the outflow point, they found 16 pharmaceutical compounds whose presence and amount varied considerably from week to week, ranging from concentrations of parts per trillion to parts per billion. Trimethoprim   an antibiotic   was found most regularly, but acetaminophen   a common pain reliever   was at the highest concentrations. The team used their weekly measurements to estimate annual loads of pharmaceuticals, calculating that the equivalent of 30,000 doses of antidepressants, 1,700 doses of antibiotics and 30,000 tablets of acetaminophen entered the Inner Harbor through the stream. Interestingly, this watershed did not receive wastewater treatment plant effluent, so it s likely these compounds are coming from leaky sewer pipes. Improvements to aging infrastructure could reduce this source of harmful compounds to urban streams and other waterways, the researchers say.Reference: Fork ML, Fick JB, Reisinger AJ, Rosi EJ.

The study looks at a species of flesh fly called Sarcophaga similis, but the results could be applicable to any animal species that relies on predictable environmental signals for biological processes like growth, reproductive behavior, sleep, and migration , said Assistant Professor Ayumu Mukai of Setsunan University and lead author of the study. In collaboration with Professor Shin Goto of Osaka City University, their findings were published in Royal Society Open Science. A common way of exploring the ecological effects of urbanization is to investigate changes in life cycles of species in the urban and surrounding area. Urban warming and artificial light at night are two of the most influential factors in this regard. As urban warming can increase surface temperatures anywhere between 5 - 9 C, species with lower critical thermal optima, i.e. biological processes such as growth and development that occur at lower environmental temperatures, are disproportionately affected. Due to large fluctuations throughout the day and year, temperature can be an unreliable cue for species to determine when to sleep, breed, migrate, etc., rendering this cue supplemental to a biological response to seasonal changes by monitoring day length   an ability called photoperiodism. Increased nighttime light can throw off an insect s photoperiodism, yet few studies have focused on the effect urban warming and artificial light at night have had on insects in their natural habitat.  Recognizing the conditions urbanization brings upon insects where they actually live would be a great step forward in mitigating any negative effects , Shin Goto said. To understand this, the team conducted experiments indoors and outdoors. As S. similis typically enters hibernation during autumn, laboratory hibernation was induced in flies under two average October temperatures (20 C and 15 C), with varying levels of illuminance to mimic bright urban to dark rural areas. They found that the percentage of flies entering hibernation decreased as illumination increased and as the temperature increased from 15 C to 20 C   suggesting the higher temperatures found in urban areas are associated with higher nighttime illumination. In the field, the team measured when the insects entered hibernation in two city locations: a site with nighttime lighting at around 0.2 lux (the brightness of a full moon in a clear sky), and another with nighttime lighting at around 6 lux, which is equivalent to a residential area or street at night. At sites with dark nights, most flies enter hibernation between October and November while at sites with increased nighttime light, they did not enter hibernation until after November. The team also compared urban areas with illumination of about 0.2 lux with rural areas of almost 0 lux. The percentages of flies entering hibernation in rural areas increased from late September, around 3 weeks earlier than their urban counterparts. Temperatures were also 2.5 C higher in the cities, which is thought to be the cause for the delay in hibernation. While these findings do suggest that nighttime lighting, which supports our daily lives, is disrupting the seasonality of insects,  urban environments are complex, with nighttime illumination and temperatures varying within the same neighborhood and between different cities , Ayumu Mukai pointed out,  and our work on a single flesh fly does not elucidate the photoperiodic response of other insects.  To understand the extent to which our cultural life influences other organisms, Shin Goto continued,  Future studies with a variety of insect species at different sites, in cities with different climatic regions would clarify what levels of light pollution and urban warming affect insect seasonal adaptation.

Will it know how to associate colour with reward? And if we change species, will it learn the same? Birds and primates have shown that species with bigger brains are smarter, they learn better. Now, the scientific study Brain size predicts learning abilities in bees led by CREAF and the CSIC Do ana Biological Station shows for the first time that this theory also holds true in bees. Bee species with larger brains, both in absolute terms and relative to body size, have a greater capacity for learning.Miguel  ngel Collado, researcher at the Do ana Biological Station (CSIC) and CREAF carried out the experiment that corroborates this statement. He performed the test 7 times, changing the position of the strips, with each of the 120 bees collected in fields and gardens in Andalusia, so that they would learn to associate colour with reward. Of the 16 different bee species in total, he found that most species learn to associate a colour with a reward, but those with larger brains do better than those with smaller brains. Confirming that the theory holds true in invertebrates is an important step. Although their brains are smaller and simpler than those of vertebrates, we know that there is a huge variation in size between species and that this can greatly influence their ability to adapt to environmental changes, according to Miguel  ngel Collado.

The investigators hope that the advance, which is described in Nature Communications, will help bring them closer to achieving their goal of using patients  cells to generate functioning heart tissue that could be transplanted, similar to donor organs, for the treatment of heart failure.The cells, called pre-epicardial cells, form the epicardium, a membrane that covers the outer surface of the heart. This membrane generates a variety of cells needed to support heart development before birth. Harald Ott, MD, a thoracic surgeon at MGH and an associate professor in surgery at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues developed a recipe to generate pre-epicardial cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which are embryo-like cells derived from reprogrammed mature cells such as a patient s skin cells.When placed in contact with heart muscle cells (or cardiomyocytes), the pre-epicardial cells developed further to become epicardial cells and took on their important role of supporting embryonic heart formation--for example, by enhancing the maturation of nearby cardiomyocytes.Ott notes that scientists are able to retrace early stages of heart development and generate millions of cardiomyocytes from a single blood draw, but forming the structure of the heart is very complex.  It has been difficult to retrace later stages of tissue development due to the many cell types involved and the complexity of the three-dimensional environment of the developing heart,  he explains.  Our study introduces a cell type that is much closer to later stages of human cardiac development than what we have been able to generate so far. Producing cells that play key roles in forming the structure of the heart is necessary for regenerative medicine strategies for heart disease.  While there are many more steps still required to complete the puzzle of heart development, this work adds an important piece that will hopefully help us and others in recapitulating cardiac development to generate novel therapies for heart failure,  says Ott. He envisions that such cell- or tissue-based therapies will provide  on demand  treatments to restore or replace lost organ function in patients suffering from chronic organ failure such as heart failure, end stage lung disease, and kidney disease.Reference: Tan JJ, Guyette JP, Miki K, et al.

The study from Link ping University, Sweden, has been published in the journal Animal Behaviour.More impulsive individuals are more likely to respond rapidly to situations without planning or considering the consequences. In many species, including humans, impulsivity differs between individuals, but we do not yet understand why this is, as research into what lies behind these differences is limited. Variation in impulsivity is especially puzzling, because individuals with high impulsivity can suffer negative consequences, such as taking risks without considering the outcome. We expect natural selection over time to favour behaviour that benefits the individual, so why do we regularly observe individuals who are considerably more impulsive than others?  asks Hanne L vlie, associate professor in the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology at Link ping University, who led the study.The LiU researchers looked in more detail at how impulsivity could be influenced by underlying factors. They studied the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), the ancestor of our domestic chickens and a frequently used species for studies on behavioural differences and cognition, measuring animal  intelligence .To investigate whether junglefowl chicks differed in impulsivity, the researchers used an already established test in which a reward (a mealworm) is placed inside a transparent tube. The impulsive response is to try to reach the reward directly through the solid, transparent side of the tube, even though this is not possible. To get the mealworm, a chick must instead curb its impulsivity and remember what it has previously learnt   that it can reach the reward from the open end of the tube. The researchers counted how many times each chick pecked at the transparent tube trying to get the reward, which is a measure of how impulsive they were. By repeating the experiment several times, the researchers also measured how well each chick learnt to reduce its impulsivity.The scientists wanted to see how early experiences could influence impulsivity. Before testing how impulsive chicks were, they assigned each chick at random to one of three treatments. In one treatment, chicks received training which aimed to improve their cognitive abilities, resulting in  cognitively enriched  chicks. Chicks in the second treatment were permitted to interact with the cognitive testing equipment, but were not trained themselves, and were thus  environmentally enriched  (but not cognitively enriched). Chicks in the third treatment did not receive any enrichment while growing up.The results showed that these differences in early experience did indeed affect impulsivity in the junglefowl chicks, but not in the manner that was expected. Intriguingly, cognitively enriched chicks, who had been trained to pass other cognitive tests, were more impulsive than the other chicks. This goes against our initial expectations but is compatible with our finding that environmentally enriched chicks were slower to learn to reduce impulsivity. Thus, all chicks that received enrichment were less able to curb their impulsivity. Our results support discoveries from earlier studies that suggest that enrichment can increase impulsivity, and highlight the potential role of cognitive enrichment , says Laura Garnham, PhD student at LiU and one of the researchers behind the study.Variation between individuals was also influenced by brain gene expression. The scientists investigated the levels of expression of several genes that are involved in two important brain signalling systems, the serotonin system and the dopamine system, which in other species have been linked to impulsive behaviour. We found that impulsivity correlated with the expression of one gene linked to the signalling molecule serotonin, and two genes linked to the signalling molecule dopamine. This shows us that not only differences in experience, but also genetic factors can contribute to differences in impulsivity between individuals , says Sara Ryding, who worked in the study while on an exchange visit from the University of Manchester. Sara is now a PhD student at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.Reference: Ryding S, Garnham LC, Abbey-Lee RN, Petkova I, Kreshchenko A, L vlie H.

The latest decision means the drugs will now be routinely available on the NHS.Ben Chiu, policy manager at CRUK, said it is  brilliant news  that people affected by this type of breast cancer will continue to have this treatment available to them.Cancer Research UK scientists laid the foundations for its development over 30 years ago. Abemaciclib is type of drug called a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6). It works by blocking proteins in cancer cells which allow the cancer to divide and grow.Human versions of cyclin-dependent kinases were discovered by Paul Nurse, a Cancer Research UK scientist at the London Research Institute (LRI). For this discovery, Nurse was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 2001, along with his colleague Tim Hunt and a US researcher called Leland Hartwell, who first identified cyclin dependent kinases in yeast. According to Meindert Boysen, director of the Centre for Health and Technology evaluation at NICE, people with this form of advanced breast cancer would at this stage usually be treated with exemestane plus everolimus.However, this combination has been found to be poorly tolerated by patients and was only used for a small number of patients because it had similar effects to chemotherapy on quality of life.But following the NICE decision, patients will now be able to access abemaciclib as a treatment option. The drug will be available to patients whose advanced hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body after receiving endocrine therapy.Clinical trials did not directly compare abemaciclib plus fulvestrant with exemestane plus everolimus. However, an indirect comparison suggests that people having abemaciclib plus fulvestrant have longer before their disease worsens and live longer than people taking exemestane plus everolimus.During the consultation period, experts heard the value to patients of having this drug as a treatment option, as it is an alternative to other drugs and has different side effects.Boysen said:  Advanced breast cancer is an incurable condition and the aim of treatment is to delay it getting worse and extend survival. The committee heard that CDK4/6 inhibitors like abemaciclib were welcomed by patients because they can delay the time before their cancer gets worse and so delay or avoid the need for chemotherapy.  Draft guidance from NICE in February did not support routine use in England as it had not been deemed cost-effective. But on the basis of an improved patient access scheme and economic modelling data provided by the makers Eli Lilly, the NICE committee decided that abemaciclib could be recommended as a cost-effective use of NHS resources.It will now progress from being temporarily available on the Cancer Drugs Fund to routine commissioning.Chiu noted:  It shows how important the Cancer Drugs Fund is in providing cancer patients with new treatment options for their disease. Wales and Northern Ireland typically follow NICE recommendations, so the combination is likely to be available in these nations too. Scotland has its own regulatory approval process through the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC).Reference: NICE draft guidance recommends abemaciclib for advanced breast cancer.

CAR T-Cell therapy has been hailed by patients, clinical-researchers, investors, and the media as a viable cure for some cancers.CAR T-Cell therapy involves engineering a patient s T-cells, a type of white blood cell, in a lab. Then a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is added, and these customized immune cells are returned to the patient s body, where they seek and destroy cancer cells. That s how it works, when it works.It s a new, evolving, and booming area of immunotherapy, with more than 500 clinical trials analyzing CAR T-cells for cancer treatment going on right now around the world. These therapies have proven to be remarkably effective for patients with liquid tumors   so, tumors that are circulating in the blood, such as leukemia,  said Gabe Kwong, associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory.  Unfortunately, for solid tumors   sarcomas, carcinomas   they don t work well. There are many different reasons why. One huge problem is that the CAR T-cells are immunosuppressed by the tumor microenvironment. Kwong and his collaborators are changing the environment and making some cell modifications of their own to enhance the way CAR T-cells fight cancer. They ve added a genetic on-off switch to the cells and a developed a remote-control system that sends the modified T-cells on a precision invasion of the tumor microenvironment, where they kill the tumor and prevent a relapse. And they explain it all in a study published recently in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.The latest study builds on the lab s body of work exploring remotely controlled cell therapies, in which the researchers can precisely target tumors, wherever they are in the body, with a local deposition of heat.  And this heat basically activates the CAR T-cells inside the tumors, overcoming the problems of immunosuppression,  said Kwong.In the earlier study, the researchers did not clinically treat tumors, but they are doing that now with the new work. To generate heat in a mouse s tumor, they shone laser pulses from outside the animal s body, onto the spot where a tumor is located. Gold nanorods delivered to the tumor turn the light waves into localized, mild heat, raising the temperature to 40-42 Celsius (104-107.6 F), just enough to activate the T-Cells  on-switch, but not so hot that it would damage healthy tissue, or the T-cells. Once turned on, the cells go to work, increasing the expression of cancer-fighting proteins.The real novelty, Kwong said, was in genetically engineering clinical-grade CAR T-Cells, something the team worked on for the past three years. Now, in addition to a switch that responds to heat, the researchers have added a few upgrades to the T-cells, rewiring them to produce molecules to stimulate the immune system.Localized production of these potent, engineered proteins (cytokines and Bispecific T-cell Engagers) has to be controlled precisely. These cancer-fighting proteins are really good at stimulating CAR T-cells, but they are too toxic to be used outside of tumors,  said Kwong.  They are too toxic to be delivered systemically. But with our approach we can localize these proteins safely. We get all the benefits without the drawbacks. The latest study shows the system cured cancer in mice, and the team s approach not only shrunk tumors but prevented relapse   critical for long-term survival. Further studies will delve into additional tailoring of T-cells, as well as how heat will be deposited at the tumor site. A gentle laser was used to heat the tumor site. That won t be the case when the technology moves on to human studies. We ll use focused ultrasound, which is completely non-invasive and can target any site in the body,  Kwong said.  One of the limitations with laser is that it doesn t penetrate very far in the body. So, if you have a deep-seated malignant tumor, that would be a problem. We want to eliminate problems.

New research published this week in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, explores the role of nasal bacteria and provides clues to developing better intranasal vaccines for flu and COVID-19. ""Our study shows that both integrity and amounts of nasal bacteria may be critical for effective intranasal vaccine,"" said study principal investigator Takeshi Ichinohe, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Division of Viral Infection, Department of Infectious Disease Control, International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan. ""We showed that oral bacteria-combined intranasal vaccine protects from influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection.""In the new study, to determine the effects of nasal bacteria in the induction of mucosal immune responses to influenza virus infection, Dr. Ichniohe and colleagues treated mice intranasally with an antibiotic cocktail to kill the nasal bacteria before influenza virus infection. The researchers found that disruption of nasal bacteria by antibiotics before influenza virus infection enhanced the virus-specific antibody responses. ""We found that intranasal application of antibiotics (to kill nasal bacteria) could release bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), which are bacterial components that stimulate innate immunity that act as mucosal adjuvants for influenza virus-specific antibodies response,"" said Dr. Ichniohe.  Innate immunity, which is not specific to a particular pathogen, is the first line of defense against non-self pathogens such as bacteria and virus. The main purpose of the innate immune response is to immediately prevent the spread and movement of foreign pathogens throughout the body. The innate immune responses play an essential role for inducing the pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. Adjuvants are substances that increase or modulate the immune response to a vaccine and stimulate the innate immune system. The researchers also found that while the upper respiratory tract contained commensal bacteria, relative amounts of culturable commensal bacteria in nasal mucosal surface were significantly lower than that in the oral cavity. The researchers tested whether intranasal supplementation of cultured oral bacteria enhances antibody responses to intranasally administered vaccine and found that oral bacteria combined with intranasal vaccine increased antibody responses to intranasally administered vaccine.  Dr. Ichniohe said the findings provide clues to developing better intranasal vaccines.

Other variants of concern, such as beta, avoided recognition and neutralization by several of the antibodies.The findings, published Aug. 16 in the journal Immunity, help explain why vaccinated people have largely escaped the worst of the delta surge.In previous studies, co-senior author Ali Ellebedy, PhD, an associate professor of pathology & immunology, of medicine and of molecular microbiology, had shown that both natural infection and vaccination elicit lasting antibody production. But the length of the antibody response is only one aspect of protection. The breadth matters, too. An ideal antibody response includes a diverse set of antibodies with the flexibility to recognize many slightly different variants of the virus. Breadth confers resilience. Even if a few antibodies lose the ability to recognize a new variant, other antibodies in the arsenal should remain capable of neutralizing it. The fact that delta has outcompeted other variants does not mean that it s more resistant to our antibodies compared to other variants,  said co-senior author Jacco Boon, PhD, an associate professor of medicine, of molecular microbiology and of pathology & immunology.  The ability of a variant to spread is the sum of many factors. Resistance to antibodies is just one factor. Another one is how well the variant replicates. A variant that replicates better is likely to spread faster, independent of its ability to evade our immune response. So delta is surging, yes, but there s no evidence that it is better at overcoming vaccine-induced immunity compared to other variants. To assess the breadth of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Ellebedy and colleagues   including co-first authors Aaron Schmitz, PhD, a research specialist; Jackson S. Turner, PhD, an instructor in pathology & immunology; and Zhuoming Liu, PhD, a staff scientist   extracted antibody-producing cells from three people who had received the Pfizer vaccine. They grew the cells in the laboratory and obtained from them a set of 13 antibodies that target the original strain that began circulating last year.The researchers tested the antibodies against four variants of concern: alpha, beta, gamma and delta. Twelve of the 13 recognized alpha and delta, eight recognized all four variants, and one failed to recognize any of the four variants.Scientists gauge an antibody s usefulness by its ability to block virus from infecting and killing cells in a dish. So-called neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection are thought to be more powerful than antibodies that recognize the virus but can t block infection, although both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies contribute to defending the body.The researchers found that five of the 13 antibodies neutralized the original strain. When they tested the neutralizing antibodies against the new variants, all five antibodies neutralized delta, three neutralized alpha and delta, and only one neutralized all four variants. In face of vaccination, delta is relatively a wimpy virus,  Ellebedy said.  If we had a variant that was more resistant like beta but spread as easily as delta, we d be in more trouble. The antibody that neutralized all four variants of concern   as well as three additional variants tested separately   was called 2C08. In animal experiments, 2C08 also protected hamsters from disease caused by every variant tested: the original variant, delta and a mimic of beta.Some people may have antibodies just as powerful as 2C08 protecting them against SARS-CoV-2 and its many variants, Ellebedy said. Using publicly available databases, the researchers discovered that about 20% of people infected or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 create antibodies that recognize the same spot on the virus that is targeted by 2C08. Moreover, very few virus variants (.008%) carry mutations that allow them to escape antibodies targeting that spot. This antibody is not unique to the person we got it from,  Ellebedy said.  Multiple antibodies targeting this area have been described in the literature; at least one is under development as a COVID-19 therapy. Similar antibodies have been generated by people infected in Italy and people infected in China and people vaccinated in New York. So it s not limited to people of certain backgrounds or ethnicities; it s not generated only by vaccination or by infection. A lot of people make this antibody, which is great because it is very potent and neutralizes every variant we tested. Reference: Schmitz AJ, Turner JS, Liu Z, et al.

Pregnant people do well with the vaccine,  added lead author Dr. Alisa Kachikis.The findings come a week after the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention formally recommended that all pregnant women get vaccinated against the virus. The CDC reported that only 23% of U.S. pregnant women were vaccinated as of the end of July. The percentage is even lower among Black and Latina women.  We hope that this data will be another reassuring piece of information ... about why pregnant individuals need to get vaccinated against COVID-19,"" Eckert said. Not only is the vaccine safe, our research shows just how well the vaccine is tolerated in pregnant individuals which is a common fear I hear from my patients.  In contrast, we are continuing to learn more and more about just how dangerous COVID-19 infections are in pregnancy.""In January 2021, Kachikis set up an online cohort study of women: those who were pregnant or lactating and those who were neither pregnant nor lactating. The women were invited to describe their reactions after receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. By March, 17,525 individuals had responded.The respondents comprised women who were pregnant (44%) or lactating (38%) and those who stated plans to get pregnant in the near future (15%).The majority (62%) received the Pfizer vaccine and most of the participants resided in the United States. Respondents reported pain at the injection site (91%) and fatigue (31%), and a mean temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit after the shot. A small group (5-7%) reported a decrease in milk supply post-vaccination.The study supports that women tolerate the vaccine well and that they should be included in clinical trials for other relevant vaccines, Eckert said. I m not surprised but I am pleased by the outcome. It s further evidence that the vaccine is safe and well-tolerated in pregnant individuals. There are currently 20,000 women enrolled in the study and new respondents continue to post their experiences, Kachikis added.The researchers hope to expand the study to other socioeconomic groups and to women not so closely tied to heathcare, as this group was, Eckert said. I think this gives a level of evidence to advocate for Phase 3 trials (for pregnant individuals) in the future,  Eckert said.Aside from the CDC vsafe registery, this is the largest U.S. study of this issue.

Now, a study led by scientists at UCLA could elucidate how and why that phenomenon occurs.In the experiment, which was conducted with mice, researchers found that gut microbes can exacerbate the effects of cognitive impairment because of how they affect the hippocampus, the region of the brain that is critical for memory and learning. They found that the concentration of one group of bacteria called Bilophila increased dramatically in the gut microbiota of mice fed that were fed a ketogenic diet   high in fat, and low in carbohydrates   and were intermittently deprived of oxygen, creating a condition called hypoxia.The scientists also found that a ketogenic diet, hypoxia and treatment with a species of Bilophila called Bilophila wadsworthia impaired the hippocampus, leading to reduced cognitive ability in mice.The research is published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell Host & Microbe.The researchers gave several mice a ketogenic diet and others a standard diet. Then, all of the mice received reduced levels of oxygen for five consecutive days and then were given four days to recover. Depriving the animals of some oxygen was a way for the scientists to cause cognitive impairment, in order to mimic the cognitive impairment in humans that can be caused by neurological diseases or aging.Next, the scientists observed their ability to navigate a maze. When trying to find their way out of a maze, mice on the ketogenic diet made an average of 30% more errors than mice given the standard diet. (The range of difference between the two groups was 25% to 75%.)The researchers also evaluated whether the different diets alone could cause any change in cognitive behavior in mice who had not been deprived of oxygen. In that experiment, there was no appreciable difference in the mice s ability to find their way out of the maze based on whether they had a ketogenic diet or a standard diet   indicating that the negative impact on cognitive ability only occurred in combination with oxygen deprivation. These results highlight the ability of different environmental factors to interact together to impact cognitive behavior in mice,  said lead author Christine Olson, a UCLA graduate student.Next, the researchers investigated what would happen if they depleted the mice s microbiota before administering a ketogenic diet and exposing them to hypoxia. Interestingly, mice that had their microbiota depleted first made significantly fewer errors in the maze than mice that were exposed to hypoxia and given a ketogenic diet but had not had changes to their microbiota first. This suggests that the microbes associated with the ketogenic diet and hypoxia could contribute to the detrimental effects on cognitive impairment,  Olson said.The authors determined that Bilophila wadsworthia changes which genes are turned on or off in the hippocampus, and that the bacterium reduces normal cellular signaling in the hippocampus. Bilophila wadsworthia disrupted hippocampal activity and cognitive behavior in ways similar to how hypoxia and the ketogenic diet together did,  Olson said. She added that given the hippocampus s important role in learning and memory, the changes offer clues for how Bilophila influences cognitive behavior.Scientists are just now uncovering microbial species that can affect behavioral changes in mice and other animals, Hsiao said. She added that it will be important to study more specifically how microbial species can affect the brain   for example, through cellular changes that occur in response to microbes.Cognitive impairment afflicts millions of people over age 65 and is associated with a wide variety of chronic metabolic, immunological and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer s disease. Elaine Hsiao, UCLA s De Logi Professor of Biological Sciences and an associate professor of digestive diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said the new study could be an important step toward learning which microbes affect or impair cognitive ability. Identifying early risk factors is critical to enabling early detection and interventions for cognitive impairment,  said Hsiao, the paper s senior author.Hsiao added that more research is needed to determine whether other gut microbes besides Bilophila might also affect cognitive ability and whether the microbiota could influence cognitive decline in humans.Reference: Olson CA, I iguez AJ, Yang GE, et al.

If replicated in humans, the findings   which identify histamine as a  new molecule of interest  in depression   could open new avenues for treating depression, which is the most common mental health problem worldwide.Inflammation   a blanket term describing an immune response   triggers the release of histamine in the body. This increases blood flow to affected areas to flood them with immune cells. While these effects help the body fight infections, both long-term and acute inflammation is increasingly linked to depression. Inflammation accompanies infections but can also be caused by stress, allergic responses and a host of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.Lead author Dr Parastoo Hashemi, from Imperial s Department of Bioengineering, said:  Inflammation could play a huge role in depression, and there is already strong evidence that patients with both depression and severe inflammation are the ones most likely not to respond to antidepressants. Our work shines a spotlight on histamine as a potential key player in depression. This, and its interactions with the  feel-good molecule  serotonin, may thus be a crucial new avenue in improving serotonin-based treatments for depression.

Cells divide rapidly, and random mutations accumulate at a correspondingly high rate. Since many of these genetic changes alter the properties of the cells that carry them, their effects soon become fixed features of the genome. Bacteria also make use of various modes of genetic exchange, which enables recombination between diverse genomes. This process serves to mitigate the effects of deleterious mutations, while allowing favorable mutations that confer beneficial traits to be propagated. In addition, environmental factors such as the presence of antibiotics exert selective pressures that further contribute to bacterial evolution.The type of genetic exchange and mode of evolution outlined above is common for bacteria in terrestrial habitats like soil and in the oceans. But in the deep sea, bacteria can also be found at depths of more than 10 m below the seafloor where they persist under extreme energy limitation, close to the energy limit to life, in sediments that more than one million years old. In these settings nearly all the nutrients are consumed at the seafloor surface leaving extremely low food supply for the bacteria that persist deep below the seafloor. Can cells in such an extreme and ancient setting continue to divide and evolve?  Some scientists have posed the hypothesis that the rates of cellular division are too slow and evolution cannot take place under such conditions,  says Professor William Orsi, geomicrobiologist in the Paleontology & Geobiology Section of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich, and a member of the GeoBio Center. The rationale for this assessment is based on the fact that the extreme energy limitation that bacterial populations face in ancient sediments several meters below the seafloor results in very low rates of metabolism, and should therefore bacteria will divide very slowly   or possibly not at all. Under such conditions, the slow rate of growth and the speed at which new traits can spread through populations may simply be too slow to allow evolution to happen.The theory seems plausible. But a new study shows that in fact evolution does indeed take place under these rather peculiar environmental conditions, as an LMU team led by Orsi, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Arizona and colleagues at the LMU have now shown. The study was conceived more than five years ago, when William Orsi and Gert W rheide (who holds the Chair of Paleontology and Geobiology at LMU) conceived an idea to test the hypothesis that evolution is actually possible deep below the surface of the Earth. After Orsi had isolated bacteria belonging to the genus Thalassospira from samples of sub-seafloor sediments that were several millions of years old, they went on to analyze the genomes of the bacteria. They discovered that the genomes were characterized by the presence of a relatively high proportion of  pseudogenes . Pseudogenes are the descendants of formerly functional genes that have acquired so many mutations over the course of time that they are effectively inactivated.This finding implies that these bacteria have a tendency to accumulate deleterious mutations, which can ultimately lead to loss of the original functions of these genes. Moreover, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Montreal, the LMU team discovered that the subseafloor Thalassospira bacteria genomes exhibited ten times lower levels of genetic recombination compared to surface world bacteria. The lack of recombination from neighboring bacteria resulted in newly acquired errors becoming fixed in the genomes of the subseafloor bacteria and can be passed on when the cells divided. Physical isolation from the surface world therefore resulted in genetic isolation. In the long term, these genetically isolated subseafloor organisms become established as idiosyncratic subtypes of their respective species that were buried in the sediments millions of years ago. A similar phenomenon has been observed in endosymbiotic bacteria, which live within the cells of other species,  says Orsi. Unlike free-living species, endosymbionts are genetically isolated, and little or no recombination takes place, so random mutations can pile up, giving rise to what is known as  genetic drift . Purifying selection cannot take place, and genes are gradually inactivated, altered beyond recognition and ultimately lost.  The fact that we have found clear indications for comparable evolutionary mechanisms in bacteria recovered from sub-seafloor sediments suggests that such evolutionary processes occur in free-living bacteria far more often than we have hitherto assumed,  Orsi concludes.Reference: Orsi WD, Magritsch T, Vargas S, et al.

Half of these were 10-12 months old - not-quite adult, and the other half were in old age at 22-24 months - equivalent to humans in their 90s. Cuttlefish can remember what they ate, where and when, and use this to guide their feeding decisions in the future. What s surprising is that they don t lose this ability with age, despite showing other signs of ageing like loss of muscle function and appetite,  said Dr Alexandra Schnell in the University of Cambridge s Department of Psychology, first author of the paper.As humans age, we gradually lose the ability to remember experiences that happened at particular times and places   for example, what we had for dinner last Tuesday. This is termed  episodic memory , and its decline is thought to be due to deterioration of a part of the brain called the hippocampus.Cuttlefish do not have a hippocampus, and their brain structure is dramatically different to ours. The  vertical lobe  of the cuttlefish brain is associated with learning and memory. This does not deteriorate until the last two to three days of the animal s life, which the researchers say could explain why episodic-like memory is not affected by age in cuttlefish.To conduct the experiment, the cuttlefish were first trained to approach a specific location in their tank marked with a black and white flag. Then they were trained to learn that two foods they commonly eat were available at specific flag-marked locations and after specific delays. At one spot, the flag was waved and a piece of king prawn, their less preferred food, was provided. Live grass shrimp, which they like more, was provided at a different spot where another flag was also waved - but only every three hours. This was repeated for four weeks.Then the cuttlefishes  recall of which food would be available, where, and when was tested. To make sure they hadn t just learned a pattern, the two feeding locations were unique each day. All the cuttlefish - regardless of age - watched which food first appeared at each flag and used that to work out which feeding spot was best at each subsequent flag-waving. This suggests that episodic-like memory does not decline with age in cuttlefish, unlike in humans. The old cuttlefish were just as good as the younger ones in the memory task   in fact, many of the older ones did better in the test phase. We think this ability might help cuttlefish in the wild to remember who they mated with, so they don t go back to the same partner,  said Schnell.Cuttlefish only breed at the end of their life. By remembering who they mated with, where, and how long ago, the researchers think this helps the cuttlefish to spread their genes widely by mating with as many partners as possible.Cuttlefish have short lifespans   most live until around two years old   making them a good subject to test whether memory declines with age. Since it is impossible to test whether animals are consciously remembering things, the authors used the term  episodic-like memory  to refer to the ability of cuttlefish to remember what, where and when specific things happened.Reference:Schnell AK, Clayton NS, Hanlon RT, Jozet-Alves C.

Also, allergen molecules were better diagnostic tools for predicting allergic symptoms to tree nuts compared with analyzing allergen extracts. Tree nuts include hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans, cashews, pistachios, almonds, and brazil nuts.  This study increases the understanding of tree nut allergy in a general population, followed from infancy up to adulthood.

While wind and solar dominate the renewable market, they are available only 20-30% of the time,  Wang said. Wave energy is available 90% of the time on average and the potential power contained in offshore waves is immense. Our prototype technology overcomes some of the key technical challenges that have been holding back the wave energy industry from large-scale deployment. With further development, we hope this technology could be the foundation for a thriving new renewable energy industry delivering massive environmental and economic benefits.

But the process can deregulate and give rise to disease. Byproducts of errant processes can build up like gunk in the gears, especially around neurons, breaking down the repair mechanisms and causing further damage and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease.Now, an international research team may have found that a protein implicated in tumor growth may be able to help regulate awry cellular translation and protect against neuronal decay. They published their results on July 13 in the Cell Reports. Researchers have begun to understand that age-related neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by slow but steady accumulation of toxic peptide products, which leads to death of neurons, such as beta-amyloid plaques causing Alzheimer s disease,  said lead paper author Katsura Asano, professor in Hiroshima University s Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life and also in Division of Biology, Kansas State University.  Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation is one of the mechanisms that generates such toxic products. When replicating their genetic material, cells look for specifically ordered markers that signal the spot where they should start and end the copy to make a specific protein. The signal is typically  AUG,  but RAN translation doesn t need this signal and can begin processing at other points. The problem is that RAN translation can end up copying bits of repeated genetic information that become the toxic buildup that leads to neurodegeneration. Taking advantage of our knowledge on translation, we examined whether the translational regulatory protein 5MP can suppress RAN translation, which would also suppress the production of the toxic repeat peptide products,  Asano said.In diseased conditions, 5MP is a protein that can potentially transform a healthy cell into a tumor cell. In healthy conditions, 5MP mimics a protein involved in regulating RAN translation. The researchers used electron microscopy and computer-directed modeling to reveal the structure of the preinitiation complex of molecules that assemble prior to RAN translation beginning. They found that 5MP competes with the protein it mimics in human cells and, when it wins, it reduces RAN translation and its toxic byproducts.To better understand how this finding translates to disease outcomes, the researchers engineered flies with fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder. They found that increasing the levels of 5MP in the affected flies repressed neuronal toxicity and enhanced their lifespan.     Taken together, these data suggest that modulation of 5MP levels could be a viable therapeutic target by which to selectively reduce RAN translation in repeat expansion disorders,  Asano said.  More studies on 5MP and the mechanism of translation can greatly contribute to the understanding and care of neurodegenerative diseases. Reference:Singh CR, Glineburg MR, Moore C, et al.

It has several important functions within the body, but it is primarily known for promoting calcium absorption, which makes it a vital nutrient for bone health.In a paper published by The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Surrey s researchers conducted a systematic review of the vitamin D and dietary intakes of members of the black community across the globe. The findings suggest that people of African descent should consider taking vitamin D supplements and consume more vitamin D rich foods.The researchers found that when looking at black individuals who live in low latitude countries (such as Brazil and South Africa), there was vitamin D sufficiency. However, in those who live at higher latitudes, such as in the UK, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was common.The Surrey researchers' findings suggest that awareness of vitamin D deficiency needs to be highlighted in African-Caribbean populations, especially those living in countries like the UK where low dietary vitamin D intake was prevalent.Rebecca Vearing, PhD research student from the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Surrey, said:  As the majority of our vitamin D comes from exposure to sunlight, for many people getting enough vitamin D may be a real challenge. This research shows that eating a nutritionally balanced diet including foods that provide vitamin D -- such as oily fish, red meat, egg yolk and fortified foods such as breakfast cereals -- and taking regular supplements are key to boosting vitamin D status. These findings are supported by a second paper from Surrey published by The Journal of Nutrition, where researchers studied how vitamin D supplements and sunlight exposure affect the health of Brazilian women living in both the UK and Brazil.*This first-of-its-kind study examined two groups of the same ethnic identity and sex, living in different countries in an identical way and looked at whether supplements or sunlight altered the vitamin D status of its participants.Researchers studied 120 healthy Brazilian women in parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials conducted at different latitudes in Brazil and England. Participants were chosen randomly to receive a daily vitamin D supplement or placebo for 12 weeks during the wintertime.Researchers found that although vitamin D dietary requirements may vary considerably between participants in each country, a moderate dose of vitamin D supplementation is a remarkably effective strategy for raising and maintaining adequate vitamin D levels over the winter months in both the UK and Brazil.The participants with the lowest initial vitamin D levels had the most significant increases in response to vitamin D supplements.Overall, the study found that the effect of vitamin D supplements is not dependent on latitude.Dr Marcela Mendes, visiting research fellow from the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Surrey, said:  Our research looks at different ethnic groups, and our findings show that people might benefit from increasing consumption of foods that naturally contain vitamin D or are fortified with it, or even taking an additional supplement, in the autumn and winter, regardless of where they live.

The findings are important to better understand how reef-building corals and other reef animals protect themselves from foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses found in and around coral reefs.The researchers found that immune cells make up about three percent of the total cell population and that they have at least two populations of immune cells that perform functions unique from digestion.  These findings are important because they show that corals have the cellular capabilities to fight infection and that they have unique cell types that were previously not known,  said Nikki Traylor-Knowles, an assistant professor of marine biology and ecology at the UM Rosenstiel School and co-senior author of the study. To uncover these specialized immune cells, the researchers exposed foreign particles such as bacteria, fungal antigens, and beads into a cauliflower coral (Pocillopora damicornis) and starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) in the laboratory. They then used a process, called fluorescence-activated cell sorting, to isolate different cell populations. They found that specialized cells, known as phagocytic cells, engulfed the foreign particles, while small, fluid-filled structures inside the cells, called phagosomes, worked to destroy the invaders as well as their own damaged cells. Immune systems in animals provide an important protective defense response to recognize and destroy foreign substances in their tissues.  We need to have a better understanding of how coral cells perform specialized functions such as fight infections as the climate change crisis drastically reduces global coral reef biomass and diversity worldwide,  said Traylor-Knowles.

It  contains primarily acetate and the sugars glucose and xylose, all of which are released during decomposition.In a paper published in Nature Communications, the team described its work, which offers a viable method for overcoming one of the major hurdles impeding the commercialization of lignocellulosic biofuels   the toxicity of acetate to fermenting microbes such as yeast. This is the first approach to demonstrate the efficient and complete utilization of xylose and acetate for the production of biofuel,  said food science and human nutrition professor Yong-Su Jin. An affiliate of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, Jin led the research with then-graduate student Liang Sun, the first author of the paper.Their methodology fully utilized the xylose and acetate from the cell walls of switchgrass, transforming the acetate from an unwanted byproduct into a valuable substrate that boosted the yeast s efficiency at converting the sugars in the hydrosolates. We figured out that we can use what s been considered a toxic, useless substance as a supplementary carbon source with xylose to economically produce fine chemicals  such as triacetic acid lactone, or TAL, and vitamin A, which are derived from the same precursor molecule, acetyl coenzyme A, Jin said.TAL is a versatile platform chemical currently obtained by refining petroleum and is used to produce plastics and food ingredients, said Sun, currently a postdoctoral student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.In earlier work, co-author Soo Rin Kim, then a fellow of the Energy Biosciences Institute, engineered a strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to consume xylose rapidly and efficiently. Kim is currently a faculty member at Kyungpook National University, South Korea. In the current study, they used switchgrass harvested at the U. of I. Energy Farm to create hemicellulose hydrolysates. The engineered yeast cells were used to ferment the glucose, xylose and acetate in the hydrosalates.When glucose and acetate were provided together, S. cerevisiae rapidly converted the glucose into ethanol, decreasing the pH level of the cell culture. However, acetate consumption was strongly inhibited, causing the culture to become toxic to the yeast cells under low pH conditions.When xylose was provided with acetate,  these two carbon sources formed synergies that promoted efficient metabolism of both compounds,  Sun said.  Xylose supported cell growth and supplied sufficient energy for acetate assimilation. Therefore, the yeast could metabolize acetate as a substrate very efficiently to produce a lot of TAL. At the same time, the pH level of the media increased as the acetate was metabolized, which in turn promoted the yeast s consumption of the xylose, Sun said.When they analyzed S. cerevisiae s gene expression by RNA sequencing, they found that key genes involved in acetate uptake and metabolism were dramatically upregulated by xylose compared with glucose, Sun said.Yeast cells that were fed both acetate and xylose accumulated greater biomass, along with 48% and 45% increases in their levels of lipids and ergosterol, respectively. Ergosterol is a fungal hormone that plays an important role in stress adaptation during fermentation.Co-utilization of acetate and xylose also increased the yeast s supply of acetyl-CoA, a precursor molecule of ergosterol and lipids, and provided a metabolic shortcut   converting the acetate to acetyl-CoA, bringing TAL production a step closer, Sun said. By co-utilizing xylose and acetate as carbon sources, we were able to improve TAL production dramatically   14 times greater production than previously reported using engineered S. cerevisiae,  Sun said.  We employed this strategy for the production of vitamin A as well, demonstrating its potential for overproducing other high-value bioproducts derived from acetyl-CoA, such as steroids and flavonoids. Because the process thoroughly used the carbon sources in the lignocellulosic biomass, Jin and Sun said it can be seamlessly integrated into cellulosic biorefineries. It s about the sustainability of our society,  Sun said.  We need to fully utilize these untapped resources to build a sustainable future. We hope that in 50 or 100 years, we will depend mainly on these renewable and abundant feedstocks to produce the energy and the materials we need for our daily life. That s our goal. But for now, we are just doing small things to make sure this is gradually happening. Reference: Sun L, Lee JW, Yook S, et al.

A new study by Salk scientists further shows that TRE confers multiple health benefits besides weight loss. The study also shows that these benefits may depend on sex and age.Most TRE studies focus on weight loss in young male mice, but Salk scientists wanted to determine whether TRE confers additional benefits on other populations. Their findings, published in Cell Reports on August 17, 2021, show that while age and sex do affect the outcomes of TRE, the eating strategy delivers multiple health benefits for young and old of both sexes, and indicates that TRE may be a valuable intervention for type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and liver cancer, and even infectious diseases such as COVID-19, in humans.  For many TRE clinical interventions, the primary outcome is weight loss, but we ve found that TRE is good not only for metabolic disease but also for increased resilience against infectious diseases and insulin resistance,  says Satchidananda Panda, a professor in Salk s Regulatory Biology Laboratory and holder of the Rita and Richard Atkinson Chair. Glucose intolerance is the first step on a slippery slope to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver cancer one of the few cancers whose incidence and death rates have increased, rather than declined, in the past 25 to 30 years. Further, over 40 percent of Americans are already diabetic or prediabetic, with the American Diabetes Association predicting 1.5 million new cases each year. These trends make finding a simple treatment for glucose intolerance a major priority. Breaking the conventional young-male-mice mold, the researchers fed a high-fat, high-sugar diet to male and female mice of two age groups (equivalent to 20- and 42-year-old humans), restricting eating to nine hours per day. The team ran tests to ascertain how age and sex affect the outcomes of TRE on a variety of health parameters: fatty liver disease; glucose regulation; muscle mass, performance and endurance; and survival of sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection. They also took the rare step of matching their lab conditions to the animals  circadian clocks (mice sleep during the day and rise at night), often working via night-vision goggles and specialized lighting. Analyzing the tissues of mice on TRE to ascertain their chemical makeup and processes, the researchers found that regardless of age, sex or weight loss profile, TRE strongly protected against fatty liver disease, a condition that affects up to 100 million Americans and for which no medicine has been approved.  This was our first time studying female mice, and we weren t sure what to expect,  says first author Amandine Chaix, a former staff scientist in the Panda lab and now an assistant professor at the University of Utah.  We were surprised to find that, although the females on TRE were not protected from weight gain, they still showed metabolic benefits, including less-fatty livers and better-controlled blood sugar.  Oral glucose tolerance tests given to mice after 16 hours of fasting indicated that TRE was associated with a lower increase in blood glucose and a faster return to normal blood sugar levels in both young and middle-aged males, with a significant improvement in glucose tolerance in young and middle-aged females. Similarly, middle-aged females and males on TRE were able to restore normal blood sugar levels more efficiently than control mice, who had food available at all times. This finding indicates that TRE may be a low- or no-cost, user-friendly way to prevent or treat diabetes, and supports the results of the lab s 2019 study on TRE for metabolic syndrome in humans. The researchers also found that TRE may protect both males and females from sepsis-induced death a particular danger in ICUs, especially during the pandemic. After administering a toxin that induced a sepsis-like condition in the mice, the researchers monitored survival rates for 13 days and found that TRE protected both male and female mice from dying of sepsis. TRE didn t just protect against fatty liver disease, diabetes, and death from sepsis; it even enabled male mice to preserve and add muscle mass and improve muscle performance (the effect did not hold for females). This finding is particularly significant for the elderly, for whom improved muscle performance can help guard against falls. This surprising discovery points to next steps and new questions for Panda s lab: Does muscle mass increase because TRE helps muscles repair and regenerate better? What is the impact of TRE on muscle metabolism and regeneration?  These are very exciting questions for us, and we look forward to studying them in more detail,  says Panda.ReferenceChaix A et al.

Despite this clinical burden, cardiovascular drug advancements have slowed over the past 20 years. The decrease in cardiovascular therapeutic development is attributed to the lack of efficiency in converting possible treatments into approved methods, specifically due to the discrepancy between studies that take place outside the body compared to inside.The team's research at Texas A&M University aims to remodel current methodologies to minimize this gap and improve the translatability of these techniques by directing 3D bioprinting toward vascular medicine. Gaharwar is a biomaterials expert and has developed novel bioinks that offer unprecedented biocompatibility and control of mechanical properties needed to print blood vessels, whereas Jain's expertise lies in creating biomimetic in vitro models of vascular and hematological diseases. This interdisciplinary and collaborative project was recently published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.Bioprinting in 3D is an advanced manufacturing technique capable of producing unique, tissue-shaped constructs in a layer-by-layer fashion with embedded cells, making the arrangement more likely to mirror the native, multicellular makeup of vascular structures. A range of hydrogel bioinks was introduced to design these structures; however, there is a limitation in available bioinks that can mimic the vascular composition of native tissues. Current bioinks lack high printability and are unable to deposit a high density of living cells into complex 3D architectures, making them less effective.To overcome these shortcomings, Gaharwar and Jain developed a new nanoengineered bioink to print 3D, anatomically accurate, multicellular blood vessels. Their approach offers improved real-time resolution for both macro-structure and tissue-level micro-structure, something that currently is not possible with available bioinks.""A remarkably unique characteristic of this nanoengineered bioink is that regardless of cell density, it demonstrates a high printability and ability to protect encapsulated cells against high shear forces in the bioprinting process,"" Gaharwar said. ""Remarkably, 3D-bioprinted cells maintain a healthy phenotype and remain viable for nearly one month postfabrication.""Leveraging these unique properties, the nanoengineered bioink is printed into 3D cylindrical blood vessels, consisting of living co-cultures of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, which provides researchers the opportunity to model vascular function and disease impact.This 3D-bioprinted vessel provides a potential tool to understand vascular disease pathophysiology and assess therapeutics, toxins or other chemicals in preclinical trials.Other project collaborators include Dr. John Cooke from the Houston Methodist Research Institute and Dr. Javier Jo from the University of Oklahoma.

The pathway plays a wide variety of roles in animal and human development, and the ability to regulate it with light will allow researchers to better study its assorted functions, the team says.Led by Kai Zhang, a professor of biochemistry, and Jing Yang, a professor of comparative biosciences, the research team published its work in the Journal of Molecular Biology, where it was chosen as a featured communication, representing the top 1% of papers.The Wnt pathway is activated by a receptor on the cell surface that triggers a cascade response within the cell. Too much or too little signal can be disastrous, Zhang said, making it very difficult to study the pathway using standard techniques for stimulating cell-surface receptors.""During embryonic development, Wnt regulates the development of many organs such as the head, spinal cord and eyes. It also maintains stem cells in many tissues in adults: While insufficient Wnt signaling leads to the failure of tissue repair, elevated Wnt signaling may result in cancer,"" Yang said.It is very difficult to achieve the necessary balance with standard approaches to regulating such pathways, such as chemical stimulation, Zhang said. To address this, the researchers engineered the receptor protein to respond to blue light. With this approach, they can fine-tune the Wnt level by modulating the intensity and duration of the light.""Light as a treatment strategy has been used in photodynamic therapy, with the advantages of biocompatibility and no residual effect in the exposed area. However, most photodynamic therapy typically uses light to generate high-energy chemicals -- for example, reactive oxygen species -- without differentiating between normal and diseased tissues, making it impossible to target treatment,"" Zhang said. ""In our work, we have demonstrated that blue light can activate a signaling pathway within different body compartments of frog embryos. We envision that a spatially defined stimulation of cell functions could mitigate the challenges of off-target toxicity.""The researchers demonstrated their technique and verified its tunableness and sensitivity by prompting spinal cord and head development in frog embryos. They hypothesize their technique also could be applied to other membrane-bound receptors that have proved difficult to target, as well as other animals who share the Wnt pathway, allowing a greater understanding of how these pathways regulate development -- and what happens when they are over- or under-stimulated.""As we continue expanding our light-sensitive systems to cover other essential signaling pathways underlying embryonic development, we will provide the developmental biology community with a valuable set of tools that can help them determine the signaling outcomes underlying many developmental processes,"" Yang said.The researchers also hope their light-based technique for studying Wnt can illuminate tissue repair and cancer research in human tissues.""Because cancers often involve overactivated signaling, we envision that a light-sensitive Wnt activator could be used to study cancer progression in live cells,"" Zhang said. ""In combination with live-cell imaging, we would be able to quantitatively determine the signaling threshold that could transform a normal cell into a cancerous one, therefore providing primary data for target-specific therapeutic development in future precision medicine.""Reference: Krishnamurthy VV, Hwang H, Fu J, Yang J, Zhang K.

Franklin Styer Professor of Horticultural Botany and professor of plant molecular biology in Penn State s College of Agricultural Sciences. The genomes of different populations of cacao trees are 99.9% identical, but it s the structural variants in that one-tenth of 1% of their genomes that accounts for the plant s diversity in different regions and its adaptation to climate and various diseases,  he said.  This study makes an association between structural variation and the ability of a plant to adapt to a local environment. Molecular geneticists have known for about a decade that genomic structural variants can play important roles in the adaptation and speciation of both plants and animals, but their overall influence on the fitness of plant populations is poorly understood. That s partly because accurate population-level identification of structural variants requires analysis of multiple high-quality genome assemblies, which are not widely available.In this study, the researchers investigated the fitness consequences of genomic structural variants in natural populations by analyzing and comparing chromosome-scale genome assemblies of 31 naturally occurring populations of Theobroma cacao, the long-lived tree species that is the source of chocolate. Among those 31 strains of cacao, they found more than 160,000 structural variants.In findings published today (Aug. 16) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers reported that most structural variants are deleterious and thus constrain adaptation of the cacao plant. These detrimental effects likely arise as a direct result of impaired gene function and as an indirect result of suppressed gene recombination over long periods of time, they noted.However, despite the overall detrimental effects, the study also identified individual structural variants bearing signatures of local adaptation, several of which are associated with genes differentially expressed between populations. Genes involved in pathogen resistance are among these candidates, highlighting the contribution of structural variants to this important local adaptation trait.Overall, their findings provide important insight into processes underlying the fitness effects of structural variants in natural populations, the researchers pointed out. They suggest that structural variants influence gene expression, which likely impairs gene function and contributes to their detrimental effects. They also provided empirical support for a theoretical prediction that structural variants result in the suppression of gene recombination, making it less likely the plants can adapt to stressors.Beyond revealing new empirical evidence for the evolutionary importance of structural variants in all plants, documenting the genomic differences and structural variants among the 31 strains of cacao provides a valuable resource for ongoing genetic and breeding studies for that valuable plant, Guiltinan noted. All cacao comes from the Amazon basin   plants were collected a long time ago from the wild by collectors and they were cloned, so we have a permanent collection,  he said.  Their genomes have been sequenced, and that represents a huge amount of work and data. As a result of this study, we know that structural variation is important to the survival of the plant, to the evolution of the plant and especially to the adaptation of the plant to local conditions.

Turns out, no one yet knows how testosterone really does all that.   With a $1.9 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Beau Alward, assistant professor of psychology with a joint appointment in biology at the University of Houston, is set to find out.   We know androgens like testosterone control social behavior, but in reality, we still do not know precisely what aspects of social behavior androgens regulate and how this is done. We know they affect neurons, but not how they do it,  said Alward.   Alward will use the highly social African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni (A. burtoni) along with cutting-edge techniques such as single-cell genomics, whole-brain imaging, and rich social behavior paradigms to address these questions.  It has been a challenge to disentangle the role of steroid hormones on brain function because they broadly influence physiology and behavior, making it difficult to characterize direct versus indirect effects.  Alward used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to genetically delete distinct androgen receptors (ARs) in A. burtoni. These mutant A. burtoni lack functional genes for AR , AR , or both. Findings in these mutants reveal AR  and AR  are required for distinct physiological and behavioral aspects of social status, making them ideal for the proposed projects.   For example, AR  mutant males do not perform dominant social behaviors but have large testes and bright coloration, while AR  mutant males perform dominant social behaviors but possess small testes and drab coloration,  said Alward.  Males mutant for both receptors lack all of these traits and actually perform female-typical behaviors.  Using the AR-mutant burtoni combined with pharmacology, Alward will use naturalistic social behavior paradigms that tax the genes and neurons that control social behavior. The specific genes and neurons involved will be identified using single-cell genomics and whole-brain imaging, respectively. The combination can elucidate the molecular and neural basis of social behavior and uncover the connections between steroid hormones, gene expression in the brain, and neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to modify, change, and adapt.  As no other laboratory in existence possesses these AR mutants, my research program is highly innovative and in a unique position for addressing these questions,  said Alward. ""We will be able to address fundamental questions regarding the hormonal control of the brain and social behavior.  These questions may connect naturally to those on the hormonal control of social behavior in other species, such as humans, and how social systems emerge throughout evolution.

Questioning the belief that dates back to philosopher John Locke that people born blind could never truly understand color, the team of cognitive neuroscientists demonstrated that congenitally blind and sighted individuals actually understand it quite similarly. A common intuition dating back to Locke is that a blind person could learn the arbitrary fact that marigolds are  yellow  and tomatoes are  red  but would still miss out on in-depth understanding of color,  said senior author Marina Bedny.  The idea is that to really know something you have to see it for yourself, and without vision, you pick up shallow facts by talking to people. This study with blind people suggests the opposite. Talking to people conveys in-depth understanding of color better than arbitrary color facts. The findings are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.In a two-phase experiment, blind and sighted adults were first asked the common color of objects (the arbitrary facts), why they were that color, and the likelihood that two of those objects selected at random would be the same color. The objects were a combination of natural things (fruits, plants, gems) and man-made ones (pen, dollar bill, stop sign).Even though blind participants didn t always agree with sighted people about arbitrary color facts, say, that bananas were yellow, blind people s reasoning about why bananas are yellow and judgments about how likely two bananas are to be the same color (color consistency[MB1] ) were identical to sighted people, the team found. The result held across different types of objects, including those that are colored for specific reasons, like stop signs, coins and even wedding dresses.Blind and sighted individuals also displayed the same depth of understanding in explaining why objects had certain colors, said lead author Judy Kim, a former Johns Hopkins graduate student who is now a postdoctoral associate at Yale University.The color of polar bears was one revealing example from the experiment. All sighted participants said they re white to blend in with the snow but quite a few blind participants said they re black to absorb heat and stay warm.  Blind individuals give a coherent explanation of a polar bear s color even when they don t agree with sighted people on the particular color of a polar bear,  Kim said.Next the team asked participants to make predictions about the colors of imaginary objects they d never seen or heard of in a  explorer on an island  scenario.  We wanted to see how people reason about things they have never experienced,  Kim said.  It s a great way to test the depth of people s color understanding. The team told participants about items found on a remote island where the people have their own language, tools, machines, customs, etc., and the island ecology is unique. Participants heard about objects like  a green gem that is spiky the size of a hand  and  a gadget that is triangular, yellow, and the size of a thumb,  and then asked how likely another one of those would also be the same color.Blind and sighted people made identical judgements about these novel objects, showing that their color knowledge generalizes to new examples and is not dependent on memorizing.In a related recent study, the team similarly found that while blind people have not seen animals like elephants and lions, they make informed guesses about their appearance based on an understanding why animals look the way they do (e.g., mammals that live on land have legs).Bedny would next like to determine how color knowledge is managed in the brain, and to work with blind children to try to learn how and when blind and sighted people acquire understanding of color. We hypothesize it s by casual learning through conversation and reading but when exactly does that happen?  she said.  Do blind and sighted children learn this information in the same way? Are there developmental differences where sighted children acquire the information at an earlier age, before they re using language and blind children acquire it only after they learned to talk and then catch up?

Beyond traditional mannequin-like appendages, there is a growing number of commercial neuroprosthetics   highly articulated bionic limbs, engineered to sense a user s residual muscle signals and robotically mimic their intended motions.But this high-tech dexterity comes at a price. Neuroprosthetics can cost tens of thousands of dollars and are built around metal skeletons, with electrical motors that can be heavy and rigid.Now engineers at MIT and Shanghai Jiao Tong University have designed a soft, lightweight, and potentially low-cost neuroprosthetic hand. Amputees who tested the artificial limb performed daily activities, such as zipping a suitcase, pouring a carton of juice, and petting a cat, just as well as   and in some cases better than  those with more rigid neuroprosthetics.The researchers found the prosthetic, designed with a system for tactile feedback, restored some primitive sensation in a volunteer s residual limb. The new design is also surprisingly durable, quickly recovering after being struck with a hammer or run over with a car.The smart hand is soft and elastic, and weighs about half a pound. Its components total around $500   a fraction of the weight and material cost associated with more rigid smart limbs.

In target-site resistance, a tiny mutation in the plant s genetic code means the chemical no longer fits in the protein it s designed to attack. In non-target-site resistance, the plant deploys a whole slew of enzymes that detoxify the chemical before it can cause harm.Target-site resistance is easy for scientists. They know what the target protein is, which means they can look directly at the genetic code to figure out the mutation responsible. But for non-target-site resistance, it s a guessing game. Researchers can sometimes tell what class of enzymes detoxifies the chemical, but they know next to nothing about what genes code for those enzymes. In other words, non-target-site resistance is a black box.A University of Illinois study is the first to open that box in a new way, identifying gene regions responsible for non-target-site herbicide resistance in waterhemp. We used a genetic mapping approach with the reference genome for waterhemp, a species that can cause yield losses upwards of 70% in corn and is resistant to seven herbicide modes of action,  says Pat Tranel, professor and associate head in the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois and co-author on the study.  We were able to narrow it down to two regions of the genome, or about 60 genes. Being able to pinpoint the genes for non-target-site resistance could enable tools for early detection and herbicide management. We eventually want to develop an assay farmers can use to tell if the waterhemp in their field is resistant to a given chemical, either to confirm why a previous application did not work or before they spray to see if they're going to waste money,  says Brent Murphy, doctoral researcher and lead author on the study.  These genomic assays exist for target-site resistance because we know the region of the genome where those mutations are, but for non-target-site resistance, we have had no idea where to look until now. Now we know the genes responsible are somewhere in these two small regions of the genome. So we ve come to an intermediary step to eventually developing an assay that growers can use to determine whether or not they should be spraying a certain chemistry. The researchers specifically looked for genes that allow waterhemp to evade HPPD-inhibiting herbicides such as tembotrione, a chemical commonly applied in seed corn and other production systems. To find the genomic regions responsible, they mated waterhemp plants that showed resistance or sensitivity to HPPD inhibitors. Then they exposed the grandchildren of those parent plants to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides to see how they fared. Because the complete waterhemp genome is now available, they were able to look for commonalities among plants that survived the HPPD-inhibitor application. You basically ask the question, for the resistant plants, what part of their genome do they share in common? And that gets you to what part of the genome is controlling the trait of interest. Using this approach, known as genetic mapping, we identified two regions of the genome that seemed to be associated with resistance,  Tranel says.Murphy was able to determine which plants had each of the two regions, and which had both. This allowed him to rank the importance of the gene regions. A lot of times, we know a trait is controlled by two genes. But does that mean both genes are equally important, or one gene is 90% responsible, and the other gene is 10%? That's part of what we re looking at in the genetic architecture of a trait: the number of genes, where they are, and the relative importance of these different genes,  Tranel says.  Here, we saw a nice stepwise effect. If you had one of the regions, you were kind of resistant. If you had the other one, you were kind of resistant. If you have them both? You're pretty resistant. Essentially like the resistant parent. While the researchers still don t know which of the 60-ish genes are essential to HPPD-inhibitor resistance   they have follow-up studies in mind to narrow the search even farther   they know none of the genes encode p450 enzymes. These have been implicated in multiple studies as key players in non-target-site resistance. While a p450 enzyme might still be involved, our mapping study indicates the change causing resistance is in a gene regulating the p450, rather than in the p450 gene itself,  Tranel explains. HPPD-inhibitors are commonly used in seed corn and other maize production systems, but, interestingly, they hadn t been used in the field where the researchers collected the waterhemp for the study. There wasn't a previous field-use history of this chemistry. So, it was really interesting to see that our population was resistant to it. How did this develop? Most of the time you expect resistance to develop as a result of some form of selection pressure. But here, we don't have an obvious one,  Murphy says.Tranel thinks non-target-site resistance to one class of herbicides might confer cross-resistance to other classes. The population in the study was resistant to 2,4-D, a herbicide from another class that might have triggered resistance to HPPD-inhibitors. Why do we have this plant that s resistant to multiple herbicides? Are there some genomic changes in common to facilitate that resistance? It's really important to understand this, as we try to give farmers advice about what can they do to mitigate non-target-site resistance, because it's still a bit of a black box,  Tranel says.  With target site resistance, we can tell them to use herbicides with different modes of action. But in non-target-site resistance, different herbicides could be metabolized by, for example, different p450s that are regulated in the same way. That's why we need to unravel this further to come up with better, more informed strategies to mitigate non-target-site resistance. Tranel expects that, as more weed genomes become available, genetic mapping will become a mainstay for investigating non-target-site resistance. Finally, we are getting the tools we need to really get to the bottom of metabolic herbicide resistance, which is the greatest threat to contemporary weed management,  he says.Reference: Murphy BP, Beffa R, Tranel PJ.

We think of cognitive resilience as a buffer to the effects of brain aging and disease,  says lead researcher Joel Salinas, MD, the Lulu P. and David J. Levidow Assistant Professor of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and member of the Department of Neurology s Center for Cognitive Neurology.  This study adds to growing evidence that people can take steps, either for themselves or the people they care about most, to increase the odds they ll slow down cognitive aging or prevent the development of symptoms of Alzheimer s disease something that is all the more important given that we still don t have a cure for the disease. An estimated 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer s disease, a progressive condition that affects mostly those over 65 and interferes with memory, language, decision-making, and the ability to live independently. Dr. Salinas says that while the disease usually affects an older population, the results of this study indicate that people younger than 65 would benefit from taking stock of their social support. For every unit of decline in brain volume, individuals in their 40s and 50s with low listener availability had a cognitive age that was 4 years older than those with high listener availability. These four years can be incredibly precious. Too often we think about how to protect our brain health when we re much older, after we ve already lost a lot of time decades before to build and sustain brain-healthy habits,  says Dr. Salinas.  But today, right now, you can ask yourself if you truly have someone available to listen to you in a supportive way, and ask your loved ones the same. Taking that simple action sets the process in motion for you to ultimately have better odds of long-term brain health and the best quality of life you can have. Dr. Salinas also recommends that physicians consider adding this question to the standard social history portion of a patient interview: asking patients whether they have access to someone they can count on to listen to them when they need to talk. Loneliness is one of the many symptoms of depression, and has other health implications for patients,  says Dr. Salinas.  These kinds of questions about a person s social relationships and feelings of loneliness can tell you a lot about a patient s broader social circumstances, their future health, and how they re really doing outside of the clinic.

Unfortunately, producing deuterium and using it to protect silicon-based semiconductors requires a lot of energy and very expensive deuterium gas. Now, scientists from Japan have discovered an energy-efficient exchange reaction to swap hydrogen atoms for deuterium on the surface of nanocrystalline silicon. Their results pave the way to more durable electronic devices while keeping costs and the environmental impact low. The discovery of isotopes in the early 20th century marked a key moment in the history of physics and led to a much more refined understanding of the atomic nucleus. Isotopes are  versions  of a given element of the periodic table that bear the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons, and therefore vary in mass. These differences in mass can radically alter certain physical properties of the atoms, such as their radioactive decay rates, their possible reaction pathways in nuclear fission reactors, and much more. While most isotopes of an element share similar chemical properties, there is one notable exception: hydrogen isotopes. Most hydrogen atoms on Earth contain only one proton and one electron, but there exist hydrogen isotopes which also have one neutron (deuterium) or two neutrons (tritium). Deuterium, which essentially weighs twice as much as  normal  hydrogen, has found many practical and scientific uses. For example, it can be used to label and track molecules such as proteins to investigate biochemical processes. It can also be strategically used in drugs to reduce their metabolic rate and increase their half-life in the body. Another important application of deuterium exists in the field of semiconductor electronics. The surface of silicon-based semiconductors has to be  passivated  with hydrogen to ensure silicon atoms don t come off (desorb) easily, thereby increasing the durability of microchips, batteries, and solar cells. However, through mechanisms that are still not completely understood, passivation with deuterium instead of hydrogen results in desorption probabilities about one hundred times lower, implying that deuterium may soon become an indispensable ingredient in electronic devices. Unfortunately, both the procurement of deuterium and available techniques to enrich silicon surfaces with it are very energy inefficient or require very expensive deuterium gas. Fortunately, at Nagoya City University (NCU), Japan, a team of scientists led by Professor Takahiro Matsumoto have found an energy-efficient strategy to enrich silicon surfaces using a dilute deuterium solution. This study, which was published in Physical Review Materials, was carried out in collaboration with Dr. Takashi Ohhara of Japan Atomic Energy Agency and Dr. Yoshihiko Kanemitsu from Kyoto University. The researchers found that a peculiar exchange reaction from hydrogen to deuterium can occur on the surface of nanocrystalline silicon (n-Si). They demonstrated this reaction in thin n-Si films submerged in a deuterium-containing solution using inelastic neutron scattering. This spectroscopy technique involves irradiating neutrons onto a sample and analyzing the resulting atomic motions or crystal vibrations. These experiments, coupled with other spectroscopy methods and energy calculations based on quantum mechanics, revealed the underlying mechanisms that favor the replacement of hydrogen terminations on the surface of n-Si with deuterium: The exchange process is closely related to differences in the surface vibrational modes between hydrogen- and deuterium-terminated n-Si.  We achieved a fourfold increase in the concentration of surface deuterium atoms on n-Si in our experiments performed in the liquid phase,  highlights Dr. Matsumoto,  We also proposed a gas-phase enrichment protocol for n-Si that, according to our theoretical calculations, could enhance the rate of deuterium enrichment 15-fold.  This innovative strategy of exploiting quantum effects on the surface of n-Si could pave the way to new methods to procure and utilize deuterium.  The efficient hydrogen-to-deuterium exchange reaction we reported may lead to sustainable, economically feasible, and environment-friendly deuterium enrichment protocols, leading to more durable semiconductor technology,  concludes Dr. Matsumoto. The NCU team also stated that  It has been theoretically predicted that the heavier the hydrogen is, the higher the efficiency of the exchange reaction is. Thus, we can expect more efficient enrichment of tritium atoms on n-Si, which leads to the possibility of purifying tritium contaminated water. We believe that this is an issue that must be urgently solved.  Let us hope the findings of this work allow us to benefit more from the heavier isotopes of hydrogen without taking a toll on our planet.ReferenceMatsumoto T, Nomata I, Ohhara T, Kanemitsu Y.

The study, published in Nature Microbiology, resolves a long-standing question on how the parasite responds to changes in its environment.Infection by Plasmodium falciparum, which causes one of the most severe forms of malaria in humans, is characterised by periodic fevers (each time a cycle of asexual reproduction is completed and parasites are released into the blood stream). This is because fever is an important element in our body s response against pathogens, since it affects the stability of cellular proteins and helps reduce parasite burden. In turn, most organisms have a defence mechanism against increased temperatures: the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSP), which act as chaperones.  In most of the eukaryotic organisms, from yeasts to mammals, the expression of these proteins depends on a highly conserved transcription factor called HSF1,  explains Alfred Cort s, ICREA researcher at ISGlobal and study coordinator.  However, malaria parasites   which are also eukaryotes - lack the HSF1 gene, although we know that they can survive at febrile temperatures,  he adds. In this study, Cort s and his team set out to investigate how the malaria parasite regulates its response to higher temperatures (or heat shock) despite the absence of HSF1. They observed that a P. falciparum cell line, grown in the laboratory, had lost its capacity to survive when exposed to a temperature of 41.5 C, and that this was due to a mutation in a gene which they named PfAP2-HS. They showed that PfAP2-HS acts as a transcription factor that activates the expression of heat shock proteins hsp70-1 and hsp90 by binding to their respective promoters (i.e. the  on-off button  of a gene). They also showed that engineered parasites lacking the PfAP2-HS gene not only had a lower survival when exposed to higher temperatures, but also showed reduced growth at  normal  temperatures of 37 C.  This means that, in addition to its role in the protective heat-shock response, PfAP2-HS is also important for maintaining protein stability in the parasite at basal temperatures,  says Elisabet Tint -Font, first author of the study. Moreover, absence of PfAP2-HS in P. falciparum led to a higher susceptibility of the parasite to the antimalarial drug artemisinin, due to alterations in protein balance. The research team found homologues of PfAP2-HS in all Plasmodium species analysed, even in those that infect mice and do not cause fever.  This suggests that, at least in those species, the response orchestrated by AP2-HS could protect against other adverse conditions in the host,  says Cort s.  This is the first transcription factor described in Plasmodium capable of regulating responses to adverse host conditions, including fever. PfAP2-HS acts as  an orchestra director , coordinating the other proteins involved in the response,  he adds. ReferenceTint -Font E, Michel-Tod  L, Russell TJ et al.

Although recent studies of vaccines tend to focus on the antibody response, the T-cell response is also an important and potentially more durable source of protection yet little has been reported so far on the T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.In the new study, which appears in the journal Immunity, the Penn Medicine researchers analyzed the T-cell responses in 47 healthy people who received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines.The results reveal the complex details of how the T-cell response to these vaccines unfolds, and underline the importance of a second dose for people with no history of COVID-19. The findings showed, however, that in people with a history of COVID-19, the T-cell response was already robust after the first vaccine dose, with no significant increase after the second dose, which may have implications for potential future booster shots. Our findings underscore the fact that we need to look at T cells, not just antibodies, if we want a complete picture of the vaccine response for those who have not had COIVD-19 and for those who have recovered from the disease,  said senior author E. John Wherry, PhD, chair of the department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics and director of the Penn Institute of Immunology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  Antibodies are forked proteins secreted by immune cells called B cells; they can bind tightly to specific viral structures on virus-infected cells. T cells also have antibody-like receptors that enable tight binding to specific viral structures, but they are whole cells, some of which called  killer  T-cells are capable of directly killing virus-infected cells they encounter. T cells therefore have long been regarded as the heavy armor of the immune system. Their responses to vaccines are harder to study than antibody responses, though, so less is known about those responses, including in the case of COVID-19.Researchers examined in detail the T-cell responses to mRNA vaccination in 36 healthy people who had no history of COVID-19, and 11 people who had previously recovered from COVID-19.In the group of participants who did not previously have COVID-19, they found that the first vaccine dose elicited a rapid and strong response from helper T cells called CD4 T cells some of which help marshal an antibody response, while others stimulate the proliferation of CD8 killer T cells. The strengths of those initial CD4 T cell responses generally predicted the later strengths of antibody and killer T-cell responses. However, the killer T cells tended not to appear in large numbers until after the second vaccine dose confirming the importance of that second dose for people with no COVID-19 history.By contrast, in the prior-COVID-19 group, helper and killer T cells specific for the COVID-19 coronavirus were already substantially present before the first dose. After that first dose, T cell numbers rose somewhat, but did not significantly increase after the second dose. For people who haven t had COVID-19, the first dose powerfully primes the pump, and the second dose turns on the whole engine but having had COVID-19 is like having had that first vaccine dose already,  Wherry said.  It is important to point out, however, that a complete understanding of the relative importance of these T cell responses, compared to antibody, in protection from future infections will require larger clinical studies. The results also showed that the T-cell response in the weeks after mRNA vaccination includes T-cell types normally elicited by natural infection and in general, natural viral infection is known to be capable of inducing T-cell protection that lasts years and even decades. We need to do follow-up studies to confirm the longevity of the T-cell response to vaccination, but our results here support the idea that that response can be long-lasting,  Wherry said.Reference: Painter MM, Mathew D, Goel RR, et al.

The study is reported in an article published in the journal PNAS. It suggests that the nine genes that encode toxins produced by the jararaca pit viper Bothrops jararaca probably originated in genes that had different functions in the ancestral species. In sequencing the snake s genome, we identified markers that enabled us to compare toxin genes with genes in the same position in the genomes of other animals, such as snakes without venom, lizards and amphibians. We found nine of the 12 toxin genes in the jararaca to be highly similar to those occupying the same position in the DNA of these other species. We concluded that most of the toxin genes probably arose from elements that already existed in the same part of the genome of the ancestor common to all these animals,  said In cio Junqueira de Azevedo, a researcher at Butantan Institute and last author of the article.Azevedo is a principal investigator at the Center for Research on Toxins, Immune Response and Cell Signaling (CeTICS), one of the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Centers (RIDCs) funded by FAPESP. These genes had physiological functions in the common ancestor of all these species. At some point they probably began playing a role similar to toxin genes or were selected for this route and lost their original functions. Our study located elements that will help scientists understand the evolution of toxins and the mechanisms that led to the recruitment of certain genes to perform this new function in the production of venom,  said Diego Dantas Almeida, first author of the article. The study was conducted during his PhD research, which was supported by FAPESP.The sequencing also showed that two genes that encode important toxins probably originated in duplication. In any organism, a gene normally evolves more freely and ends up performing different functions when a copy performs its original functions.In the jararaca, the copies must have come under selective pressure to produce two families of toxins that account for most of the venom s action: snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and phospholipases A2 (PLA2). Most of the genes that encode toxins in this snake were already thought to have originated in this manner. It was impossible to determine the origin of only one of the 12 gene families that encode its toxins. We were able to show that non-toxic  ancestral  genes exist in these two families. They re still present in the DNA, right alongside the toxin genes. The ancestral genes have completely disappeared from the other families. They ve probably been transformed into toxin genes,  said Vincent Louis Viala, a co-author of the article and former recipient of a postdoctoral fellowship from FAPESP.","Published: August 17, 2021"

However, it is known that the bacteria of the intestinal flora and dysfunction in the immune system play an important role. In patients with IBD, an increased number of cells in the intestinal wall, known as epithelial cells, die. Bacteria then pass from the interior of the intestine into the damaged intestinal wall, causing inflammation and further cell death. The epithelial barrier, the barrier between the intestinal contents and the intestinal wall also becomes more permeable. With increasing cell death, the disease also progresses as more bacteria settle in the damaged intestinal wall   a vicious circle. A research team led by Prof. Dr. Christoph Becker from FAU has now found a mechanism that could prevent cell death, break the vicious circle and potentially be used as a therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases. The results have now been published in the renowned journal Nature Cell Biology.In mice and tissues of ulcerative colitis patients, researchers found that a messenger substance called prostaglandin E2 can protect epithelial cells from a special form of cell death, necroptosis. Prostaglandins are hormone-like messenger substances that have various effects in the organism. Researchers have found that prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 are released in the body during inflammation. However, it is not yet fully understood how prostaglandins regulate inflammatory processes.In recent years, the researchers have already shown that the incorrect regulation of necroptosis leads to cell death and thus to holes in the intestinal barrier. Prostaglandin E2 prevents this by binding to EP4 receptors on the epithelial cells. The more of these receptors are activated, the fewer cells die, according to the FAU team from the Department of Medicine 1   Gastroenterology, Pneumology and Endocrinology   at Universit tsklinikum Erlangen. Patients with high levels of EP4 on the cell surface show a milder course of disease than patients with low levels of EP4.The activation of the receptors by prostaglandin E2 thus counteracts the progression of intestinal inflammation. Together with colleagues in Canada, the research team tested an artificially produced molecule that can activate the EP4 receptor, like prostaglandin E2. Treatment with this molecule could prevent excessive cell death in the intestinal barrier and block bacteria from penetrating it. These findings offer a promising new therapy approach for ulcerative colitis and other chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.Reference: Patankar JV, M ller TM, Kantham S, et al.

Now a collaboration of chemists including Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor John E. Moses, Nobel laureate K. Barry Sharpless and Associate Professor Peng Wu, both of Scripps Research, and Han Zuilhof of Wageningen University found a way to use the molecule safely as building blocks for new products. In a paper in Nature Chemistry, they describe a new set of modifiable polymers made from SOF4.It was a team effort to tame the molecule. Zuilhof says,  The goals of the various research groups were different, but we combined all our expertise to achieve our many goals.  Suhua Li, the lead author of the study and a former postdoc in Sharpless  lab, started with a tiny container of the gas in the lab, but after he used that up, he says,  there was no more SOF4 available anywhere in the world. The great potential of the SOF4 chemistry inspired me to make the gas by myself, even though the procedure seemed dangerous. The SOF4 molecule could be used as a hub to link together diverse components into a modular family of new and potentially valuable materials. Even more importantly, the scientists found that the reactions could be done in an environmentally safe way without dangerous solvents and polluting byproducts a form of what chemists call  click chemistry .Click chemistry allows users to  click  together two molecules with precision, speed, and reliability. The team used SOF4 to form long chains polymers with room for important modifications. Moses says: That s why click chemistry is great, really! These polymers could be made in one day. As long as we have the gas, we could do all that chemistry in one day, make a polymer, and post-modify it in one day. That s incredibly fast. This new chemistry will allow scientists to generate a vast new library of polymers, each with its own distinct properties and applications in drug discovery and material science. Sharpless says,  It is the making and breaking of the nascent, growing polymer links that let us access what seems magical.  Moses adds: The opportunity for these polymers, I think, is infinite.

Dinoflagellates, which are single-celled marine predators can also ingest microplastic, which in turn limits their growth and consequently their overall abundance. This has implications for the larger animals that feed on these microscopic predators, in terms of available food and the transfer of energy up the food chain.Microscopic marine predators can ingest microplastic, which in turn lowers their growth and overall abundance, finds a recent study published in Frontiers in Marine Science. This has implications for the larger marine animals that feed on these tiny predators, both in terms of available food and the transfer of energy up the food chain.  The plastic pollution of our oceans isn t just affecting whales and sea turtles, it also impacts the small, microscopic animals towards the bottom of the food chain,  said Susanne Menden-Deuer, coauthor of this research and a professor at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, US.  Our study shows that some single-celled marine predators called dinoflagellates ingest microplastic particles, and when they do, they grow 30% more slowly than those that eat just their typical algal prey. Consequently, this can almost halve the abundance of dinoflagellates, which will have an impact on the larger marine animals that feed on these tiny creatures. Dinoflagellates may be amongst the smallest predators in the ocean, but they play a huge role in grazing on phytoplankton   the single-celled algae at the base of the marine food web   and moving this food energy up the food chain to larger animals.   We know that microplastics the size of phytoplankton exist in the ocean, so we wanted to understand if dinoflagellates ingest these particles thinking they are phytoplankton, and if doing so impacted their growth and ultimately the wider marine food web,  explains Victoria Fulfer, who completed this work as part of her doctoral studies at the University of Rhode Island. The researchers separately incubated three different species of dinoflagellates with algal prey or high concentrations of microplastics in bottles of seawater to see if they ingested the plastic particles. They compared the growth of the dinoflagellates feeding on algae with those fed on plastic. Two dinoflagellate species ingested the microplastics, although one did show a preference for their natural algal prey, suggesting not all of these tiny predators are affected equally. We then observed that the growth of the dinoflagellates that ate the plastic was considerably reduced,  explained Susanne Menden-Deuer.  Interestingly, one dinoflagellate did not eat the microplastic particles. It has a different feeding mechanism to the others. Like Spider-Man, it throws a web around its prey and digests it externally, which would not work for microplastics.  Fulfer continued,  The reduced growth by the dinoflagellates that ingested microplastics means that the amount of energy transferred up the food chain is also reduced. It is clear the effects of microplastics at the base of the marine food web can have wide-spread consequences, but more research will be needed to understand how far the effects we have seen in this study will radiate through food webs and how soon we might be able to see those effects in the ocean.  Menden-Deuer said the team also hope to examine how plastic aging may affect the predator s plastic preference.  We know that bacteria grow on microplastics over time, changing the biology and chemistry on the plastic surface. Much of the signaling and communication in the plankton happens through chemicals. We expect that aged plastics would be eaten even more vigorously than the pristine ones we offered in our experiments. ReferenceFulfer VM, Menden-Deuer S.

Now, a new study from researchers in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania shows how to overcome this type of resistance and reinvigorate these T cells with an experimental small molecule inhibitor.Reporting online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the team shows how the drug, known as JQ1, improved CAR T cell function by inhibiting what is known as the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) proteins. BET, the researchers showed, can disrupt CAR expression and key acetylated histone functions in T cells in CLL.The findings demonstrate, for the first time, this mechanism of resistance and present a much-needed target for CLL when treating patients with cellular therapies like CAR. Only a small subset of patients with advanced CLL respond to CAR T cell therapy compared to 80 percent of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients with advanced disease. Why CAR T cells fail to fully attack cancer cells in so many CLL patients is an important question that needs to be answered in order to expand the use of these immunotherapies in CLL and other cancers,  said senior author Joseph A. Fraietta, PhD, an assistant professor of Microbiology at Penn, and member of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies.  Treating these  war weary  T cells during the CAR T cell engineering process has the potential to boost responses, we ve shown here. It s setting the stage for a very promising set of next steps that rationalize further studies, including clinical trials, to prove this approach is safe and feasible. Using the small molecule inhibitor and the T cells and CD19 CAR T cells from multiple previously treated patients, the researchers demonstrated that the BET protein plays a role in downregulating CAR expression, and that, if blocked, can diminish CAR cell T cell exhaustion and increase the production of CAR T cells from CLL patients with poor lymphocytes.Treatment with JQ1 also increased levels of various immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines previously reported to be produced by CAR T cells in CLL during successful therapy. The array of native immune and CAR cells mirrored those found more typically in patients who do respond.Given this observed reinvigoration of dysfunctional CLL patient CAR T cells by BET inhibition, the authors suggest that incorporating JQ1 into cellular engineering and expansion processes could lead to a generation of less defective and more potent final CAR T cells for patients.To what extent the above pathways contribute to the effects of JQ1 on CAR T cells is a focus of ongoing investigations for the research group. This work shows us that T cells can be taught new tricks,  said Bruce Levine, PhD, the Barbara and Edward Netter Professor in Cancer Gene Therapy in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine, and co-author on the study.  That is to say that the methods of manufacturing can be adapted to improve CAR T cell function, so that what would have been exhausted or dysfunctional cells can now be reinvigorated, and potentially lead to better clinical responses in more patients than before.

In preliminary studies, Molnupiravir reduced the transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G ttingen and the Julius Maximilians University W rzburg have now elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism. The antiviral agent incorporates RNA-like building blocks into the RNA genome of the virus. If this genetic material is further replicated, defective RNA copies are produced and the pathogen can no longer spread. Molnupiravir is currently being tested in clinical trials.Since the onset of the corona pandemic, numerous scientific projects set out to investigate measures against the new virus. At full stretch, researchers are developing various vaccines and drugs   with different degrees of success. Last year, the antiviral drug Remdesivir gained attention when it became the first drug against Covid-19 to be approved. Studies, including work by Patrick Cramer at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G ttingen and Claudia H bartner at the Julius Maximilians University W rzburg (Germany), showed why the drug has a rather weak effect on the virus.Molnupiravir, another antiviral drug candidate, was originally developed to treat influenza. Based on preliminary clinical trials, the compound promises to be highly effective against Sars-CoV-2.  Knowing that a new drug is working is important and good. However, it is equally important to understand how Molnupiravir works at the molecular level in order to gain insights for further antiviral development,  Max Planck Director Cramer explains.  According to our results, Molnupiravir acts in two phases.  Molnupiravir is an orally available drug that becomes activated through metabolization in the body. When it enters the cell, it is converted into RNA-like building blocks. In the first phase, the viral copying machine, called RNA polymerase, incorporates these building blocks into the RNA genome of the virus. However, unlike Remdesivir, which slows down the viral RNA polymerase, Molnupiravir does not directly interfere with the function of the copying machine. Instead, in the second phase, the RNA-like building blocks connect with the building blocks of the viral genetic material.  When the viral RNA then gets replicated to produce new viruses, it contains numerous errors, so-called mutations. As a result, the pathogen can no longer reproduce,  says Florian Kabinger, a doctoral student in Cramer's department. Together with the other first authors, Carina Stiller and Jana Schmitzov , he conducted the crucial experiments for the study.Molnupiravir also appears to trigger mutations in other RNA viruses, preventing them from spreading further.  The compound could potentially be used to treat a whole spectrum of viral diseases,  tells H bartner, a professor of chemistry at the University of W rzburg.  Molnupiravir has a lot of potential.  Currently, the promising drug candidate is in phase III studies, where it is being tested on a large number of patients. Whether Molnupiravir is safe to be approved as a drug will probably be announced in the second half of the year. The U.S. government is already optimistic and has recently secured about 1.7 million doses worth more than a billion dollars.Reference: Kabinger F, Stiller C, Schmitzov  J, et al.

The Birmingham COVID-19 test, called RTF-EXPAR, gives a sample-to-signal time of under 10 minutes, even for low viral levels where current lateral flow tests are less effective.Professors Tim Dafforn from the School of Biosciences, and Jim Tucker from the School of Chemistry, worked with graduate student Jake Carter, and Professor Andrew Beggs from the Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences on the study, which was published in PNAS. Both PCR and LAMP tests detect viral RNA, which can be present in extremely low levels in swabs taken from the mouth and nose. These tests use a two-step process which involves first converting to RNA to DNA (a process called reverse transcription) and then  amplifying  the material many times over so it can be detected in the sample. Professor Tim Dafforn said:  Both the reverse transcription and amplification steps slow down existing COVID assays that are based on nucleic acid detection, compared to antigen tests, such as lateral flow, which do not have these steps. However, while this makes lateral flow tests faster than those based on PCR and LAMP, in return they are typically less sensitive. An ideal test would be one that is both sufficiently sensitive and speedy   our test, called RTF-EXPAR, achieves this goal.RTF-EXPAR achieves this feat in two ways   firstly the assay team designed a new RNA-to-DNA conversion step that avoids reverse transcription, making it reverse transcription-free (RTF). Secondly their amplification step to generate the read-out signal uses EXPAR, an alternative DNA amplification process to PCR and LAMP.Professor Dafforn added:  EXPAR amplifies DNA at a single temperature, thus avoiding lengthy heating and cooling steps found in PCR. However, while LAMP also uses a single temperature for amplification, EXPAR is a simpler and a more direct process, in which much smaller strands are amplified. This makes EXPAR an even faster DNA amplification technique than not only PCR but also LAMP. The study revealed that the RTF-EXPAR method converts under 10 strands of RNA into billions of copies of DNA in under 10 minutes, using a one-pot assay that is compatible with more basic, benchtop equipment than that used with current testing methods.RTF-EXPAR also demonstrated significant improvements over both PCR and LAMP-based assays on time to signal detection. At low concentrations of RNA (7.25 copies/ L), the time to signal detection was 42.67 (  0.47) minutes for PCR, 11.25 (  0.20) minutes for LAMP, and 8.75 (  0.35) minutes for EXPAR.  At high (1450 copies/ L) concentrations of viral RNA, the time to signal detection was 34.00 (  0.00) minutes for PCR, 11.25 (  0.20) minutes for LAMP, and 3.08 (  0.42) minutes for EXPAR.Identification of the optimal sequence was clearly an important step in the development of the EXPAR method, and the sequence detected in the study, which comes from the Orf1ab gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, has been shown to be conserved in all current variants of COVID. However, the RTF-EXPAR method can be quickly adapted should new variants emerge, or for testing other viral pathogens such as Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), or Ebola, where near-patient testing is required to prevent more widespread transmission.  The assay has been tested at the Surgical Research Laboratory at the University of Birmingham. Professor Andrew Beggs, whose team conducted the testing, commented:   The testing used swabs containing a typical range of viral loads seen during the pandemic, and had a six-minute cut-off time.  The analysis showed RTF-EXPAR s sensitivity is equivalent to quantitative PCR testing, with a positive predictive value of 89%, and a negative predictive value of 93%.  We expect to publish the full results of this testing in the near future.  The team is now seeking commercial partners for rapid licensing, to make the RTF-EXPAR test as available as widely as possible.Reference: Carter JG, Orueta Iturbe L, Duprey J-LHA, et al.

However, current tests are limited by the tradeoff between accuracy and the time it takes to analyze a sample.Another challenge of current COVID-19 tests is cost. Most tests are expensive to produce and require trained personnel to administer and analyze them. Testing in low-and middle-income communities has therefore been largely inaccessible, leaving individuals at greater risk of viral spread.To address cost, time and accuracy, a new electrochemical test developed by Penn researchers uses electrodes made from graphite the same material found in pencil lead. Developed by C sar de la Fuente, Presidential Assistant Professor in Bioengineering, Microbiology and Psychiatry with a secondary appointment in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, these electrodes reduce the cost to $1.50 per test and require only 6.5 minutes to deliver 100-pecent-accurate results from saliva samples and up to 88 percent accuracy in nasal samples.While his previous research highlights the invention of RAPID (Real-time Accurate Portable Impedimetric Detection prototype 1.0), a COVID-19 testing kit which uses screen-printed electrodes, this new research published in PNAS presents LEAD (Low-cost Electrochemical Advanced Diagnostic), using the same concept as RAPID but with less expensive materials. De la Fuente's current test reduces costs from $4.67 per test (RAPID) to $1.50 per test (LEAD) just by changing the building material of the electrodes.""Both RAPID and LEAD work on the same principle of electrochemistry,"" says de la Fuente. ""However, LEAD is easier to assemble, it can be used by anyone and the materials are cheaper and more accessible than those of RAPID. This is important because we are using an abundant material, graphite, the same graphite used in pencils, to build the electrode to make testing more accessible to lower-income communities.""LEAD's functionalization and sample diagnosis take less than a few hours and can be made for a fraction of some of the most inexpensive tests on the market. Future steps for LEAD are twofold.""Currently, we are working to improve the technology and stability of our tests,"" says de la Fuente. ""We will always be looking for ways to make the most effective version of LEAD, but we are also working to find industry partners and conduct more clinical studies to push the use of LEAD for COVID testing as soon as possible.""While COVID-19 is the top priority, de la Fuente's tests can also detect other transmissible diseases, keeping this research relevant in the future.""Another area of future research for our test design is multiplexing, which will allow us to detect multiple viruses and bacteria in a sample,"" says de la Fuente. ""Once COVID is relatively controlled, we can use LEAD to detect the flu, Herpes, bacterial infections, and even certain biomarkers.""LEAD's cost and time efficiency may help it become one of, if not the first, electrochemical COVID-19 tests on the market in the near future and its fundamental process of sample detection could keep it on the market indefinitely.Reference: de Lima LF, Ferreira AL, Torres MDT, de Araujo WR, de la Fuente-Nunez C.

The method bypasses extraction of the virus  genetic RNA material, simplifying sample purification and potentially reducing test time and cost. The method is the result of a collaboration among researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI), the NIH Clinical Center (CC), and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).  Diagnostic testing remains a crucial tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Standard tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 involve amplifying viral RNA to detectable levels using a technique called quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). But first, the RNA must be extracted from the sample. Manufacturers of RNA extraction kits have had difficulty keeping up with demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, hindering testing capacity worldwide. With new virus variants emerging, the need for better, faster tests is greater than ever.A team led by Robert B. Hufnagel, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the NEI Medical Genetics and Ophthalmic Genomic Unit, and Bin Guan, Ph.D., a fellow at the Ophthalmic Genomics Laboratory at NEI, used a chelating agent made by the lab supply company Bio-Rad called Chelex 100 resin to preserve SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples for detection by RT-qPCR.  We used nasopharyngeal and saliva samples with various virion concentrations to evaluate whether they could be used for direct RNA detection,  said Guan, the lead author of a report on the technique, which published this week in iScience.  The answer was yes, with markedly high sensitivity. Also, this preparation inactivated the virus, making it safer for lab personnel to handle positive samples. Hufnagel s team made their discovery by testing a variety of chemicals using synthetic and human samples to identify those that could preserve the RNA in samples with minimal degradation while allowing direct detection of the virus by RT-qPCR.To validate the test, NIDCR s Blake M. Warner, D.D.S., Ph.D., M.P.H., and his team collected patient samples (on Research Protocol NIH IRB 20-D-0094) and stored them in either viral transport media, or the newly developed chelating-resin-buffer at the NIH Symptomatic Testing Facility.The samples in viral transport media were tested by the COVID-19 testing team at NIH s Clinical Center, led by Karen M. Frank, M.D., Ph.D., using conventional RNA extraction and RT-qPCR testing. The samples in the chelating-resin-buffer were heated and the viral RNA was, then, tested by RT-qPCR. The new preparation significantly increased the RNA yield available for testing, compared to the standard method. We think this novel methodology has clear benefits of increasing sensitivity, cost and time savings for testing,  said Hufnagel,  The method stabilizes the RNA at room temperature for easier transport, storage, and handling in clinical settings.

Up until this point, controlling electron spin qubits relied on us delivering microwave magnetic fields by putting a current through a wire right beside the qubit,  Dr Pla says. This poses some real challenges if we want to scale up to the millions of qubits that a quantum computer will need to solve globally significant problems, such as the design of new vaccines. First off, the magnetic fields drop off really quickly with distance, so we can only control those qubits closest to the wire. That means we would need to add more and more wires as we brought in more and more qubits, which would take up a lot of real estate on the chip. And since the chip must operate at freezing cold temperatures, below -270 C, Dr Pla says introducing more wires would generate way too much heat in the chip, interfering with the reliability of the qubits. So we come back to only being able to control a few qubits with this wire technique,  Dr Pla says.","Published: August 16, 2021"

If abnormal cells begin to outnumber normal cells, however, diseases may result. When mosaicism occurs in human sperm or egg cells, the mutations can affect both the man or woman with the mutation and subsequent generations.In a study publishing August 12, 2021 in Cell , researchers from the Rady Children s Institute of Genomic Medicine and University of California San Diego School of Medicine describe a new method for observing and counting these mutations, and using this data to predict the likely impact of these mutations on future children.Notably, they report that one in 15 men are likely to carry mutations in their sperm that could adversely affect their offspring.Previous research suggested that older men have a higher risk of certain diseases in their children, such as autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) and some forms of birth defects. In the latest study, researchers compared sperm from older men with younger men to ascertain any differences in mutations.They found that detectable mutations did not differ in number, suggesting these mutations create a stable risk of disease in offspring. The findings also indicated that age-associated mutations appear most likely to arise in single sperm cells, which occur below current levels of detection. Our earlier studies told us that sperm mutations contribute to the cause of disorders, such as autism and epilepsy, but the implications in men without a family history of disease was completely unknown,  said senior author Joseph Gleeson, MD, Rady Professor of Neuroscience at UC San Diego School of Medicine and director of neuroscience research at the Rady Children s Institute for Genomic Medicine.Researchers sequenced sperm in multiple samples hundreds of times across their entire genomes to find mutations presenting only in a small percentage of cells, using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We found that each ejaculate from a man shows an average of 30 mutations,  said co-first author Xiaoxu Yang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Gleeson s lab.  Almost all of these were found in serial sampling from a period of six to 12 months, whereas most of the mutations were completely absent from a saliva or blood sample.  The data, said Yang, indicates the mutations are restricted to sperm cells, and also validates their detection method. Surprisingly,  said co-first author Martin Breuss, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics-clinical genetics and metabolism at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a former postdoctoral scholar in the Gleeson lab,  the comparison between the old and young men showed few differences in mutations, telling us that these mutations probably arose when the father was an embryo, where the mutations could reside undetected until the man has children. Breuss said it also means that sperm cells are well-protected in a stem cell niche, which does a good job at maintaining stem cell populations and their relative contribution to each ejaculate. We think that these mutations contribute a substantial burden on human health,  said Gleeson,  potentially causing 15 percent of ASD cases, congenital heart disease and severe pediatric diseases. But we are hopeful that by identifying men at risk, future cases of disease can be avoided. Future research, said the authors, will focus on identifying the causes of the mutations arising in older men, and environmental exposures that might explain observed increases in mutations. The team is recruiting families where a child has a disease due to a new mutation, and where the father can donate a sperm sample to test for evidence of the mutation.

While that might not come as a surprise to some cat lovers, it does to cat behaviorists. Most animals prefer to work for their food   a behavior called contrafreeloading.A new study from researchers at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine showed most domestic cats choose not to contrafreeload. The study found that cats would rather eat from a tray of easily available food rather than work out a simple puzzle to get their food. There is an entire body of research that shows that most species including birds, rodents, wolves, primates   even giraffes   prefer to work for their food,  said lead author Mikel Delgado, a cat behaviorist and research affiliate at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.  What s surprising is out of all these species cats seem to be the only ones that showed no strong tendency to contrafreeload. In the study, Delgado, along with co-authors Melissa Bain and Brandon Han of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, provided 17 cats a food puzzle and a tray of food. The puzzle allowed the cats to easily see the food but required some manipulation to extract it. Some of the cats even had food puzzle experience. It wasn t that cats never used the food puzzle, but cats ate more food from the tray, spent more time at the tray and made more first choices to approach and eat from the tray rather than the puzzle,  said Delgado.

Now, a new study by Salk scientists has identified a group of neurons in the brainstem that plays a key role in this process.The findings, published June 8 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show how triggering specific receptors in these neurons causes opioid-induced respiratory depression, or OIRD, the disrupted breathing that causes overdose deaths. It also shows how blocking these receptors can cause OIRD to be reversed. The underlying mechanism of why opiates slow down and depress the breathing rhythm has not been fully characterized,  says senior investigator Sung Han, assistant professor in Salk s Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology.  This knowledge can provide a stepping stone to better treatment options for OIRD. The U.S. saw more than 93,000 overdose deaths in 2020, of which an estimated 60 percent were attributed to opioids like fentanyl. Opioids work by binding to proteins on nerve cells (neurons) called opioid receptors and subsequently inhibiting their activity. Currently, naloxone is the only medication known to block the effects of opioids and reverse an overdose. But naloxone has limitations, including a short duration that requires it to be administered multiple times. It also works systemically, blocking opioid receptors throughout the entire body, including those that control pain.To develop strategies to rescue OIRD with more specificity, Han s team set out to search for the breathing neurons in the brain that also carry opioid receptors. In the new study, the researchers identified a group of neurons that express a certain type of opioid receptor (the mu opoid receptor) and are located in the brainstem breathing modulation center; they then characterized these neurons  role in OIRD.They found that mice that were genetically engineered to lack opioid receptors in these neurons didn t have their breathing disrupted when exposed to morphine, as mice in the control group did. The researchers also found that, without introducing opioids, stimulating these receptors in control mice caused symptoms of OIRD.The team then looked at ways to reverse the process by treating the overdosed mice with chemical compounds targeted to other receptors on the same neurons, which play an opposite role as the opioid receptor (activating rather than inhibiting them). We discovered four different chemical compounds that successfully activated these neurons and brought back the breathing rate during OIRD,  said first author Shijia Liu, a graduate student in the Han lab. Recovery in overdosed mice was close to 100 percent, which surprised the team.The researchers next plan to look at whether other cell groups also play a role in OIRD. Further study would also examine the connection between breathing regulation and pain perception in the brain, potentially opening the door to developing more targeted treatments for OIRD.""We hope to explain the pain-breathing segregation at the molecular or microcircuit level,  says Han, who holds the Pioneer Fund Development Chair.  By doing that, we can try to restore breathing without touching analgesic effects of opioids. Reference: Liu S, Kim D-I, Oh TG, et al.

As a result, plant scientists are in a race against time to engineer crops with higher yields by improving photosynthesis.Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) are known to photosynthesize more efficiently than most crops, so researchers are working to put elements from cyanobacteria into crop plants.A new study describes a significant step towards achieving that goal.  Absence of Carbonic Anhydrase in Chloroplasts Affects C3 Plant Development but Not Photosynthesis,  published August 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Maureen Hanson, a Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor of Plant Molecular Biology, is the paper s senior author. Kevin Hines, Ph.D.  19, a former student in Hanson s lab, and Vishal Chaudhari, a postdoctoral associate in Hanson s lab, are co-first authors.When plants photosynthesize they convert carbon dioxide, water and light into oxygen and sucrose, a sugar used for energy and for building new tissues. During this process, Rubisco, an enzyme found in all plants, takes inorganic carbon from the air and  fixes  or converts it to an organic form the plant uses to build tissues.One hurdle in improving photosynthesis in crops is that Rubisco reacts with both carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air; the latter reaction creates toxic byproducts, slows photosynthesis and thereby lowers yields. But in cyanobacteria, the Rubisco is contained within microcompartments called carboxysomes that shield the Rubisco from oxygen.The carboxysome additionally allows the cyanobacteria to concentrate carbon dioxide so Rubisco can use it for faster carbon fixation, Hanson said.  Crop plants don t have carboxysomes, so the idea is to eventually put in the entire carbon-concentrating mechanism from cyanobacteria into crop plants,  she added.To engineer this system to work in crop plants, scientists must remove carbonic anhydrase, a naturally occurring enzyme, from the chloroplasts, organelles in plant cells where photosynthesis occurs. That s because anhydrase s role is to create an equilibrium between CO2 and bicarbonate in plant cells, by catalyzing reactions in which CO2 and water form bicarbonate and vice versa. But in order for the carbon-concentrating mechanism from cyanobacteria to work in crops, bicarbonate in the system must reach levels many times higher than those found at equilibrium. So in this study,  Hanson said,  we did that step [of removing anhydrase] that s going to be needed to make the carboxysome work. In the paper, the authors describe using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to disable genes that express two carbonic anhydrase enzymes that are present in chloroplasts. In the past, another research group had used a different method to remove 99% of the anhydrase enzyme s activity, and the plants grew normally. But when Hanson and colleagues removed 100% of the enzyme s activity, the plants barely grew.  It showed that plants need this enzyme to make bicarbonate that is used in pathways to make components of leaf tissue,  Hanson said.When they put the plants into a high CO2 growth chamber, they resumed normal growth, as the high amounts of CO2 resulted in a spontaneous reaction to form bicarbonate.The team believes they have a workaround to remove anhydrase and still have enough bicarbonate. In future research, recently funded by a three-year, close to $800,000 National Science Foundation grant, they plan to put a bicarbonate transporter on the chloroplast membrane, in order to import bicarbonate from other parts of the cell into chloroplasts. As well as making anhydrase unnecessary, the extra bicarbonate is expected to improve photosynthesis even before carboxysomes can be engineered into chloroplasts.Experiments showed that the absence of carbonic anhydrase did not interfere with photosynthesis, contrary to previously held views.A potential problem is that carbonic anhydrase found in chloroplasts is known to be involved in the plant s defense pathways. However, researchers in Hanson s group discovered they could incorporate an enzymatically inactive version of the carbonic anhydrase and still maintain the plant s defense. We now know we can make an inactive enzyme that won t affect our carbon concentrating mechanism but will still allow the crop plants to be resistant to viruses,  Hanson said.The study was funded by the Synthetic Biology Program of the National Science Foundation.Reference: Hines KM, Chaudhari V, Edgeworth KN, Owens TG, Hanson MR.

The longer and stronger the polymer, the more durable the material.Cornell researchers took a middling monomer and, by using a special catalyst, they created a tougher polymer that can form long chains. The polymer can then be easily depolymerized back to the monomer state with an acid catalyst, resulting in a chemically recyclable thermoplastic that competes with the most popular plastics, polyethylene and polypropylene.The team s paper,  Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastics from Reversible-Deactivation Polymerization of Cyclic Acetals,  published Aug. 13 in Science.The co-lead authors are former postdoctoral researcher Brooks Abel and Rachel Snyder, Ph.D.  21. Ideally, the perfect polymer is one that has really high initial stresses and then it undergoes really good elongation,  said Geoffrey Coates, the Tisch University Professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, and the paper s senior author.  The polymers you ve probably heard of, polyethylene and polypropylene, they just have great properties. A lot of new polymers don t compare well with these tried-and-true ones. Our polymer is right in the middle of the pack. It has been around for 60 or 70 years, but no one s been able to make really long chains of it and get really good properties. In an unexpected twist, the discovery didn t emerge from conventional plastics research but rather from the Coates Group s involvement with the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, an interdisciplinary collaboration launched by the U.S. Department of Energy to realize next-generation batteries. Coates and his team had been working to develop sustainable polymers that can be used in energy storage and conversion materials when they realized their polymer   poly(1,3-dioxolane) or PDXL   was well-suited for creating a thermoplastic   a material with properties that allow it to be melted, recycled and remolded.The researchers built their polymer from a cyclic acetal monomer called dioxolane, which is synthesized from potentially biorenewable formaldehyde and ethylene glycol feedstocks. Polyacetals are strong candidates for creating recyclable thermoplastics because they are stable upward of 300 degrees Celsius, but depolymerize at relatively low temperatures   usually below 150 degrees Celsius   in the presence of an acid catalyst. They are also inexpensive and can be biologically sourced. However, polyacetals have not seen prior use because the polymer chains are generally too short to achieve the mechanical strength necessary for commercial applications. We wanted to develop a new way to make polyacetals that would give us control over the length of the polymer chains,  Abel said.  Ultimately, we were able to make really high molecular weight polyacetals that were surprisingly ductile and strong as compared to their more brittle, low molecular weight counterparts. If you want to make a cup that doesn t crack when you flex it, you need to get really high molecular weight,  Coates said.Using a process called reversible-deactivation cationic ring-opening polymerization, the researchers were able to connect the monomers into long chains of PDXL that have high molecular weight and high tensile strength.The resulting thermoplastic is strong and flexible enough to be used for large-scale applications such as packaging products. The team demonstrated this potential by creating several prototype items, including protective pouches, molded packaging and inflatable air pillows of the sort Amazon uses to pad their boxes. Right now, nearly 40% of plastic is produced for packaging products that are used briefly and then disposed,  Snyder said.  PDXL has the necessary strength for packaging, but instead of throwing it away, we can collect and repurpose it using a very efficient chemical recycling process. This makes it a perfect candidate for a circular polymer economy. The recycling process is so efficient that PDXL can even be depolymerized from complex mixtures of plastic waste. The team mixed PDXL with other commodity plastics like polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polystyrene. After applying a reusable acid catalyst and heat, they were able to recover 96% of the pure dioxolane monomer, demonstrating that it can be easily isolated from common contaminants like dyes and plasticizers. The recovered monomer was then repolymerized to PDXL, illustrating the circularity of polyacetal chemical recycling.This points to the polymer s most significant attribute: its sustainability. It takes a lot of fossil fuels to make these plastics, and the carbon footprint of common polyethylene or polypropylene is really bad. So we ve got to be better at how we make them,  Coates said.  If you can have a way that you can chemically recycle the polymer, it s not going to go in the ocean, right? And then instead of using all this energy to take oil out of the ground and break it up in little pieces and spend all this energy, all we have to do is just heat up the polymer and boom, we have a monomer again.

Although plague has been largely eradicated in the developed world, it still affects hundreds of people globally each year.When a human is infected with bubonic plague from a flea bite and it goes untreated, the infection can progress and spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonic plague. The most feared clinical form of plague, pneumonic plague is typically lethal if not quickly treated, and infected patients can transmit the disease to others via respiratory droplets. A team of scientists from Northern Arizona University s Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, led by professor Dave Wagner, recently published their findings from a remarkable study involving antimicrobial resistant (AMR) plague. Although pneumonic plague outbreaks are now extremely rare, scientists consider plague to be a reemerging and neglected disease, particularly in the East African island country of Madagascar, which reports the majority of annual global cases. With no vaccine against it, preventing mortality from plague requires rapid diagnosis followed by treatment with antibiotics. An AMR strain of Y. pestis resistant to the antibiotic streptomycin, usually the first-line treatment for plague in Madagascar was isolated from a pneumonic plague outbreak that occurred there in 2013, involving 22 cases, including three fatalities. Wagner s team, including PMI senior research scientists Dawn Birdsell and Nawarat Somprasong, PMI assistant director Amy Vogler, professor Herbert Schweizer, associate professor Jason Sahl and senior research coordinator Carina Hall, conducted a study of this outbreak, together with long-term research partners at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and scientists at the Institute Pasteur Paris and the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health. The results of the study,  Transmission of antimicrobial resistant Yersinia pestis during a pneumonic plague outbreak,  were recently published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.  By characterizing the outbreak using epidemiology, clinical diagnostics and DNA-fingerprinting approaches,  Wagner said,  we determined for the first time that AMR strains of Y. pestis can be transmitted person-to-person. The AMR strain from this outbreak is resistant to streptomycin due to a spontaneous point mutation, but is still susceptible to many other antibiotics, including co-trimoxazole. Luckily, the 19 cases that were treated all received co-trimoxazole in addition to streptomycin, and all of them survived.  The point mutation, which also is the source of streptomycin resistance in other bacterial species, has occurred independently in Y. pestis at least three times and appears to have no negative effect on the AMR strain, suggesting that it could potentially persist in nature via the natural rodent-flea transmission cycle. However, AMR Y. pestis strains are exceedingly rare and the mutation has not been observed again in Madagascar since this outbreak. ReferenceAndrianaivoarimanana V, Wagner DM, Birdsell DN, et al.

Nearly a quarter of methane emissions can be attributed to agriculture, much of which is from raising livestock. Rice cultivation and food waste are also important sources of agricultural methane, as nearly a third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted.At NASA, scientists study the global methane budget to better understand the primary sources of methane emissions and how they contribute to climate change. In addition to the human sources, methane is also produced in natural settings. The greatest natural source of methane is wetlands, which contribute 30% of global methane emissions. Other natural sources of methane emissions include the oceans, termites, permafrost, vegetation and wildfires.Atmospheric methane concentrations have more than doubled since the Industrial Revolution because of intensive use of oil, gas and coal, rising demand for beef and dairy products and increased production of food and organic waste. Although the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations slowed appreciably near the end of the 20th Century, concentrations have been increasing substantially since 2006, likely as a result of rising emissions from raising livestock, renewed reliance on natural gas and, in recent years, wetlands and global warming.","Published: August 16, 2021"

Lennon and his laboratory could help researchers answer questions pertaining to chronic infections, the functioning of bacteria in the environment and the persistence of life itself.In a paper published online Aug. 12 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Lennon and his colleagues explain their study of about 100 populations of different bacteria in closed systems, which had no access to external food for 1,000 days. The team tracked how long they survived, and almost all of them persisted. ""The larger question of how bacteria survive long periods of energy limitation is relevant to understanding chronic infections in humans and other hosts, and is related to how some pathogens tolerate drugs like antibiotics,"" said Lennon, a professor in the Department of Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences at IU Bloomington. Many bacterial infections are difficult to treat, in part, because drugs are often designed to target the cellular machinery of metabolically active cells. Energy-limited bacteria often enter a quiescent, or dormant, state that makes them less sensitive to drug treatments, Lennon said. Not only can the pathogens persist under such conditions, the populations can also evolve antibiotic resistance, making the problem worse. Microbes also play an important role in the environment. The bacteria in the study came from agricultural soils. In those habitats, Lennon said, microbes form symbiotic relationships with plants, and they carry out processes that are essential for the functioning of ecosystems, such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. A major and unresolved question is how billions of microbial cells and thousands of microbial taxa coexist in a single gram of soil, often under harsh environmental conditions. One explanation supported by the research is that microbes seem to be well-adapted to feast-or-famine conditions, where resources can be in short supply for extended periods. This may help explain how complex microbial communities are maintained over time. In the study, Lennon and his colleagues estimated that bacteria, which are the fastest-reproducing organisms on the planet, can also be extremely long-lived. Lennon and his team, including former Indiana University doctoral student William Shoemaker, estimated that energy-limited bacteria can have lifespans that rival, and in some cases exceed, those of plants and animals. The study used survival analyses to estimate that some populations have extinction times of up to 100,000 years. ""Obviously, these predictions extend far beyond what can be measured,"" Lennon said, ""but the numbers are consistent with the ages of viable bacteria that have been recovered from ancient materials, such as amber, halite crystals, permafrost and sediments at the bottom of the deepest oceans."" The persistence of microbes under such conditions likely involves dormancy and other mechanisms that conserve energy. For example, Lennon and colleagues found that the survival of cells in their closed system was sustained by the ability of bacteria to ""scavenge"" their dead relatives. Under these lean conditions, where cells must eke out a living on vanishingly small quantities of food, Lennon and his team were curious about the potential for bacteria to evolve. They identified genes that were under negative selection, but also signatures of positive selection, which indicate cryptic growth that allowed new mutations to increase in frequency. This finding suggests that the recycling of dead cells has the potential to fuel adaptive evolution. Such observations are relevant for understanding the constraints on fundamental biological processes given that large swaths of the planet are energy limited.ReferenceShoemaker WR, Jones SE, Muscarella ME, Behringer MG, Lehmkuhl BK, Lennon JT.

Accurate quantification of NH3 emissions from agricultural ecosystems is essential for the understanding of NH3 budgets at regional to global scales as well as for the control and mitigation strategies on air pollution.Scientists at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their collaborators from Ningbo HealthyPhoton Co., Ltd. have developed a portable and solar-powered open-path NH3 analyzer (model: HT8700). This analyzer is specifically designed for NH3 flux measurement based on the eddy covariance (EC) method, the most direct and effective way to measure NH3 exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The team investigated the analyzer's suitability to measure NH3 fluxes through laboratory and field experiments and published their study in Agricultural and Forest Meteorology. A flux system based on the EC method requires an NH3 analyzer with high sensitivity and fast response. For the conventional closed-path NH3 instruments, the surface adsorption effect of NH3 causes longer response time and therefore introduce measurement bias. Meanwhile, the sampling pumps for the closed-path systems usually require high power consumption, which makes them not feasible in field deployments particularly in places where grid power is not readily available. ""The availability of the new instrument for the flux community allows us to monitor the NH3 flux, both emissions and depositions, at different types of ecosystems."" said Dr. WANG Kai, the lead author of the work. The HT8700 NH3 analyzer is based on the state-of-art quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) technique. Its open-path design overcomes the challenges faced by the close-path instruments. With good performance in terms of response time, precision and stability, this instrument is an ideal tool for NH3 flux measurements based on the EC technique. ""The field experiment proved the importance of open-path design for NH3 flux observation, but we think there are more opportunities for improvement in the future."" said Dr. WANG Yin, one of the study's co-authors, CEO of HealthyPhoton Co., Ltd. ""its data availability is largely constrained by frequent reductions in the laser signal intensity, because the optical mirrors are directly exposed to the environment.

Like human families, the individual cells of a tumor share some common traits and characteristics, but as the tumor expands, the cells also develop their own identities. And, as a result, some cells are more resistant to therapy than others and quicker to adapt and change.A team of researchers at The University of Texas at Austin developed a new way to tag tumor cells to figure out how they evolve and change over time to resist cancer treatments. They studied chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily, but these findings could help researchers learn more about the entire spectrum of cancerous tumors. This is a technology that lets you replay the evolutionary history of the tumor,  said Amy Brock, an associate professor in the Cockrell School's Department of Biomedical Engineering and co-lead author on a new paper published in Nature Cancer.  We can collect those pre-resistant cells and go back and look at what happened to them. We can try many parallel treatments and measure how specific cells respond and which ones persist.""The ability to essentially ""tag"" nucleic acids   the genetic information of the cell such as RNA or DNA   to monitor them is not a brand-new technology. However, current capabilities don't paint a full picture of how tumor cells evolve. What this platform, known as ClonMapper, can do that wasn't possible before is look backward and trace how tumor cells change over time. That gives researchers the ability to look at which cells ""win out"" over less resistant cells, continue to clone themselves and make the tumor more dangerous. By isolating these cells, researchers can better test which treatments do and don't work against them.Monitoring changes over time is key to successful transfer treatments. Tumor cells adjust to treatments and become resistant. That's why patients can go into remission, but later experience relapse.""This is one of reasons cancer treatment is so challenging   we don't have very good ways of predicting ahead of time which cells will be sensitive to a type of drug and which ones will be resistant,  Brock said.  This acquired resistance is a leading cause of treatment failure for many patients with cancer. CLL is a low-grade B-cell malignancy that is often monitored for months or even years before it requires active treatment. This ""watch and wait"" style of treatment relies heavily on accurate monitoring of the patient. In the study, ClonMapper focused on identifying which cells were cloning themselves, how fast this process happened and how it influences the growth rate of surrounding cells over time. This allowed a much more accurate analysis of the cell population and may enable more customized treatment plans for patients.The ClonMapper study was led by researchers from UT Austin and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute. The UT Austin team includes from the Cockrell School and College of Natural Sciences Aziz M. Al Khafaji, Eric Brenner, Kaitlyn E. Johnson and Russell E.

The enzyme APOBEC3A is a vital part of the innate immune system that works to protect cells from viral infection by inducing mutations to block viruses from replicating. However, APOBEC3A also induces mutations by directly attacking the genome of cancer cells, which results in increased levels of DNA mutations that lead to cancer progression, metastasis and drug resistance.  In our previous studies, we demonstrated that APOBEC3A-induced DNA mutations are very frequent in cancer patients.

Titled,  Genotoxic Stress and Viral Infection Induce Transient Expression of APOBEC3A and Pro-Inflammatory Genes Through Two Distinct Pathways,  the study was published today in Nature Communications.In this study, graduate student Sunwoo Oh and Elodie Bournique, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow, both at UCI School of Medicine, characterized how both viral infection and genotoxic stress caused by chemotherapeutic drugs transiently up-regulate APOBEC3A.  Their work illustrates how viral infection triggers a specific innate immune response to activate APOBEC3A expression in human cells and how it is an important step in the elimination of the virus. Their work also illustrates how different chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate APOBEC3A, but through a completely different type of immune response which, this time, causes mutations that further enhance cancer aggressivity. Together, our results reveal different ways for the cells to regulate APOBEC3A expression to address different types of stresses that the cell may encounter,  said Buisson.  By understanding how cancer cells and viral infections regulate APOBEC3A expression, we are poised to take critical step forward toward the development of both new therapeutic strategies to fight cancer and new anti-viral therapies.  More work is needed to develop strategies to prevent the formation of DNA mutations caused by APOBEC3A in the cancer genome that increase tumor heterogeneity, promoting disease progression and resistance to therapies. With regard to viral infections, the next step is to determine whether certain types of mutations previously detected in viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are the result of APOBEC3A activity and affect the replication of the virus in the cells.This study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, California Breast Cancer Research Program, Concern Foundation, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the U.S. Public Health Service.Reference: Oh S, Bournique E, Bowen D. et al.

The findings have spurred investigators to open a clinical trial of the drug, novobiocin, for patients whose tumors carry the abnormality.In a study in the journal Nature Cancer, the researchers found that in laboratory cell lines and tumor models novobiocin selectively killed tumor cells with abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which help repair damaged DNA. The drug was effective even in tumors resistant to agents known as PARP inhibitors, which have become a prime therapy for cancers with DNA-repair glitches. PARP inhibitors represent an important advance in the treatment of cancers with defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes involved in DNA repair. By allowing tumor cells to accumulate additional genetic damage, they essentially incapacitate the cells and cause them to die,  says Alan D Andrea, MD, director of the Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers and the Center for DNA Damage and Repair at Dana-Farber and co-senior author of the study with Raphael Ceccaldi, PhD, PharmD, of the Curie Institute in Paris.  They are effective for many patients, but the cancer eventually becomes resistant and begins growing again. Drugs capable of overcoming that resistance are urgently needed.  D Andrea added.BRCA mutations   whether inherited or acquired   are found in a sizeable percentage of breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. The discovery of novobiocin s effectiveness in PARP inhibitor-resistant tumors arose when two strands of research converged on a key enzyme in tumor cells.In a study published in 2015, D Andrea and his colleagues found that tumors with poorly functioning BRCA1 and -2 genes are overdependent for their growth and survival on an enzyme known as POL , or POLQ. For the new study, they screened thousands of molecules   some new, some used in approved drugs   in BRCA-deficient tumors to see if any had an effect on tumor growth. The screenings were conducted in laboratory cell lines, in organoids   three dimensional cultures of tumor tissue   and in animal models.Of the multitude of molecules and drugs tested, one stood out for its ability to kill the tumor cells while leaving normal cells unharmed   novobiocin. The protein that novobiocin targets within cells was eminently familiar to researchers   POLQ, specifically, a portion known as the ATPase domain.When investigators looked into the medical literature on novobiocin, they found a surprise, D Andrea relates. Though developed and used as an antibiotic, it had been tested in the early 1990s in a clinical trial for patients with hard-to-treat cancers. While most of the patients didn t benefit from the drug, a small number had their cancer recede or stabilize. At the time, no one knew what the drug s target was,  D Andrea remarks.  Now we do, and, as a result, we have an indication of which patients are likely to be helped by it. On the basis of the study results, Dana-Farber investigators will be launching a clinical trial of novobiocin for patients with BRCA-deficient cancers that have acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors. Because it is an oral drug that is safe and approved for treating another disease, novobiocin offers several advantages as an agent for study, D Andrea comments. We re looking forward to testing novobiocin, alone and in combination with other agents, in patients whose tumors have molecular characteristics indicating a likely response to the drug,  D Andrea says.Reference: Zhou J, Gelot C, Pantelidou C, et al.

When these Cas9-fused proteins are applied to a microchip sporting thousands of unique DNA molecules, each protein within the mixture will self-assemble to the position on the chip containing its corresponding DNA sequence. The researchers have called this technique  PICASSO , short for peptide immobilization by Cas9-mediated self-organization. By then applying a blood sample to the PICASSO microarray, the proteins on the microchip that are recognized by patient antibodies can be identified.The team led by Dr. Stephen Elledge at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women s Hospital, Boston, has published the research online in Molecular Cell. The paper s first author, Dr. Karl Barber, is a 2018 Schmidt Science Fellow, with much of the work to develop the technology taking place during his Fellowship Research Placement in corresponding author Dr. Elledge s laboratory.Describing PICASSO, Dr. Barber said:  Imagine you want to paint a picture on a canvas, but instead of painting in a normal fashion, you mix all of your paints together, splash it on the canvas, and the perfect picture emerges. With our new technique, you place DNA molecules at defined locations on a surface and each protein from a mixture will then self-assemble to its corresponding DNA sequence, like an automated paint-by-number kit. The resulting DNA-templated protein microarrays allow you to quickly identify antibodies in clinical samples that recognize whatever proteins you are interested in. The research team has demonstrated that the technology works to assemble thousands of different proteins, suggesting that it could be readily adapted as a broad-spectrum medical diagnostic tool. In the paper, they used the technique to detect antibodies binding to proteins derived from pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, from the blood of recovering COVID-19 patients.Dr. Barber said:  In this work, we demonstrated the application of PICASSO for protein studies, creating a tool that we believe could be quickly adapted for medical diagnostics. Our protein self-assembly technique could also be harnessed for the development of new biomaterials and biosensors just by attaching DNA targets to a scaffold and allowing Cas9-linked proteins to bind. Group Leader, Dr. Elledge, commented:  One of the most exciting aspects of this work is the demonstration of how CRISPR can be applied in an entirely new setting. Previously, CRISPR has been used primarily for gene editing and the detection of DNA or RNA. PICASSO brings the power of CRISPR into a new realm of protein studies, and the molecular self-assembly strategy we show may assist in developing new research and diagnostic tools.""Dr. Megan Kenna, Executive Director of Schmidt Science Fellows, said:  This technology has the potential to be used as a medical diagnostic tool that could, one day, provide doctors with a way to quickly determine the diagnosis and best course of treatment for each individual patient.   The way that Karl and the research team have brought together fundamental biology with molecular engineering to make this important discovery shows why the interdisciplinarity at the heart of our Fellowship is so critical to advancing science.

Now, the same research group has published a study in The Lancet Oncology, which shows that the addition of a novel blood test, the Stockholm3 test, can reduce the number of MRIs performed by a third while further preventing the detection of minor, low-risk tumours. Overall, our studies show that we have identified the tools needed to be able to carry out effective and safe screening for prostate cancer. After many years of debate and research, it feels fantastic to be able to present knowledge that can improve healthcare for men,  says Tobias Nordstr m, associate professor of urology at the Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital at Karolinska Institutet, who is responsible for the STHLM3MRI study.Current screening methods   PSA (prostate-specific antigen) tests combined with traditional biopsies   result in unnecessary biopsies and the detection of numerous minor, low-risk tumours (overdiagnosis). Consequently, no country except Lithuania has chosen to introduce a nationwide prostate cancer screening programme, as the benefits do not outweigh the disadvantages.On July 9 2021, results from the STHLM3MRI study were presented in The New England Journal of Medicine, indicating that overdiagnosis could be reduced by substituting traditional prostate biopsies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies. The new results, now published in The Lancet Oncology, show that the addition of the Stockholm3 test, which was developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, can be an important complement. It is a blood test that uses an algorithm to analyse a combination of protein markers, genetic markers and clinical data. The availability of MRI in healthcare will be a limiting factor. We now show that a novel blood test as adjunct to MRI can reduce the number of MRIs performed by a third. Compared with traditional screening, overdiagnosis is reduced by as much as 69 percent. At the same time, the number of biopsies is halved, while we can find just as many clinically significant tumours , says Martin Eklund, associate professor at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, with joint responsibility for the STHLM3MRI study.STHLM3MRI is a randomised study that was conducted between 2018 and 2021 with 12,750 male participants from Stockholm County. The participants provided an initial blood sample for PSA analysis and analysis using the new Stockholm3 test. Men with test results showing elevated PSA levels were then randomly selected for traditional biopsies or MRI. In the MRI group, biopsies were conducted strictly on suspected tumours identified by MRI. Separate use of the Stockholm3 test and MRI has previously been shown to be cost-effective. We have now analysed the cost-effectiveness when these tools are combined and will shortly report exciting results from that analysis,  Tobias Nordstr m concludes.Reference: Nordstr m T, Discacciati A, Bergman M, Clements M, Aly M, Annerstedt M, et al.

BEE-STEWARD   which is freely available online   is a powerful tool that can make bumblebee survival predictions, according to a new study. We know that pollinator decline is a really big problem for crops and also for wildflowers,  said Dr Grace Twiston-Davies, of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.  BEE-STEWARD takes into account the many complicated factors that interact to affect bumblebees. This provides a virtual safe space to test out different bee-friendly management options."" It s a free, user-friendly tool and we have worked with land managers and wildlife groups on the ground to create it together. Disentangling the many factors that affect bumblebee colonies is incredibly complicated, meaning real-word testing of different methods by land managers is often not feasible.  This problem prompted the Exeter scientists to create the BEEHAVE (honeybees) and Bumble-BEEHAVE (Bumblebees) computer models. But to help bumblebees thrive across our landscapes, these tools need to be used by people on the ground and not just scientists.BEE-STEWARD has been designed with and for land managers, farmers and conservation practitioners to test out different ideas for land management and predict the impact that these may have on bumblebee survival.BEE-STEWARD is being used by the Bumblebee Conservation Trust to help test and guide land management to help bumblebees and farm business thrive in Cornwall. Using BEE-STEWARD, bee-friendly actions are being tested across 1,500 ha of land in collaboration with the Duchy of Cornwall Estate, the National Trust, Treiwthen Dairy and Kellys of Cornwall.BEE-STEWARD can simulate the growth, behaviour and survival of UK bumblebee species living in a landscape providing various nectar and pollen sources to forage on. The BEE-STEWARD model is a significant step towards enabling practitioners to support bumblebee populations,  said Professor Juliet Osborne, who leads the team. The tool can be used to inform conservation and farming decisions and for assigning bespoke management recommendations. Professor Osborne and team won the BBSRC Social Innovator of the Year 2017 award for creating the BEEHAVE models.""We have worked with researchers and landowners who have been using the model and have given us valuable feedback so we could improve our models further"" said model developer Dr Matthias Becher. Testing the BEE-STEWARD tool has helped us predict how best to provide new and improved habitat for pollinators in an informed way, considering existing and proposed flora, flowering times and location.  This has focused decision making by identifying pollinator habitats that are lacking in a particular landscape, enabling us to focus our attention to improve and protect these specific areas  Ashley Taylor, Assistant Land Steward, Duchy of Cornwall EstateBEE-STEWARD could be an important virtual test-bed for scientists exploring the impacts of different stressors on bumblebees and used by those with little or no modelling experience.

BCI systems depend on implantable sensors that record electrical signals in the brain and use those signals to drive external devices like computers or robotic prosthetics.Most current BCI systems use one or two sensors to sample up to a few hundred neurons, but neuroscientists are interested in systems that are able to gather data from much larger groups of brain cells.Now, a team of researchers has taken a key step toward a new concept for a future BCI system   one that employs a coordinated network of independent, wireless microscale neural sensors, each about the size of a grain of salt, to record and stimulate brain activity. The sensors, dubbed  neurograins,  independently record the electrical pulses made by firing neurons and send the signals wirelessly to a central hub, which coordinates and processes the signals.In a study published on August 12 in Nature Electronics, the research team demonstrated the use of nearly 50 such autonomous neurograins to record neural activity in a rodent.The results, the researchers say, are a step toward a system that could one day enable the recording of brain signals in unprecedented detail, leading to new insights into how the brain works and new therapies for people with brain or spinal injuries. One of the big challenges in the field of brain-computer interfaces is engineering ways of probing as many points in the brain as possible,  said Arto Nurmikko, a professor in Brown s School of Engineering and the study s senior author.  Up to now, most BCIs have been monolithic devices   a bit like little beds of needles. Our team s idea was to break up that monolith into tiny sensors that could be distributed across the cerebral cortex. That s what we ve been able to demonstrate here. The team, which includes experts from Brown, Baylor University, University of California at San Diego and Qualcomm, began the work of developing the system about four years ago. The challenge was two-fold, said Nurmikko, who is affiliated with Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science. The first part required shrinking the complex electronics involved in detecting, amplifying and transmitting neural signals into the tiny silicon neurograin chips. The team first designed and simulated the electronics on a computer, and went through several fabrication iterations to develop operational chips.The second challenge was developing the body-external communications hub that receives signals from those tiny chips. The device is a thin patch, about the size of a thumb print, that attaches to the scalp outside the skull. It works like a miniature cellular phone tower, employing a network protocol to coordinate the signals from the neurograins, each of which has its own network address. The patch also supplies power wirelessly to the neurograins, which are designed to operate using a minimal amount of electricity. This work was a true multidisciplinary challenge,  said Jihun Lee, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown and the study s lead author.  We had to bring together expertise in electromagnetics, radio frequency communication, circuit design, fabrication and neuroscience to design and operate the neurograin system. The goal of this new study was to demonstrate that the system could record neural signals from a living brain   in this case, the brain of a rodent. The team placed 48 neurograins on the animal s cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, and successfully recorded characteristic neural signals associated with spontaneous brain activity.The team also tested the devices  ability to stimulate the brain as well as record from it. Stimulation is done with tiny electrical pulses that can activate neural activity. The stimulation is driven by the same hub that coordinates neural recording and could one day restore brain function lost to illness or injury, researchers hope.The size of the animal s brain limited the team to 48 neurograins for this study, but the data suggest that the current configuration of the system could support up to 770. Ultimately, the team envisions scaling up to many thousands of neurograins, which would provide a currently unattainable picture of brain activity.""It was a challenging endeavor, as the system demands simultaneous wireless power transfer and networking at the mega-bit-per-second rate, and this has to be accomplished under extremely tight silicon area and power constraints,  said Vincent Leung, an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Baylor.  Our team pushed the envelope for distributed neural implants. There s much more work to be done to make that complete system a reality, but researchers said this study represents a key step in that direction. Our hope is that we can ultimately develop a system that provides new scientific insights into the brain and new therapies that can help people affected by devastating injuries,  Nurmikko said.Reference: Lee J, Leung V, Lee A-H, et al.

We are interested in understanding cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation. In this study, we wanted to know if a short nap during the deprivation period would mitigate these deficits,  said Kimberly Fenn, associate professor of MSU, study author and director of MSU s Sleep and Learning Lab.  We found that short naps of 30 or 60 minutes did not show any measurable effects. The study was published in the journal Sleep and is among the first to measure the effectiveness of shorter naps   which are often all people have time to fit into their busy schedules. While short naps didn t show measurable effects on relieving the effects of sleep deprivation, we found that the amount of slow-wave sleep that participants obtained during the nap was related to reduced impairments associated with sleep deprivation,  Fenn said.Slow-wave sleep, or SWS, is the deepest and most restorative stage of sleep. It is marked by high amplitude, low frequency brain waves and is the sleep stage when your body is most relaxed; your muscles are at ease, and your heart rate and respiration are at their slowest. SWS is the most important stage of sleep,  Fenn said.  When someone goes without sleep for a period of time, even just during the day, they build up a need for sleep; in particular, they build up a need for SWS. When individuals go to sleep each night, they will soon enter into SWS and spend a substantial amount of time in this stage. Fenn s research team   including MSU colleague Erik Altmann, professor of psychology, and Michelle Stepan, a recent MSU alumna currently working at the University of Pittsburgh - recruited 275 college-aged participants for the study.The participants completed cognitive tasks when arriving at MSU s Sleep and Learning Lab in the evening and were then randomly assigned to three groups:  The first was sent home to sleep; the second stayed at the lab overnight and had the opportunity to take either a 30 or a 60 minute nap; and the third did not nap at all in the deprivation condition.The next morning, participants reconvened in the lab to repeat the cognitive tasks, which measured attention and placekeeping, or the ability to complete a series of steps in a specific order without skipping or repeating them   even after being interrupted. The group that stayed overnight and took short naps still suffered from the effects of sleep deprivation and made significantly more errors on the tasks than their counterparts who went home and obtained a full night of sleep,  Fenn said.  However, every 10-minute increase in SWS reduced errors after interruptions by about 4%. These numbers may seem small but when considering the types of errors that are likely to occur in sleep-deprived operators   like those of surgeons, police officers or truck drivers   a 4% decrease in errors could potentially save lives, Fenn said. Individuals who obtained more SWS tended to show reduced errors on both tasks. However, they still showed worse performance than the participants who slept,  she said.Fenn hopes that the findings underscore the importance of prioritizing sleep and that naps   even if they include SWS   cannot replace a full night of sleep.Reference: Stepan ME, Altmann EM, Fenn KM.

Several checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 have been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. However, many patients do not respond well to this therapy creating a need for alternative treatment options.Researchers in Moffitt Cancer Center s Lung Cancer Center of Excellence believe a combination of checkpoint inhibitors with adoptive cell therapy could be the answer for these patients. Results of their investigator-initiated phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in combination with tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy was published today in Nature Medicine.Non-small cell lung cancer tumors are often categorized as a  cold  tumor, meaning the tumor has not been infiltrated with immune cells making it hard to mount a response to immunotherapy. These results really give hope to adding cell therapy to the armamentarium for treatment of lung cancer. The TILs give the immune system a boost by providing more T cells to mount an attack, and the checkpoint inhibitor prevents the tumor from inactivating the T cells that infiltrate the tumor,  said Eric Haura, M.D., associate center director of Clinical Science at Moffitt.Twenty non-small cell lung cancer patients were enrolled in the pilot study. Each patient had one or more of their tumors removed. Those tumors were sent to the lab where each was dissected to remove the immune cells that had penetrated. These cells, called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, were then cultured and expanded to be reinfused into the patient.Before TIL therapy, each patient was treated with nivolumab. If the patient experienced disease progression after checkpoint inhibitory therapy, they were infused with their personalized TIL therapy followed by nivolumab maintenance therapy.The researchers were able to successfully expand TILs for 95% of patients, and 16 out of 20 patients received the TIL infusion because their disease progressed after initial nivolumab therapy. The treatment combination resulted in promising anti-tumor activity, with 11 out of 16 patients experiencing tumor regression. Two patients had complete tumor responses that were ongoing after 18 months, and two patients had either a partial response or maintained clinical remission.After treatment, the researchers performed additional studies and confirmed that the patients had T cells that were reactive to multiple different tumor specific proteins, including proteins with genetic mutations. Our data indicate that TIL can mediate effective tumor responses in subtypes that are not sensitive to traditional immune checkpoint targeted therapy. Therefore, we believe TIL may extend the scope and impact of immunotherapy into wider populations,  said Ben Creelan, M.D., associate member of the Department of Thoracic Oncology at Moffitt.A new study is being developed to improve the TIL production and expand testing in oncogene-driven lung cancer patients whose tumors progressed on targeted agents. Ongoing work from the current study is determining why some patients respond best and why some tumors progress despite initial responses from TIL. Reference: Creelan BC, Wang C, Teer JK, et al.

Scientists at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have identified the underlying issue and developed a method to keep cultured cells healthy. These findings, they say, are positive news for patients seeking stem cell transplants   and may hint at a new way to ward off aging.The findings will be published in the August 12, 2021 online issue of Cell Stem Cell. In bone marrow transplants, hematopoietic stem cells are infused intravenously to reestablish blood production in patients whose bone marrow or immune system is damaged. The procedure is used to treat diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia and immune deficiency disorders. However, donor stem cells are not always available for patients who need them. Even for patients who do receive stem cell therapies, transplanting more cells yields fewer complications and increases chances of overarching success,  said senior author Robert Signer, PhD, assistant professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine.While other researchers have tried to culture hematopoietic stem cells by recreating the bone marrow environment in a dish, Signer s team instead asked what internal mechanism makes the cells unhealthy to begin with, and could they remedy that process directly? Lead author Miriama Kruta, PhD, postdoc in Signer's lab at the time of the study, and colleagues found that in the foreign environment of the culture dish, stem cells begin producing excess proteins, causing extreme stress. The state of stress activates the heat shock response, a highly conserved stress reduction pathway regulated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). The researchers identified two different small molecules that super-activate the HSF1 gene. By adding these to the culture, the enhanced activity of the heat shock pathway helped rebalance the cells  state of equilibrium or homeostasis.  Now, we can preserve high-quality stem cells in culture over a prolonged period of time,  said Signer.  We hope the increased quality will lead to improved clinical outcomes.  The recovery of protein homeostasis by enhanced HSF1 activation was shown in both mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells. The next step, said Signer, is to test how these small molecules affect the outcome of human stem cells in transplantation systems.The researchers discovered the heat shock pathway isn t just important in a Petri dish, it also keeps stem cells healthy in their native bone marrow during aging. While HSF1 is inactive in the stem cells of young adults, it is turned on in middle-aged and older adults.  HSF1 is activated during aging to keep your stem cells fit,  said Signer.  Protein damage impairs stem cells during aging and likely contributes to disrupting blood and immune cell production in older people.  Signer said super-activating HSF1 might eventually be used to improve stem cell and tissue function in aging to prevent blood disorders and boost immunity in older adults.Reference: Kruta M, Sunshine MJ, Chua BA, et al.

CAR T-cell therapy is a promising new approach to treat cancer. It involves collecting a patient s T cells and genetically engineering them to express special receptors, called CAR, on their surface that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells. The resulting CAR T cells are then infused back into the patient to find and attack cells that have the cancer antigens on their surface.This therapy has worked well for the treatment of some blood cancers and lymphoma, but not against solid tumors. That s because many of the target antigens on these tumors are also expressed on normal tissues and organs. This can cause toxic side effects that can kills cells these effects are known as on-target, off-tumor toxicity. CAR T cells are so potent that they may also attack normal tissues that are expressing the target antigens at low levels,  said first author Yiqian (Shirley) Wu, a project scientist in Wang s lab. The problem with standard CAR T cells is that they are always on they are always expressing the CAR protein, so you cannot control their activation,  explained Wu.To combat this issue, the team took standard CAR T cells and re-engineered them so that they only express the CAR protein when ultrasound energy is applied. This allowed the researchers to choose where and when the genes of CAR T cells get switched on. We use ultrasound to successfully control CAR T cells directly in vivo for cancer immunotherapy,  said Wang, who is a faculty member of the Institute of Engineering in Medicine and the Center for Nano-ImmunoEngineering, both at UC San Diego. What s exciting about the use of ultrasound, noted Wang, is that it can penetrate tens of centimeters beneath the skin, so this type of therapy has the potential to non-invasively treat tumors that are buried deep inside the body.The team s approach involves injecting the re-engineered CAR T cells into tumors in mice and then placing a small ultrasound transducer on an area of the skin that s on top of the tumor to activate the CAR T cells. The transducer uses what s called focused ultrasound beams to focus or concentrate short pulses of ultrasound energy at the tumor. This causes the tumor to heat up moderately in this case, to a temperature of 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) without affecting the surrounding tissue. The CAR T cells in this study are equipped with a gene that produces the CAR protein only when exposed to heat. As a result, the CAR T cells only switch on where ultrasound is applied.The researchers put their CAR T cells to the test against standard CAR T cells. In mice that were treated with the new CAR T cells, only the tumors that were exposed to ultrasound were attacked, while other tissues in the body were left alone. But in mice that were treated with the standard CAR T cells, all tumors and tissue expressing the target antigen were attacked. This shows our CAR T-cell therapy is not only effective, but also safer,  said Wu.  It has minimal on-target, off-tumor side effects. The work is still in the early stages. The team will be performing more preclinical tests and toxicity studies before it can reach clinical trials.Reference: Wu Y, Liu Y, Huang Z. et al.

Previously, achieving delivery of ASO with adequate concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) with systemic dosing was difficult. Now, researchers from Japan and the USA have developed a drug delivery platform that overcomes this hurdle. Evolution has equipped the brain with protection against both mechanical and molecular injury. The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a selectively semipermeable barricade of endothelial cells lining the capillaries; working with specific transporter proteins, it functions as a fastidious gatekeeper between the circulation and the CNS, barring foreign molecules, including drugs.ASOs are pharmaceutical molecules that can target disease at the genetic level. They comprise a few dozen base pairs arranged in an  antisense  or reverse order and prevent production of pathogenic proteins through binding to the  sense  strand of mRNA targets. Single-stranded ASOs show great promise against CNS disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy. However, they do not enter the CNS effectively following systemic administration and require direct intrathecal injection. This may be hazardous particularly for patients with lumbar spinal deformity or on blood-thinners.The research team had recently developed DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) technology capable of highly efficient RNA degradation in vivo. First author Tetsuya Nagata explains,  We found that cholesterol conjugated HDO (Chol-HDO), unlike cholesterol-ASO, efficiently reached the CNS following subcutaneous or intravenous administration in experimental animals. The Chol-HDO platform showed significant dose-dependent target gene reductions with prolonged action in all CNS regions and cell types.  Further, the researchers confirmed that this beneficial outcome was not at the expense of vascular barrier integrity. They also investigated the pharmacokinetics of multiple injections as well as subcutaneous dosing (which may be self-administered). Additionally, the effects were confirmed across species and against other neurogenerative disease gene targets such as myotonic dystrophy type 1, Alexander disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Systemic doses being higher, adverse effects such as mild decrease in platelets were expected,  says Nagata.  However, divided or subcutaneous dosing can rescue these. We may also strategize by initiating treatment with intrathecal dosing to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations, followed by intravenous or subcutaneous maintenance as needed.   Our innovative therapeutic platform for blood-to-brain delivery of ASOs may revolutionize management of neurodegenerative diseases,  senior author Takanori Yokota claims.  Future research will help define the specific molecular pathways thus optimizing delivery of ASO pharmacotherapy to the CNS. Reference: Nagata T, Dwyer CA, Yoshida-Tanaka K, et al.

The findings were published today in Nature Nanotechnology. I ve always been interested in harnessing the intrinsic immunity to fight against cancer,  said Jianqin Lu, BPharm, PhD, assistant professor of pharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics in the UArizona College of Pharmacy s Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and associate member of the UArizona Cancer Center.  To do this in a safe and effective way, nanotechnology comes into play because of its ability to improve drug movement and therapeutic efficacy, as well as the potential to reduce systemic toxicities. My hope is that these innovative nanotherapeutics and therapeutic regimens eventually will help cancer patients combat cancers more effectively and safely. Immunotherapies help boost the immune system s ability to fight off cancer cells. Immune checkpoints are regulators of the immune system, which are pivotal in preventing the body from attacking healthy cells indiscriminately. Some types of cancer circumvent these checkpoints, allowing cancerous cells to avoid detection and continue to spread. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a newer therapy that can essentially ""release the brakes"" on the immune system and help the body fight back. ICB therapies are effective for some types of cancer, but they don t work for every patient. For example, only approximately 4% of patients with colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in U.S., will respond to ICB therapy, Dr. Lu said.Recent research has focused on ways to enhance the power of ICB therapies by combining them with chemotherapeutic agents such as camptothecin. Though camptothecin is potent, it is also unstable, has poor solubility in water and can have serious side effects for healthy cells.Dr. Lu and the research team created the first nanotherapeutic platform of its kind to overcome these hurdles. Using a nanotechnology delivery method, researchers enhanced camptothecin s ability to synergize with ICB therapies, making them more effective against aggressive tumors.  To render a more effective ICB therapy, we have developed a nanotherapeutic platform that can switch the tumors from  immune-cold  to  immune-hot,  said Dr. Lu, who is also a member of the BIO5 Institute and the Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center.  As a result, this nanotherapeutic platform was able to increase the effectiveness of the ICB therapy to eradicate a large portion of early-stage colorectal cancer tumors while concurrently activating the body s memory immunity, preventing tumor recurrence.   The team attached camptothecin to sphingomyelin, a naturally occuring lipid found on the surface of cells. The combination of the two molecules into a nanovesicle called camptothesome stabilized camptothecin, improving its efficacy and diminishing systemic toxicities. The nanotech delivery method also improved the tumor uptake of the camptothesome in a rodent model, where it deeply penetrated the tumour with efficient release of the chemotherapy.Dr. Lu and the research team then created a way to load an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting one of the key checkpoints, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), inside of the camptothesomes. When combined with inhibitors targeting other immune checkpoints known as PD-L1 and PD-1, this nanotherapeutic strategy eliminated a significant portion of clinically difficult-to-treat late-stage metastatic colorectal cancer and melanoma tumors, paving the pathway for further studies.   The researchers note that their nanotechnology platform can be used to deliver a range of cancer therapeutics, and it has a significant head start in the drug development pipeline as it is derived from sphingomyelin, a lipid that is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Dr. Lu hopes to collaborate with oncologists at the UArizona Cancer Center to further optimize the nanotherapeutic system to make it suitable for an early phase clinical trial.Reference: Wang Z, Little N, Chen J, et al.

By generating and studying isotopic data in the mammoth s tusk, they were able to match its movements and diet with isotopic maps of the region.Few details have been known about the lives and movements of woolly mammoths, and the study offers the first evidence that they traveled vast distances. An outline of the mammoth s life is detailed in the new issue of the journal Science. It s not clear-cut if it was a seasonal migrator, but it covered some serious ground,  said University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Matthew Wooller, senior and co-lead author of the paper.  It visited many parts of Alaska at some point during its lifetime, which is pretty amazing when you think about how big that area is. Researchers at the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility, where Wooller is director, split the 6-foot tusk lengthwise and generated about 400,000 microscopic data points using a laser and other techniques.The detailed isotope analyses they made are possible because of the way that mammoth tusks grew. Mammoths steadily added new layers on a daily basis throughout their lives. When the tusk was split lengthwise for sampling, these growth bands looked like stacked ice cream cones, offering a chronological record of an entire mammoth s life. From the moment they re born until the day they die, they ve got a diary and it s written in their tusks,  said Pat Druckenmiller, a paleontologist and director of the UA Museum of the North.  Mother Nature doesn t usually offer up such convenient and lifelong records of an individual s life. Scientists knew that the mammoth died on Alaska s North Slope above the Arctic Circle, where its remains were excavated by a team that included UAF s Dan Mann and Pam Groves, who are among the co-authors of the study.Researchers pieced together the mammoth s journey up to that point by analyzing isotopic signatures in its tusk from the elements strontium and oxygen, which were matched with maps predicting isotope variations across Alaska. Researchers created the maps by analyzing the teeth of hundreds of small rodents from across Alaska held in the museum s collections. The animals travel relatively small distances during their lifetimes and represent local isotope signals.Using that local dataset, they mapped isotope variation across Alaska, providing a baseline to trace the mammoth movements. After taking geographic barriers into account and the average distance it traveled each week, researchers used a novel spatial modeling approach to chart the likely routes the animal took during its life.Ancient DNA preserved in the mammoth s remains allowed the team to identify it as a male that was related to the last group of its species living in mainland Alaska. Those details provided more insight into the animal s life and behavior, said Beth Shapiro, who led the DNA component of the study.For example, an abrupt shift in its isotopic signature, ecology and movement at about age 15 probably coincided with the mammoth being kicked out of its herd, mirroring a pattern seen in some modern-day male elephants. Knowing that he was male provided a better biological context in which we could interpret the isotopic data,  said Shapiro, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.Isotopes also offered a clue about what led to the animal s demise. Nitrogen isotopes spiked during the final winter of its life, a signal that can be a hallmark of starvation in mammals. It s just amazing what we were able to see and do with this data,  said co-lead author Clement Bataille, a researcher from the University of Ottawa who led the modeling effort in collaboration with Amy Willis at the University of Washington.Discovering more about the lives of extinct species satisfies more than curiosity, said Wooller, a professor in the UAF Institute of Northern Engineering and College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Those details could be surprisingly relevant today as many species adapt their movement patterns and ranges with the shifting climate. The Arctic is seeing a lot of changes now, and we can use the past to see how the future may play out for species today and in the future,  Wooller said.  Trying to solve this detective story is an example of how our planet and ecosystems react in the face of environmental change. Reference: Wooller MJ, Bataille C, Druckenmiller P, et al.

The discovery could lead to new methods for classifying and treating patients with this disease.The researchers, who published their findings August 11 in Cell, found that in a number of lupus patients, maturing red blood cells fail to get rid of their mitochondria tiny molecular reactors that help convert oxygen into chemical energy in most cell types, but are normally excluded from red blood cells. This abnormal retention of mitochondria can trigger the cascade of inappropriate and harmful immune activity that is characteristic of the disease.  Our findings support that red blood cells can play a really important role in driving inflammation in a subgroup of lupus patients,  said senior author Dr. Virginia Pascual, the Drukier Director of the Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children s Health and the Ronay Menschel Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine.  So this adds a new piece to the lupus puzzle, and could now open the door to new possibilities for therapeutic interventions.  The lead author of the study was Dr. Simone Caielli, assistant professor of immunology research at the Drukier Institute and the Department of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine. Lupus, also known as systemic lupus erythematosus, is a chronic disorder that features intermittent and sometimes debilitating attacks by the immune system on the body s own healthy tissues, including skin, joints, hair follicles, heart and kidneys. A common underlying factor is the abnormally elevated production of immune-activating proteins called type I interferons. Treatments, which often are taken long-term and have side effects, aim to suppress immune activity, including interferon-driven inflammation. There is no cure for lupus, and how it arises is still largely mysterious. It is estimated to affect roughly 200,000 people in the United States, the vast majority of whom are female. Previous studies have shown defective mitochondria within immune cells of lupus patients. In the new study, the researchers examined red blood cells, which are supposed to have no mitochondria at all. They found that a large number of lupus patients had red blood cells with detectable levels of mitochondria and these cells were especially frequent in patients with the most severe lupus symptoms. By contrast, healthy controls had no mitochondria-containing red blood cells. Dr. Caielli then studied how human red blood cells normally rid themselves of mitochondria as they mature, as prior studies had mainly examined this in mice, and why this process could be defective in lupus patients. Further experiments revealed how these abnormal red blood cells cause inflammation. In general, as red blood cells age or display signs of damage they are removed by scavenger immune cells called macrophages. Antibodies that bind red blood cells also facilitate their removal. Once ingested by macrophages, the red blood cells  mitochondrial DNA stimulates a powerful inflammatory pathway called the cGAS/STING pathway, which in turn drives type I interferon production.  Underlining the relevance of these findings,  those lupus patients with mitochondria-containing red blood cells and evidence of circulating anti-RBC antibodies had higher interferon signatures compared to those who didn t,  Dr. Caielli said. The researchers are now continuing to study the complex process by which mitochondria are retained in red blood cells and end up driving abnormal immune activation. Identifying patients whose lupus symptoms are driven this way might permit to detect when they are likely to undergo lupus flares and to identify specific therapies for them.ReferenceCaielli S et al.

According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, 710 million tons of global carbon dioxide came from commercial aviation in 2013. By 2017, that number reached 860 million tons, a 21% increase in four years. By 2018, it climbed to 905 million tons, 2.4% of total CO2 emissions.Airplane manufacturers and their customers in government and industry have invested in the design of new aircraft engines that function at extremely high temperatures, which means the engines can generate more energy while burning less fuel. However, the very high temperatures can be a problem for the materials used to make the engine.Haydn Wadley, Edgar Starke Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Jeroen Deijkers, a postdoctoral research associate in Wadley s group, found a way to greatly extend the life of the materials used in these jet engines. Their paper,  A Duplex Bond Coat Approach to Environmental Barrier Coating Systems,  is published in the September 2021 issue of Acta Materialia. A jet engine gulps huge quantities of air, which, when compressed and mixed with hydrocarbon fuel and burned in a combustor, powers the plane s propulsion system. The hotter the combustor, the more efficient the engine,  Wadley said.Combustion in airplane engines now reaches or exceeds 1500 degrees centigrade, well above the melting temperatures of engine parts typically made of nickel and cobalt alloys. Research has turned to ceramics that can withstand these temperatures, but they must contend with chemical reactions from the water vapor and unburnt oxygen in the extreme combustion environment.Silicon carbide is the ceramic of choice. However, engine parts made of silicon carbide would last only a few thousand hours of flight time. At such high temperatures, the carbon element reacts with oxygen to form carbon monoxide (a gas), while the silicon forms silica (a solid), but silica reacts with water vapor to form a gaseous silicon hydroxide. In other words, the engine part progressively turns into gas and disappears out the tail pipe.To protect the ceramic parts, engine manufacturers apply a two-layer coating, called an environmental barrier coating system, to the silicon carbide. The outer layer is designed to slow the spread of oxygen and water vapor toward the silicon carbide during flight, while an inner bond coat made of silicon protects the silicon carbide s surface by reacting with the oxygen to form a thin layer of silica. But there are still challenges to this design. The life of the engine component is often dictated by the time it takes for the silica layer thickness to reach a critical point where the stress caused by expansion and contraction during repeated heating and cooling causes the coating to pop off,  Wadley said.Scientists and engineers have two basic strategies to delay the coating s separation and extend the life of expensive engine components. They can make the outer coating layer very thick to slow down the arrival of oxygen at the bond coat, but that adds weight and cost. Or, they can create a different kind of protective oxide, one that does not  pop off. Deijkers and Wadley pursued the second strategy.Their solution uses an outer layer of ytterbium disilicate, a rare earth element that shares silicon s and silicon carbide s thermal expansion characteristics and is slow to transport oxygen and water vapor toward the silicon layer. They first deposited the silicon bond coat and then placed a thin layer of hafnium oxide between the silicon and the ytterbium disilicate outer layer.Their experimental studies show that as the silica forms on the silicon, it immediately reacts with the hafnia to form a silicon-hafnium oxide, or hafnon. The hafnon s thermal expansion and contraction is the same as the rest of the coating and will never cause the coating to pop off or crack. Wadley calls it adding a little  hafnia fairy dust. When we deposit a very thin layer of hafnia on top of silicon, followed by a layer of ytterbium disilicate, the oxygen that passes through the ytterbium disilicate creates a chemical reaction with the underlying materials to form the hafnon,  Deijkers said.Deijkers  access to unique equipment in Wadley s lab, specifically a directed vapor deposition system, enabled this breakthrough in environmental barrier coatings. The ability to deposit a film of ytterbium disilicate that is thinner than the diameter of a human hair is key to their success.The directed vapor deposition process uses a powerful 10-kilowatt focused electron beam to melt material in a low-pressure chamber. A supersonic gas jet transports the vapor to the silicon-coated silicon carbide where it condenses, creating a thin film. They then use a plasma spray method to deposit the final ytterbium disilicate layer, and the coated component is then ready for testing.Deijkers successfully defended his dissertation in October 2020, combining his interests in aircraft and high-temperature materials for his Ph.D. research, and following his father s path into materials science and engineering. My dad used to work on dredging ships. Seeing the pump house glowing orange-white in the furnace, that s how I caught the engineering bug,  Deijkers said.Deijkers, who is from the Netherlands, combined these early memories with his interest in serving in the Dutch Air Force, earning a bachelor s and master s degree in aerospace engineering from Delft University of Technology.When Deijkers began applying to Ph.D. programs in the United States, his master s thesis on thermal barrier coatings captured Wadley s attention. Deijkers  arrival was well timed. Group member Brad Richards, who earned his Ph.D. in materials science and engineering from UVA in 2015, had developed the silicon-ytterbium disilicate coating system for ceramics that was subsequently found to be very similar to that being used by the makers of aircraft engines.Deijkers  dissertation improves Richards  coating system, deepening understanding of the surface chemistry involved and increasing the coating system s viability for commercial adoption. One set of questions driving my research focused on how long it takes for the hafnon to form through the oxidation process,  Deijkers said.  I wanted to understand how this process really works, and whether we could actually put it to use. This coating has greater potential than we thought; we need to develop it and put it in an actual engine, to move it further along the path toward commercialization. Today s methods are rooted in deposition techniques developed in the 1970s. Compared to the state-of-the-art in industry, our research makes a major improvement,  Deijkers said.  My rough estimate, if industrial manufacturers were able to implement these newer processing techniques, they could extend the engine parts  lifetime by as much as 200 times. But there are a lot of hurdles to jump through to get that level of performance. Wadley s research group made these advancements with the support of the Office of Naval Research, which awarded Wadley s team two successive grants over a period of six years. The problems we have to solve are multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional,  Wadley said.  We need to fuse together knowledge from mechanics, chemistry and materials science in order to make progress. Beyond the immediate need to reduce CO2 emitted by propulsion technology, our research supports the global shift from carbon-containing hydrocarbons to hydrogen fuels and the eventual electrification of air travel platforms. Whereas Deijkers hopes to attract private industry to the team s coatings system and deposition process, his career ambition is to pursue scientific discoveries at a national laboratory or in academia. The nation has an urgent need for talent in this arena,  Wadley said.  We are in desperate need for bright, creative people who want to be trained to solve these kinds of problems for society going forward. Just as Deijkers continued Richards  research, he encourages UVA Engineering undergraduates to participate in the interdisciplinary research underway in Wadley s group. We had undergraduates from aerospace engineering, physics, systems engineering,  Deijkers said.  We are working a lot of different aspects of the problem   computer modeling, materials synthesis, thermo-mechanical life design. We always have things for undergraduates to do, and we re always open for them to do research with us. Reference: Deijkers JA, Wadley HNG.

But Cornell and Stanford University researchers believe it may harm the climate more than burning fossil fuel.The carbon footprint to create blue hydrogen is more than 20% greater than using either natural gas or coal directly for heat, or about 60% greater than using diesel oil for heat, according to new research published Aug. 12 in Energy Science & Engineering.  Most of the hydrogen in the U.S. and Europe comes from natural gas, using steam and pressure to convert the methane from natural gas into a so-called  gray  hydrogen and carbon dioxide,  said Robert Howarth, the David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Howarth, together with Mark Z. Jacobson, Stanford professor of civil and environmental engineering, authored  How Green is Blue Hydrogen?.  Blue hydrogen starts with converting methane to hydrogen and carbon dioxide by using heat, steam and pressure, or gray hydrogen, but goes further to capture some of the carbon dioxide. Once the byproduct carbon dioxide and the other impurities are sequestered, it becomes blue hydrogen, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The process to make blue hydrogen takes a large amount of energy, according to the researchers, which is generally provided by burning more natural gas.  In the past, no effort was made to capture the carbon dioxide byproduct of gray hydrogen, and the greenhouse gas emissions have been huge,  Howarth said.  Now the industry promotes blue hydrogen as a solution, an approach that still uses the methane from natural gas, while attempting to capture the byproduct carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, emissions remain very large.  Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, Howarth said. It is more than 100 times stronger as an atmospheric warming agent than carbon dioxide when first emitted. The United Nations  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released on August 9 shows that cumulatively to date over the past century, methane has contributed about two-thirds as much to global warming as carbon dioxide has, he said. Considering both the uncaptured carbon dioxide and the large emissions of unburned, so-called  fugitive  methane emissions inherent in using natural gas, the carbon footprint to create blue hydrogen is more than 20% greater than burning either natural gas or coal directly for heat, or about 60% greater than using diesel oil for heat, according to the new paper. Emissions of blue hydrogen are less than for gray hydrogen, but not greatly so: perhaps surprisingly, only by about 9% to 12%.  Blue hydrogen is hardly emissions free,  wrote the researchers.  Blue hydrogen as a strategy only works to the extent it is possible to store carbon dioxide long-term indefinitely into the future without leakage back to the atmosphere.  An ecologically friendly  green  hydrogen does exist, but it remains a small sector and it has not been commercially realized. Green hydrogen is achieved when water goes through electrolysis (with electricity supplied by solar, wind or hydroelectric power) and the water is separated into hydrogen and oxygen. On Aug. 10, the U.S. Senate passed its version of the $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which includes several billion dollars to develop, subsidize and strengthen hydrogen technology and its industry.  Political forces may not have caught up with the science yet,  Howarth said.  Even progressive politicians may not understand for what they re voting. Blue hydrogen sounds good, sounds modern and sounds like a path to our energy future. It is not.  Said Howarth:  The best hydrogen, the green hydrogen derived from electrolysis   if used wisely and efficiently   can be that path to a sustainable future. Blue hydrogen is totally different.

Interferons play a major role in activating the body s response to viral threats, but they have also been detected in the lesions of many psoriasis patients at abnormal levels. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes overproduction of skin cells and impacts nearly 30 million people in the world.Using a model that mimics psoriasis in mice, researchers found that changing the levels of interferon kappa, a protein made by skin cells, altered the severity of inflammation and production of cell signaling molecules, called cytokines, that induce inflammation characteristic of psoriasis. Investigators found more psoriasis-like inflammation when more interferon kappa was present, while decreasing interferon kappa levels reduced disease.The findings, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, suggest using therapies to modulate interferon states may limit inflammation in psoriasis patients. We ve known that psoriatic inflammation is marked by interferon-related gene expression, but how interferons alter the severity of the disease has not been clear,  said J. Michelle Kahlenberg, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of rheumatology at Michigan Medicine and senior author of the paper.  Understanding how interferon kappa may modulate psoriasis brings us one step closer to optimizing our treatments. The research team induced psoriasis in mouse models, splitting them into groups with interferon kappa at low, normal or elevated levels. The overexpressed protein alone didn t induce the disease, but it primed the skin for the inflammatory response that followed.   This work shows how the context of the skin environment can shape inflammatory responses.  said Mehrnaz Gharaee-Kermani, DVM, M.P.H., Ph.D., lead author of the study and a senior research lab specialist at Michigan Medicine.  It will be exciting to see how this can be applied in clinic. The research team is conducting further studies to understand the role of interferon kappa in psoriasis patients through their Taubman Institute-sponsored study at Michigan Medicine and in partnership with Johann E. Gudhonsson, M.D., Ph.D., receiving funding through the National Psoriasis Foundation. Several treatments are used against the disease, but there is no cure.A few current psoriasis drugs inhibit interferons, but many that are more specific are still in the trial phase. Coupled with the study s findings, personalized medicine will be paramount as physicians attempt to treat this disease, Kahlenberg said. Until now, treatments have been tested by studying a drug in hundreds of patients, lumping the average of them all together and targeting the average of those patients,  Kahlenberg said.  As any patient who has been on these medications will tell you, this trial and-error approach wastes patient time and money trying to get control of the disease. Understanding a patient s background level of interferon might help us target things within that person to make their disease better faster and stay in remission.

The technology they ve developed, using robotics and AI to identify grape plants infected with a devastating fungus, will soon be available to researchers nationwide working on a wide array of plant and animal research.The biologist, Lance Cadle-Davidson, Ph.D.  03, an adjunct professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science (SIPS), is working to develop grape varieties that are more resistant to powdery mildew, but his lab s research was bottlenecked by the need to manually assess thousands of grape leaf samples for evidence of infection. Powdery mildew, a fungus that attacks many plants including wine and table grapes, leaves sickly white spores across leaves and fruit and costs grape growers worldwide billions of dollars annually in lost fruit and fungicide costs. Cadle-Davidson is also a research plant pathologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS). He works in the Grape Genetics Research Unit in Geneva, New York, and his team developed prototypes of imaging robots that could scan grape leaf samples automatically   a process called high-throughput phenotyping   through the USDA-ARS funded VitisGen2 grape breeding project and in partnership with the Light and Health Research Center. This partnership led to the creation of a robotic camera they named  BlackBird.  But extracting relevant biological information from these images was still a critical need. Enter the engineer and computer scientist: Yu Jiang, an assistant research professor in SIPS  Horticulture Section at Cornell AgriTech. Jiang s research focuses on systems engineering, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The BlackBird robot can gather information at a scale of 1.2 micrometers per pixel   equivalent to a regular optical microscope. For each 1-centimeter leaf sample being examined, the robot provides 8,000 by 5,000 pixels of information. Extracting useful information from such a large, high-resolution image was Jiang s challenge, and his team used AI to solve it. Using breakthroughs in deep neural networks developed for computer vision tasks like face recognition, Jiang applied this knowledge to the analysis of microscopic images of grape leaves. In addition, Jiang and his team implemented the visualization of the network inferential processes, which help biologists better understand the analysis process and build confidence with AI models. Working together, Cadle-Davidson s team tests and validates what the robots see, enabling Jiang s team to teach them how to identify biological traits more effectively. The results are astounding, Cadle-Davison said. Research experiments that used to take his entire lab team six months to complete now take the BlackBird robots just one day.  It has revolutionized our science,  Cadle-Davidson said.  And we re finding that Yu s AI tools actually do a better job of explaining the genetics of these grapes than we can do sitting at a microscope for months at a time doing backbreaking work.  In the month of July alone, the collaboration won an award and two new grants. On July 1, the team was awarded a $100,000 grant from the USDA-ARS to disseminate BlackBird to ARS field offices working on other crops that do the same kind of high-throughput phenotyping work.  We hope to find collaborative labs who can join us in taking advantage of this tool,  Jiang said.  We see potential applications for this research in plant studies, animal fields or medical purposes.  On July 12, the team s article on their project won the Information Technology, Sensors, and Control Systems  best paper award at the 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers annual international meeting. And on July 27, they were awarded a two-year, $150,000 grant from the Cornell Institute for Digital Agriculture Research Innovation Fund to begin upgrading the BlackBird robot to see beyond the red-green-blue color spectrum and into infrared. Plant diseases like powdery mildew can show up in infrared before they are visible to the naked eye; if the researchers can develop tools to help farmers detect disease early, it would enable farmers to target fungicide sprays before infection spreads, meaning less fungicide and fewer lost crops. They re also working to integrate AI more effectively with scientists in data analysis.  This work is greatly accelerating the pace of breeding and genetics work in grape,  said Donnell Brown, president of National Grape Research Alliance.  Normally, when we in industry invest in research, we do it knowing that we may never see the outcome of our investments in our lifetimes   it s really a faith-based investment in future generations of growers. But now, this technology is really shortening that timeline, for the benefit of growers and consumers.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

But a new study suggests your metabolism, the rate at which you burn calories, actually peaks much earlier and starts its inevitable decline later than you might think.The findings appear in the journal Science. As we age, there are a lot of physiological changes that occur in the phases of our life such as during puberty and in menopause.  What s odd is that the timing of our  metabolic life stages  doesn t appear to match the markers we associate with growing up and getting older,  said study co-author Jennifer Rood, PhD, Associate Executive Director for Cores and Resources at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.Four Pennington Biomedical researchers were part of an international team of scientists who analyzed the average calories burned by more than 6,600 people as they went about their daily lives.  The participants  ages ranged from one week old to 95 years, and they lived in 29 different countries.  The other Pennington Biomedical scientists are Peter Katzmarzyk, PhD, Associate Executive Director for Population and Public Health Sciences; Corby Martin, PhD, Professor and Director, Ingestive Behavior Laboratory; and Eric Ravussin, PhD, Associate Executive Director for Clinical Science.Most previous large-scale studies measured how much energy the body uses for basic vital functions   breathing, digesting, and pumping blood   the calories you need just to stay alive. But basic functions account for just 50 percent to 70 percent of the calories we burn each day. They don t include the energy we spend doing everything else: washing the dishes, walking the dog, breaking a sweat at the gym, even just thinking or fidgeting.To come up with a number for total daily energy expenditure, the researchers turned to the  doubly labeled water  method. It s a urine test that involves having a person drink water in which the hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecules have been replaced with naturally occurring  heavy  forms, and then measures how quickly they re flushed out.Scientists have used the technique   considered the gold standard for measuring daily energy expenditure during normal daily life outside of the lab   to measure energy expenditure in humans since the 1980s. But previous studies were limited in size and scope due to cost. To get around that limitation, multiple labs shared their data in a single database, to see if they could tease out truths hidden or only hinted at in previous studies.Pooling and analyzing energy expenditures across the entire lifespan revealed some surprises. Some people think of their teens and 20s as the age when their calorie-burning potential hits its peak,  Dr. Katzmarzyk said.   But the study shows that, pound for pound, infants had the highest metabolic rates of all. Energy needs shoot up during the first 12 months of life.  By their first birthdays, babies burn calories 50 percent faster for their body size than adults.And that s not just because infants are busy tripling their birth weight in their first year. The babies grow rapidly, which accounts for much of the effect.  However, after you control for this, their energy expenditures tend to be higher than what you would expect for their body size,  Dr. Martin said.An infant s explosive metabolism may help explain why children who don t get enough to eat during this developmental stage are less likely to survive and grow up to be healthy adults. More research is needed to better understand the metabolism of babies. We need to know what is driving higher energy expenditures,  Dr. Martin said.After the initial surge in infancy, a person s metabolism slows by about 3 percent each year until our 20s, when it levels off into a new normal.Surprisingly, the growth spurts of adolescence didn t generate an increase in daily calorie needs after researchers took body size into account.  Another surprise?  People s metabolisms were most stable from their 20s through their 50s.  Calorie needs during pregnancy grew no more than expected.The findings suggest that other factors lie behind the so-called  middle-age spread. The data suggest that our metabolisms don t really start to decline again until after age 60. The slowdown is gradual, only 0.7 percent a year. But a person in their 90s needs 26 percent fewer calories each day than someone in midlife.Lost muscle mass as we get older may be partly to blame, the researchers say, since muscle burns more calories than fat. But it s not the whole picture. We took dwindling muscle mass into account.  After 60, a person s cells slow down,  Dr. Ravussin said.The patterns held even when differing activity levels were taken into account.Aging goes hand in hand with so many other physiological changes that it has been difficult to parse what drives the shifts in energy expenditure. But the new research supports the idea that it s more than age-related changes in lifestyle or body composition. This study shows that the work cells do changes over the course of the lifespan in ways we couldn t fully appreciate before.  But massive data sets like the one we collaborated on allow us to answer questions we couldn t address,  Dr. Ravussin said.Reference: Pontzer H, Yamada Y, Sagayama H, et al.

When highly active, this enzyme breaks down not just the pathogen   its job   but also degrades pieces of cells that participate in the immune response.Research in mice showed that an experimental COVID-19 vaccine containing a compound to inhibit the enzyme stimulated a robust antibody response that included immunity in the nose and mouth, ultimately providing extra protection for airways and the gastrointestinal tract. Our approach is to improve  border control.  The benefits are broad because in addition to providing protection in the bloodstream like most vaccines do, we also have excellent protection in the doors and windows of the body that communicate with the outside,  said senior study author Prosper Boyaka, professor and chair of the Department of Veterinary Biosciences at The Ohio State University. If we protect the mucosal area where the pathogen enters, then even if you don t reach total immunity there, you limit the amount of pathogen that enters the body so the antibodies inside are more efficient at clearing the infection. The experimental vaccine was produced by packaging a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) spike protein as an antigen with the common vaccine ingredient aluminum salts and an enzyme inhibitor. The findings suggest this affordable design could be particularly helpful in developing countries, where cold storage needed for existing vaccines is a challenge, said Boyaka, also an investigator and program director in Ohio State s Infectious Diseases Institute.The study was published online Aug. 5 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.There is an irony to the use of aluminum salts (also known as alum) in about 70% of the world s vaccines: While alum s presence actually enhances the immune response, it also recruits the white blood cells that secrete the enzyme, called elastase.Alum is inexpensive to obtain or produce and can be stored at room temperature, and is effective at promoting development of a bloodstream-based antibody response to vaccination. But it doesn t do much for cell-mediated immunity that improves protection against viruses and bacteria that use cells to reproduce, and can t generate a useful number of antibodies in the body s portals of entry for most pathogens: the nose, mouth and genitourinary tract.The researchers found that suppressing elastase in a vaccine containing alum had the dual benefits of broadening and speeding up the antibody response in the bloodstream and triggering the specific types of antibodies needed for immune protection of mucous membranes. We found a way to have the cells come and help the immune response to develop and the enzyme to break down the pathogen, but we don t want that response to be so high that it goes out of control. So we re just putting a brake on the activity those enzymes would have,  Boyaka said.  And we found if you apply that strategy, you can induce a response in the airways even if the vaccine is not given through the airway. The experimental vaccine enhanced the magnitude of mouse antibodies, which reacted to the same section of the spike protein in the vaccine that antibodies in plasma from COVID-19 patients attach to, as well as generating antibodies in mucosal areas. Immunized mice lacking the gene for the enzyme developed high-affinity antibodies as well.To further test the concept, the researchers found the enzyme-suppressing compound used in the study triggered production of specialized inflammation-regulating cells in cultures of human immune cells and pig spleen cells, showing that this strategy could improve vaccine immune responses in other species   including people.Boyaka s team envisions that a future injected vaccine containing an elastase inhibitor could expand SARS-CoV-2 vaccination availability across the world and even be used to boost existing vaccines. COVID will stay with us for some time, unfortunately, with the new variants,  he said.  What we need to do is have a portfolio of options that we could use depending on the health environment. Reprogramming the immune response induced by an injected vaccine containing alum is a way to make the vaccine more efficient for what we need. This could be a cheap and simple approach that can benefit people in developing countries. Reference: Kim E, Attia Z, Woodfint RM, et al.

Apes seem to do something similar, researchers report in a study publishing August 11 in the journal iScience, in which they documented apes purposefully using signals to start and then end interactions a behavior not seen outside of the human species until now. They also found that the social and power dynamics between the interacting apes affected the communication efforts used, which the researchers say mirrors patterns similar to human politeness. We were able to launch rockets and land on the moon because we have the ability to share our intentions, which allows us to achieve things so much bigger than a single individual can achieve alone. This ability has been suggested to be at the heart of human nature,  says Raphaela Heesen, a postdoctoral researcher at Durham University in the United Kingdom. Sharing intentions and working together on a common goal leads to a mutual sense of obligation otherwise known as joint commitment and now, she and her team are seeing evidence in great apes that might challenge the long-held claim that joint commitment is unique to humans.In previous experiments of joint commitment, human children protested when an experimenter abruptly stopped playing with them. Offering toys or vocalizing, the children tried to re-engage the experimenter in their previously agreed-upon play. After witnessing a similar situation between two bonobos who were interrupted while grooming but then used gestures to resume the interaction with each other Heesen and colleagues became curious to learn more about how and when joint commitment first emerged in the human lineage.But unlike previous scientists, Heesen and her team proposed that joint commitment isn t solely based on the feeling of obligation between two participants to fulfill a shared promise. Instead, it also involves the process of setting up the agreement and mutually deciding afterward that the agreement has been fulfilled.That means something as simple as entering a conversational commitment with eye contact and a  hello  and then signaling that a conversation is wrapping up with repeating  okay, sounds good  or a  goodbye  could be an example of this process. So Heesen and her colleagues set out to see if great apes had a similar interaction entry and exit process, which she and her team argued would demonstrate the process of joint commitment.After analyzing 1,242 interactions within groups of bonobos and chimpanzees in zoos, they found that the apes did in fact frequently gaze at and communicate with each other to start and end interactions. Bonobos exchanged entry signals and mutual gaze prior to playing 90% of the time and chimps 69% of the time. Exit phases were even more common, with 92% of bonobo and 86% of chimpanzee interactions involving exits. The signals included gestures like touching each other, holding hands or butting heads, or gazing at each other, before and after encounters like grooming or play.The researchers also considered factors like how close the apes were to each other socially or who had more power over the other. Interestingly, the closer bonobos were to each other, the shorter the duration of their entry and exit phases, if they existed after at all. The authors say this pattern is similar to how we, as humans, communicate with others, too.  When you re interacting with a good friend, you re less likely to put in a lot of effort in communicating politely,  Heesen says.However, the level of friendship and strength of social bonds didn t seem to affect the chimpanzees  entries and exits at all. This could be because in comparison to chimps  despotic power hierarchies, bonobo societies in general are documented to be more egalitarian, with emphasis on friendships and alliances between females and close mother-son relationships.As for understanding the origin and evolution of joint commitment, this study is another step forward but Heesen says there s a still a lot to do.  Behavior doesn t fossilize. You can t dig up bones to look at how behavior has evolved. But you can study our closest living relatives: great apes like chimpanzees and bonobos,  says Heesen.  Whether this type of communication is present in other species will also be interesting to study in the future. Reference: Heesen R, Bangerter A, Zuberb hler K, et al.

One key question for DNA researchers has been what role the helical nature of DNA plays in processes that take place on DNA.As a motor protein moves forward along DNA, it must twist or rotate the DNA, and therefore work against the torsional resistance of the DNA. (These motors can carry out gene expression or DNA replication as they move along DNA.) If a motor protein encounters too much resistance, it may stall. While scientists know that DNA torsional stiffness plays a crucial role in the fundamental processes of DNA, measuring torsional stiffness experimentally has been exceedingly difficult.In  Torsional Stiffness of Extended and Plectonemic DNA,  published July 7 in Physical Review Letters, researchers report on a new way to measure DNA torsional stiffness by measuring how hard it is to twist the DNA when the DNA end-to-end distance is held constant. We figured out a very clever trick to measure the torsional stiffness of DNA,  said senior author Michelle Wang, the James Gilbert White Distinguished Professor in the Physical Sciences in the Department of Physics in the College of Arts and Sciences and investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Intuitively, it seems that DNA will become extremely easy to twist under an extremely low force,  Wang said.  In fact, many people have made this assumption. We found that this is not the case, both experimentally and theoretically. The first author is Xiang Gao, postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics.The technique also offers new opportunities to study twist-induced phase transitions in DNA and their biological implications.  Many colleagues commented to me that they were really excited about this finding as it has broad implications for DNA processes in vivo,  Wang said.Reference: Gao X, Hong Y, Ye F, Inman JT, Wang MD.

Researchers in recent years discovered that populations of hippocampal neurons fire within milliseconds of each other in cycles. The firing pattern is called a  sharp wave ripple  for the shape it takes when captured graphically by EEG, a technology that records brain activity with electrodes.Published online in Nature on August 11, the new study found that clusters of hippocampal sharp wave ripples were reliably followed within minutes by decreases in blood sugar levels in the bodies of rats. While the details need to be confirmed, the findings suggest that the ripples may regulate the timing of the release of hormones, possibly including insulin, by the pancreas and liver, as well of other hormones by the pituitary gland. Our study is the first to show how clusters of brain cell firing in the hippocampus may directly regulate metabolism,  says senior study author Gy rgy Buzs ki, MD, PhD, the Biggs Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Neuroscience and Physiology at NYU Langone Health. We are not saying that the hippocampus is the only player in this process, but that the brain may have a say in it through sharp wave ripples,  says Dr. Buzs ki, also a faculty member in the Neuroscience Institute at NYU Langone.Known to keep blood sugar at normal levels, insulin is released by pancreatic cells, not continually, but periodically in bursts. As sharp wave ripples mostly occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the impact of sleep disturbance on sharp wave ripples may provide a mechanistic link between poor sleep and high blood sugar levels seen in type 2 diabetes, say the study authors.Previous work by Dr. Buzs ki s team had suggested that the sharp wave ripples are involved in permanently storing each day s memories the same night during NREM sleep, and his 2019 study found that rats learned faster to navigate a maze when ripples were experimentally prolonged. Evidence suggests that the brain evolved, for reasons of efficiency, to use the same signals to achieve two very different functions in terms of memory and hormonal regulation,  says corresponding study author David Tingley, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Dr. Buzs ki s lab.

Alan Wagner, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at Penn State, and Sarah Rajtmajer, assistant professor of information sciences and technology, recently received a $900,000 grant from the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research to investigate next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) skills and perhaps make Steve a little smarter. The suggestion that people create abstract mental representations to plan for future events and solve multi-step tasks is identified in the literature as the Construal Level Theory, according to Wagner. People think about future events, consciously or unconsciously, using memories and experiences to generate a plan for a future situation. Wagner and Rajtmajer plan to create AI agents that can mirror the human ability to plan for future events, and then use the video game Minecraft as a tool to test the new software. We will create an app that will be able to direct agents to complete certain complex tasks, and then integrate that app into Minecraft to run tests on the software,  Wagner said.  The agent that we create, in this case a Minecraft avatar, will be able to think in abstractions, or in the past, present and future, to solve problems. Minecraft, owned by Microsoft and released in 2011, regularly hosts  challenges,  where AI creators compete to solve a problem on the game, such as mining a diamond. That challenge is one scenario Wagner and Rajtmajer will test with the new AI software.To create the software, Wagner s former graduate student, Ali Ayub, developed a clustering technique for creating different levels of AI abstract thinking. He named the technique centrally based concept learning, or CBCL.  The hope is to use CBCL as a tool to allow us to create these abstractions and use them in a variety of ways in the game,  Wagner said.  Minecraft has different types of wood, rocks or animals, for example, and you can tie them into the AI planning process and allow the agent to pick the thing it needs to solve a particular problem. If they are successful, according to Wagner, the AI software could contribute to advances in robotics, logistics management, solving problems for pilots in the air, building structures in space and transforming drone flight.  I think this research has the opportunity to address a longstanding and fundamental challenge in agent-based modeling and behavioral game theory,  Rajtmajer said.  Current models of human social behavior are too simple and homogeneous to be applied to real-world behaviors. This work takes an important step toward representing elements of reasoning and social planning in AI. This article has been republished from the following materials.

As the building blocks of all cells including neurons, proteins hold the keys to better understanding complex brain diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s, which can lead to the development of new treatments.The study will be published on Aug. 11 in the journal Nature Communications.In the new study, researchers designed a virus to send an enzyme to a precise location in the brain of a living mouse. Derived from soybeans, the enzyme genetically tags its neighboring proteins in a predetermined location. After validating the technique by imaging the brain with fluorescence and electron microscopy, the researchers found their technique took a snapshot of the entire set of proteins (or proteome) inside living neurons, which can then be analyzed postmortem with mass spectroscopy. Similar work has been done before in cellular cultures. But cells in a dish do not work the same way they do in a brain, and they don t have the same proteins in the same places doing the same things,  said Northwestern s Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy, senior author of the study.  It s a lot more challenging to do this work in the complex tissue of a mouse brain. Now we can take that proteomics prowess and put it into more realistic neural circuits with excellent genetic traction. By chemically tagging proteins and their neighbors, researchers can now see how proteins work within a specific, controlled area and how they work with one another in a proteome. Along with the virus carrying the soybean enzyme, the researchers also used their virus to carry a separate green fluorescent protein. The virus essentially acts as a message that we deliver,  Kozorovitskiy said.  In this case, the message carried this special soybean enzyme. Then, in a separate message, we sent the green fluorescent protein to show us which neurons were tagged. If the neurons are green, then we know the soybean enzyme was expressed in those neurons. Kozorovitskiy is the Soretta and Henry Shapiro Research Professor of Molecular Biology, an associate professor of neurobiology in Northwestern s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciencesand a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute.

From a neuroscience point of view, it also means that MRI based studies of brain function are generally only ever studied in these vulnerable populations during an artificial induced sleep state so may not be representative of how the brain works in normal circumstances.Lead researcher Dr Kun Qian from the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King s College London said having an MRI scan can be quite an alien experience as it involves going into a narrow tunnel, with loud and often strange noises in the background, all while having to stay as still as possible. We were keen to find other ways of enabling children and vulnerable people to have an MRI scan,  Dr Qian said. Our interest in VR specifically came from the simple observation that when someone is using and then immersed in a VR environment, they are entirely unaware of their surroundings. We thought if we could make a system compatible with the MRI environment, it could be a very powerful alternative way to successfully scan these challenging populations. To provide patients with an immersive VR environment, the researchers developed a special VR headset that can be safely used inside MRI scanner.The headset is designed to be light tight, so that the user cannot see their surrounding environment at all and is unaware of visual reminders of their position.Once the system is properly positioned, the system s projector is immediately live, providing immersive content and the VR experience is then continuous from that point onwards until the patient is removed at the end of the examination.The researchers say this and other measures are highly effective at removing the sense of being inside the MRI scanner, as their visual scene is completely replaced with the VR environment and through creating congruence with the other sensations that are perceived during MRI examinations such as scanner noise, table movement and table vibration.So far, this has been done by including elements in the visual scene that indicate that construction work is in progress in the virtual world, which could account for scanner noise and vibration.One of the main novelties with this system is that the users can interact with the virtual world just with eye gaze   how we do things in our day-to-day lives.Currently, there are no other such MR compatible systems which combine a VR presentation system with intuitive interaction in this way.Using their gaze (ie, just looking at objects or areas in the VR environment) , so the user can navigate through the virtual world, to select content such as films and games, play games and to initiate or terminate a video link to their companion/carer.The latter means that an anxious patient can interact at will with a companion or carer at any time during their examination via a webcam with microphone and a display monitor installed in the console area.The researchers say the next steps for the system is to develop content and test it with patients. Developing the right content is crucial, as for the system to be effective it needs to maintain a subject/patient s attention and their sense of immersion for as long as possible. As this content is likely to be very different depending on age and cognitive capabilities, getting this right and tailoring it for different clinical and study populations is a key next step,  Dr Qian said.Co-author Dr Tomoki Arichi said:  We are very excited about the possibilities that this system opens up for vulnerable and important populations like children and those with difficulties which might mean they can t normally have a MRI scan without being put to sleep. Not only could this make an enormous difference for everyday clinical practice, but it also opens the way for us to gain dramatic new insight into how patterns of brain function, behaviour and social skills develop across our lives.

The finding, published online in Science Translational Medicine, could lead to new types of cancer immunotherapies. By effectively removing these immune-suppressive cells inside tumors instead of in the whole body, the immune system can attack cancers without causing harmful autoimmune conditions,  said study leader Yang-Xin Fu, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pathology, Immunology, and Radiation Oncology at UT Southwestern. Dr. Fu co-led this study with Anli Zhang, Ph.D., and Zhenhua Ren, Ph.D., two postdoctoral researchers in his lab.For decades, researchers have known that the immune system not only plays a key role in battling cancers through the direct action of killer T cells and other components, but also opposes these efforts through cells known as regulatory T cells (Tregs). These Tregs help to regulate the immune response by preventing various immune cells from becoming overactive and causing autoimmune diseases. However, they also accumulate in tumors, shielding them from immune attack.Tregs maintain a balance of two proteins on their surfaces   CTLA-4 and CD47   that respectively broadcast  eat me  and  don t eat me  signals to phagocytes that keep Tregs in check, explained Dr. Fu. Various immunotherapies have sought to boost the  eat me  signal or decrease the  don t eat me signal  to reduce Tregs in tumors. However, each strategy has drawbacks: Increasing the  eat me  signal has systemic effects that spur autoimmunity, while decreasing the  don t eat me  signal has only shown promise for treating blood cancers, such as leukemias.Searching for a new way to deplete Tregs, Drs. Fu, Zhang, Ren, and their colleagues created a two-arm molecule that simultaneously increases the  eat me  signal while blocking the  don t eat me  signal to prompt phagocytes to consume those immune suppressive cells. When it was injected into mouse models of colon cancer, they found that it preferentially depleted Tregs in tumors without affecting those in the rest of the body, sparing the animals from treatment-induced autoimmune disease. However, dosing these animals with equivalent, separate amounts of the  eat me  booster and  don t eat me  blocker had systemic autoimmune side effects, suggesting that combining them within one molecule is key to reaching Tregs in tumors.As the number of Tregs decreased with treatment, the animals  tumors shrank significantly. This strategy also worked in mice carrying human lung cancer tumors, suggesting that it could be viable in human patients. In the past, there s been no way to get rid of these suppressive Tregs without severe toxicity,  Dr. Fu said.  Our study suggests a way to this outcome. Dr. Fu holds the Mary Nell and Ralph B.

The small, carefully monitored clinical trial is the first to demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody can prevent malaria in people. The trial was sponsored and conducted by scientists from the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, and was funded by NIAID. The findings were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Malaria continues to be a major cause of illness and death in many regions of the world, especially in infants and young children; therefore, new tools are needed to prevent this deadly disease,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  The results reported today suggest that a single infusion of a monoclonal antibody can protect people from malaria for at least 9 months. Additional research is needed, however, to confirm and extend this finding. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 229 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide in 2019, resulting in an estimated 409,000 deaths, mostly in children in sub-Saharan Africa. So far, no licensed or experimental malaria vaccine that has completed Phase 3 testing provides more than 50% protection from the disease over the course of a year or longer.Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. The mosquito injects the parasites in a form called sporozoites into the skin and bloodstream. These travel to the liver, where they mature and multiply. Then the mature parasite spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream to cause illness. P. falciparum is the Plasmodium species most likely to result in severe malaria infections, which, if not promptly treated, may lead to death.Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that antibodies can prevent malaria by neutralizing the sporozoites of P. falciparum in the skin and blood before they can infect liver cells. The NIAID trial tested whether a neutralizing monoclonal antibody called CIS43LS could safely provide a high level of protection from malaria in adults following careful, voluntary, laboratory-based exposure to infected mosquitos in the United States.CIS43LS was derived from a naturally occurring neutralizing antibody called CIS43. Researchers led by Robert A. Seder, M.D., chief of the Cellular Immunology Section of the VRC Immunology Laboratory, isolated CIS43 from the blood of a volunteer who had received an investigational malaria vaccine. The scientists found that CIS43 binds to a unique site on a parasite surface protein that is important for facilitating malaria infection and is the same on all variants of P. falciparum sporozoites worldwide. The researchers subsequently modified this antibody to extend the amount of time it would remain in the bloodstream, creating CIS43LS.After animal studies of CIS43LS for malaria prevention yielded promising results, VRC investigators launched a Phase 1 clinical trial of the experimental antibody with 40 healthy adults ages 18 to 50 years who had never had malaria or been vaccinated for the disease. The trial was led by Martin Gaudinski, M.D., medical director of the VRC Clinical Trials Program, and was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in Silver Spring, Maryland.During the first half of the trial, the study team gave 21 participants one dose of CIS43LS by either an intravenous infusion or an injection under the skin. The infusions ranged from 5 to 40 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight, and the subcutaneous injections were 5 mg/kg. Investigators followed the participants for 6 months to learn whether the infusions and subcutaneous injections of the various doses of the experimental antibody were safe and well tolerated. In addition, they measured the amount of CIS43LS in the blood to determine its durability over time.   In the second half of the trial, six participants who had received an intravenous infusion during the first half of the trial continued to participate. Four of these participants received a second antibody infusion while the other two did not. In addition, four new participants joined the study and received a single intravenous infusion of CIS43LS. Another seven people joined the study as controls who did not receive the antibody. All participants in the second half of the trial provided informed consent to be exposed to the malaria parasite in what is known as a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). In this procedure, volunteers are exposed to P. falciparum through bites of infected mosquitos in a carefully controlled setting, then are closely monitored by medical staff for several weeks and promptly treated if they develop malaria. CHMI has been used for decades to generate information about the safety and protective effect of malaria vaccine candidates and potential antimalarial drugs.Nine participants who had received CIS43LS and six participants who served as controls voluntarily underwent CHMI and were closely monitored for 21 days. Within that period, none of the nine participants who had received CIS43LS developed malaria, but five of the six controls did. The participants with malaria received standard therapy to eliminate the infection. Among the nine participants who received CIS43LS and were protected, seven underwent CHMI approximately 4 weeks after their infusion. The other two participants had received their sole infusion during the first half of the study and were infected approximately 9 months later. These results indicate that just one dose of the experimental antibody can prevent malaria for 1 to 9 months after infusion. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence that administration of an anti-malaria monoclonal antibody is safe and can prevent malaria infection in humans. To build on this finding, a larger Phase 2 clinical trial is underway in Mali to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIS43LS at preventing malaria infection in adults during a six-month malaria season. The trial is being led by Peter D. Crompton, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Malaria Infection Biology and Immunity Section in the NIAID Laboratory of Immunogenetics, and Kassoum Kayentao, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D., a professor at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali. NIAID is sponsoring and funding the trial. Results are expected in early 2022.In addition, VRC scientists are conducting further research on CIS43LS in the United States to determine the lowest dose that protects people from malaria infection.  Monoclonal antibodies may represent a new approach for preventing malaria in travelers, military personnel and health care workers traveling to malaria-endemic regions,  said Dr. Seder.  Further research will determine whether monoclonal antibodies can also be used for the seasonal control of malaria in Africa and ultimately for malaria-elimination campaigns.

This scarring disrupts the marrow s production of blood cells and causes severe anemia that leaves patients weak and fatigued. The scarring also reduces the number of platelets in the blood, making clotting difficult, and often causes an enlarged spleen. Current therapies only provide symptomatic relief without offering significant improvement of bone marrow fibrosis. So, there is a critical need to develop more effective therapy for myelofibrosis,  said senior researcher Golam Mohi, PhD, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.  We have identified CDK6, a regulator of cell cycle, as a new therapeutic target in myelofibrosis. We demonstrate that CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with ruxolitinib markedly inhibits myelofibrosis, suggesting this drug combination could be an effective therapeutic strategy against this devastating blood disorder.

These  may represent key players in the response to Arctic marine oil spills.   The study also confirmed that providing nutrients can enhance hydrocarbon biodegradation under these low temperature conditions,  said Dr. Hubert. The impetus for this work:  These permanently cold waters are seeing increasing industrial activity related to maritime shipping and offshore oil and gas sector activities,  said Dr. Hubert. Sean Murphy, Dr. Hubert's student, who grew up in the region, instigated the project. Mr. Murphy, Aquatic Scientist, ERM Canada, had noted both the benefit offshore oil had brought to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, but had been deeply troubled by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and had focused his masters research on the Labrador Sea to  help inform future oil spill mitigation strategies  at cold temperatures in the region.  The Labrador coast where the study took place is important for Indigenous peoples who rely on the ocean for food, and that unlike at lower latitudes, there s been a dearth of research on bioremediation this far north, Dr. Hubert noted.  As climate change extends ice-free periods and increasing industrial activity takes place in the Arctic, it is important to understand the ways in which the Arctic marine microbiome will respond if there is an oil or fuel spill,  said Dr. Hubert. That s especially important, as  this region remains vast and remote such that oil spill emergency response would be complicated and slow."" In the study, the investigators simulated oil spill remediation inside of bottles, by combining mud from the top few centimeters of seabed with artificial seawater, and with either diesel or crude oil, along with different nutrient amendments at different concentrations. The experiments were performed at 4 C, to approximate the temperature in the Labrador Sea, and took place over several weeks.  Our simulations demonstrated that naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria in the ocean represent nature s first responders to an oil spill,  said Dr. Hubert.

The findings could bolster diabetes research efforts and eventually lead to new replacement therapies for the disease. The findings are published in the journal Genes and Development.Researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL) and the University of Barcelona studied the RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor gene, also known as REST, in mouse and zebrafish models as well as in human pancreatic organoids. Researchers have previously suspected a role for this gene in pancreas development, though studies so far have been inconclusive. They found that REST is expressed in embryonic pancreatic cells which are yet to differentiate, also known as progenitor cells, as well as in adult cells which form the pancreatic duct. The researchers did not detect REST activity in adult beta-cells that produce insulin.Experiments with mouse models revealed that knocking the REST gene out at the early embryonic stage, before the pancreas is formed, resulted in doubling the number of insulin-producing cells. The cells were maintained into adulthood, with all mice showing normal weight. Further experiments using zebrafish models found similar boosts to beta-cell formation.Inactivating REST was not able to boost beta cell formation after the pancreas has already formed. Mice with inactivated rest soon after birth exhibited a short-lived boost to endocrine cell formation, but this was not sustained through adulthood. Inactivating REST in human pancreatic organoids did not lead to beta-cell formation, though researchers did detect increased activity of endocrine genes. Though important for the development of the pancreas, we have shown that REST is not the sole guardian of endocrine differentiation. However, if one day we come up with a future cocktail of drugs to boost insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, I suspect that REST inhibitors would be part of the recipe. We are now testing whether REST inhibitors can be used to artificially boost the formation of beta cells in a dish,  says Jorge Ferrer, senior author of the study and Group Leader of the Regulatory Genomics and Diabetes at the CRG.New therapies and treatments that can boost or replace the number of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas would transform the treatment of diabetes, which affects over 400 million people worldwide. For people with type-1 diabetes, the only alternative treatment to daily insulin shots are transplantations, requiring potential side effects through taking immunosuppressant medication and hampered by a shortage of organ donors. Being able to boost existing numbers directly in the pancreas would circumvent many of these hurdles. REST joins a very short list of dominant suppressors of endocrine differentiation during pancreas development,  says Meritxell Rovira, co-author of the study and researcher with joint affiliation with IDIBELL and the University of Barcelona.  REST modulators will most likely play an important role for future manipulations to promote endocrinogenesis in experimental model systems or replacement therapies for diabetes.

The dendrimer is a chemically-created molecule with tentacles branching out in a highly-symmetrical structure around a central core. The research describes how dendrimer tentacles arranged incredibly closely to each other   less than one nanometer apart - avoided detection by the complement system, part of our immune system. Our immune system is equipped with many tools to recognise and eliminate invaders. For example, our blood contains sensors belonging to a family of defence system known as the  complement system , which recognises unique patterns expressed by invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Binding of these sensors to pathogens alarms the immune system and triggers an immune response. These sensors are termed  complement pattern-recognition (CPR)  molecules. CPR can sense surface patterns that are regularly repeated so close to each other, for instance in 2 15 nanometer ranges - a distance, which is at least 5000 times thinner than the thickness of a typical sheet of paper. The international team discovered however, that the CPR could not sense patterns repeated closer to each other, for instance, at 1 nanometer or less. At a nanoscale level, the team grew tiny particles known as dendrimers which are shaped like trees with many branches   or tiny tentacles. The number of tentacles exponentially increases with dendrimer size and the tentacles are positioned less than 1 nanometer from each other. The ends of tentacles are where regular patterns appear. Depending on chemical structure of these patterns, they found that these dendrimers could escape detection by the CPR radar. Professor Moein Moghimi explains:  This discovery shows that we can develop certain dendrimers as very tiny carriers to smuggle drugs into the body without triggering our immune system. Activation of the complement system as the defence mechanisms of our immune system can sometimes result in inflammation and may also induce anaphylactic reactions. One example is we have seen anaphylaxis in some recipients of COVID-19 vaccines, which uses small lipid particles and instead with dendrimers we could avoid these adverse reactions. Dendrimers offer us the ability to deliver drugs to diseased sites where inflammation is a major problem such as in conditions like atherosclerosis, cancer, macular degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis,  said Dr. Panagiotis Trohopoulos, cardiologist and managing director of CosmoPHOS Ltd (Thessaloniki, Greece), co-author of the paper.  This could allow medical teams to treat these conditions without triggering the patient s own immune system. That is why we chose dendrimers in an ongoing therapeutic study in atherosclerosis,  said Dr. Trohopoulos. The team suggests that since these complement-evading dendrimers are so tiny they could also be used to camouflage surfaces of implants and many biomedical devices like cardiovascular stents, protecting them against attack by the complement system.  The researchers also say that these findings suggest that some very dangerous bacteria and viruses could be exploiting patterns to escape our immune system. For example, it might be possible that pathogens display surface patterns with less than 1 nanometer periodicity from each other in order to escape the complement system radar and survive inside the host. Finally, the team also found that a special type of dendrimer (those bearing amine groups on their tentacles) hitchhike on an immune molecule called immunoglobulin M (IgM).  With these dendrimers the ride was not free; jumping on IgM dented its structure and this triggered the complement response,  said Prof. Moghimi. The interdisciplinary team intends to develop the work further examining the potential for drug delivery, vaccine design, and device bioengineering, as well as the basic understanding of microbial evasion from our immune system.

Natural freshwater resources lakes, rivers, groundwater are under severe stress due to adverse impacts of climate change, coupled with gradually increasing population in metropolises around the globe,  says SenGupta, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and chemical and biomolecular engineering in Lehigh University s P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science.  Municipal wastewater treatment plants in large cities are insulated from the negative effects of climate change, and treated wastewater can serve as a potential water source, provided appropriate sustainable and cost-effective technologies are available. In 2019, SenGupta and his doctoral students at Lehigh were awarded a U.S. patent for their innovative CO2 driven ion exchange desalination process, HIX-Desal, which he calls  a legitimate candidate to transform wastewater into usable water. Existing wastewater desalination systems, such as those employed in California by the Orange County Water District in and the city of San Diego, use semipermeable reverse osmosis (RO) membrane processes that require a separate electrical and/or mechanical energy source. Approximately 1 to 1.5 kWh of energy is required to produce 1000 liters (264 gallons) of treated water, or just over the average amount three Americans use at home each day.HIX-Desal harnesses the unique chemistry of CO2 to replace that energy requirement. And, SenGupta says, when paired with existing generators of carbon dioxide (such as cement plants and anaerobic waste digestion processes), the process can be effectively carbon negative. Carbon dioxide, which is safe to handle and nonhazardous, can serve both as a weak acid and a weak base concurrently in a single process for desalination,  he says,  avoiding the need for energy-intensive RO membrane processes.  The system also reduces water pretreatment required to protect the membrane in reverse osmosis setups, resulting in cost savings. Initial studies of HIX-Desal were conducted on Lehigh s doorstep in collaboration with the City of Bethlehem in Pennsylvania. SenGupta s team, which includes graduate student Hao Chen, a P.C. Rossin Doctoral Fellow studying environmental engineering, and Nick Donato, an undergraduate research scholar, will gain new insight into the energy advantages and scalability of the technology in a new collaboration with the Lehigh County Authority s wastewater treatment plan in neighboring Allentown.The two-year project was recently funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, as part of an $5.8 million investment in 22 laboratory and pilot-scale desalination research projects to enable broader deployment of desalination and recycled water technologies.The Kline s Island plant in Allentown treats nearly 35 million gallons every day, says SenGupta, and ongoing investigations show that the salinity of the treated wastewater can be reduced by more than 60 percent by the HIX-Desal process, without requiring any reverse osmosis. If successfully deployed using carbon dioxide from the facility s anaerobic digester, he explains, the technology could lead to a savings of approximately 1 million kWh per day (or about enough energy to power 94 U.S. homes for a year).Additionally, recent tests confirmed another potential benefit: In July 2021, SenGupta's team collected samples of treated wastewater from the plant and completed the first cyclic process. The results, he says, revealed that the phosphate (responsible for algae growth and eutrophication) present in the plant s wastewater can be selectively removed, concentrated, and recovered as a potential fertilizer in pure form, ready for direct field application.Overall, SenGupta sees huge potential in validating that waste carbon dioxide, whether from landfills or gas turbine exhaust, can be used to desalinate municipal wastewater and water from other impaired sources (such as what's used for cooling applications in power plants or industrial facilities). This concept forms the basis of a circular economy, in which waste from one process is a potential resource in another process,  he says.  It s a great challenge, but one that s exciting as well.

As we re trying to figure out the risk of getting listeria from soil and different locations, our group created a more systematic way of assessing how frequently different listeria are found in different locations,  said senior author Martin Wiedmann, Ph.D.  97, the Gellert Family Professor in Food Safety and Food Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.  We ve studied listeria in places as diverse as New York, Colorado and California, but before this atlas, [it] was difficult to make comparisons and assess listeria diversity in different locations.  Listeria mononcytogenes in foods can make people extremely sick. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that each year 1,600 people in the U.S. get listeriosis; of those, about 260 die. Knowing that listeria occurs naturally in soil, the Cornell group asked hundreds of other scientists across the country to scoop up soil samples from generally undisturbed places in the natural world, such as the off-trail areas of state and national parks. From these samples, the group developed a nationwide atlas of 1,854 listeria isolates, representing 594 strains and 12 families of the bacteria called phylogroups. Lead author Jingqiu Liao, Ph.D.  20, who worked in Wiedmann s laboratory as a graduate student, is now a post-doctoral researcher at Columbia University. She had supplemented the research by acquiring soil samples in her own travels and found listeria present across a wide range of environmental circumstances. This bacterium is controlled mainly by soil moisture, salinity concentrations and molybdenum   a trace mineral found in milk, cheese, grains, legumes, leafy vegetables and organ meats.  The goal of this work was to systematically collect soil samples across the United States,  said Liao,  and to capture the true large-scale spatial distribution, genomic diversity and population structure of listeria species in the natural environment.  With whole genome sequencing and comprehensive population genomics analyses,  Liao said,  we provided answers to the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial genome flexibility   an important open question in the field of microbiology.  Liao explained that this work can serve as a reference for future population genomics studies and will likely benefit the food industry by locating listeria contaminations that may have a natural origin. If listeria is found in a processing facility in the western U.S., for example, and that facility had used ingredients from a distant state, Wiedmann said,  knowing the genomic information of listeria isolates and their possible locations across the U.S., we can better narrow the origins to a specific region.

For example, Tahquamenon Falls, a popular Upper Peninsula destination, is known for the caramel color of its chutes. That color comes from leaf and bark debris that make tannins   polyphenols, or naturally occurring organic compounds in plants. It s this debris that absorbs sunlight and creates the singlet oxygen that degrades contaminants. This reactive species of oxygen causes what s called photochemical transformation, a process in which light and oxidizing materials produce chemical reactions. But how long does it take for a particular chemical to break down under this sunny and vegetative onslaught?Understanding how many hours or days it takes a particular contaminant to break down halfway helps environmental engineers and scientists protect our waterways. Knowing a particular chemical s half-life helps resource managers estimate whether or not that chemical is building up in the environment.Daisuke Minakata, associate professor of civil, environmental and geospatial engineering at Michigan Technological University, developed a comprehensive reactive activity model that shows how singlet oxygen s reaction mechanisms perform against a diverse group of contaminants and computes their half-life in a natural aquatic environment. We tested 100 different organic, structurally diverse compounds,  Minakata said.  If we know the reactivity between singlet oxygen and contaminants, we can say how long it will take to degrade one specific structure of a contaminant down to half the concentration.

This is the first time Marburg, a highly infectious disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, has been identified in the country, and in West Africa.Marburg, which is in the same family as the virus that causes Ebola, was detected less than two months after Guinea declared an end to an Ebola outbreak that erupted earlier this year. Samples taken from a now-deceased patient and tested by a field laboratory in Gueckedou as well as Guinea s national haemorrhagic fever laboratory turned out positive for the Marburg virus. Further analysis by the Institut Pasteur in Senegal confirmed the result. The patient had sought treatment at a local clinic in Koundou area of Gueckedou, where a medical investigation team had been dispatched to probe his worsening symptoms.  We applaud the alertness and the quick investigative action by Guinea s health workers. The potential for the Marburg virus to spread far and wide means we need to stop it in its tracks,  said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa.  We are working with the health authorities to implement a swift response that builds on Guinea s past experience and expertise in managing Ebola, which is transmitted in a similar way.  Gueckedou, where Marburg has been confirmed, is also the same region where cases of the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea as well as the 2014 2016 West Africa outbreak were initially detected. Efforts are underway to find the people who may have been in contact with the patient. As the disease is appearing for the first time in the country, health authorities are launching public education and community mobilization to raise awareness and galvanize support to help curb widespread infection. An initial team of 10 WHO experts, including epidemiologists and socio-anthropologists is on the ground helping to investigate the case and supporting the national health authorities to swiftly step up emergency response, including risk assessment, disease surveillance, community mobilization, testing, clinical care, infection prevention as well as logistical support. Cross-border surveillance is also being enhanced to quickly detect any cases, with neighbouring countries on alert. The Ebola control systems in place in Guinea and in neighbouring countries are proving crucial to the emergency response to the Marburg virus. Marburg is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, surfaces and materials. Illness begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic signs within seven days. Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in past outbreaks depending on virus strain and case management. Although there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat the virus, supportive care   rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids   and treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. A range of potential treatments, including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies, are being evaluated. In Africa, previous outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.

A new study, which appears in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier aims to better understand those molecular events; showing that genes are expressed differently in the brains of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) compared to those not using opioids. These changes may explain not only the addictive properties of opioids but what ultimately causes harm to the brain and the person suffering with opioid use disorder,  said Ryan Logan, PhD, an Associate Professor at Boston University s School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA and senior author of the study. These gaps in our understanding of opioids  actions in the brain limits our ability to develop more effective therapies,  Dr. Logan explained.  To address this, we employed new methods to identify novel molecular players directly in the brains of people who struggled with opioid use disorder. Dr. Logan and his team obtained autopsy brain tissue from 20 subjects with OUD and chronic opioid use, and 20 without a history of opioid use. To identify differing patterns of gene expression, they used RNA sequencing (RNAseq), a technique that reflects how strongly genes are being expressed in a given tissue. RNAseq of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, two brain areas strongly associated with addiction pathophysiology, showed that certain genes were expressed differently in people with OUD compared to controls. The affected genes fell into two broad categories: genes encoding proinflammatory immune molecules; and those involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which suggests that connections between neurons may have been altered by opioid use. The results also indicated that the brain s resident immune cells, called microglia, were present at higher levels in the brains of people with OUD. We discovered several important molecular pathways that are integral in mediating the consequences of chronic opioid use on the brain. These molecules are responsible for shaping and maintaining the local environment required for neurons to function properly, as well as molecules critical for local inflammation that may impact the brain s response to opioids. Together, these players represent new targets in both the pathology and treatment of opioid use disorder,  said Dr. Logan. John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, said of the study:  The deeper we understand opioid use disorders, the more complex is the biology that emerges. This study highlights that opioid dependency is associated with expected changes in markers of neural response and plasticity, but also with neuro-inflammatory changes associated with microglia. These findings suggest important new directions that can be followed in larger studies and that broaden our view of the neurobiology, and potentially treatment, of opioid use disorder.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/beige-fat-plays-an-essential-role-in-protecting-the-brain-from-dementia-351912,Beige Fat Plays an Essential Role in Protecting the Brain From Dementia Scientists have shown that beige fat cells are  indispensable  to the neuroprotective and anti inflammatory effects of subcutaneous fat  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Beige is considered a calming paint color, and scientists have new evidence that beige fat has a similar impact on the brain, bringing down the inflammation associated with the more common white fat and providing protection from dementia.They have found that beige fat cells, which are typically intermingled with white fat cells in the subcutaneous fat present on  pear shaped  people, mediate subcutaneous fat s brain protection, Dr. Alexis M. Stranahan and her colleagues report in the journal Nature Communications.Pear-shaped people, whose weight is generally distributed more evenly, rather than  apple shaped  individuals with fat clustered around their middle and often around internal organs like the liver in the abdominal cavity, are considered less at risk for cardiometabolic problems like heart disease and diabetes, as well as cognitive decline, says Stranahan, neuroscientist at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.Now the scientists have shown that beige fat cells, or adipocytes, are  indispensable  to the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of subcutaneous fat, says Stranahan, the study s corresponding author.In fact without beige adipocytes, in the face of a high-fat diet, they saw subcutaneous fat start acting more like dangerous visceral fat, says Stranahan who reported last year in The Journal of Clinical Investigation that visceral adiposity sends a message to resident immune cells in the brain to fire up the inflammation, which ultimately damages cognition.  It s a very different signature,  she says. Visceral fat around the organs is mostly white fat cells, which store energy as triglycerides, which are yet another fat type found in the blood, and a risk factor for heart disease and stroke at high levels. Particularly in younger people, subcutaneous fat is a mixture of white and beige fat cells, and these beige cells are more like brown fat cells, which are packed with powerhouses called mitochondria and are efficient at using fat and sugars to produce heat in a process called thermogenesis. Exercise and cold exposure are said to enable the so-called  beiging  of white fat cells.For some of their studies, the scientists used male mice with a specific gene knocked out that prevents adipocytes in the subcutaneous fat from beiging or browning, effectively resulting in subcutaneous fat that is more like visceral fat.On a high-fat diet, it s already been shown that these mice develop diabetes more rapidly than those with normal amounts of beige fat. It s also known that transplanting subcutaneous fat into an obese mouse will improve their metabolic profile in a few weeks, and she wanted to know about potential impact on cognitive problems.While both the normal and knockout mice gained about the same amount of weight over four weeks, mice without functional beige fat displayed accelerated cognitive dysfunction on testing, and their brains and bodies indicated a strong, rapid inflammatory response to the high-fat diet that included activation of microglial cells, those resident immune cells in the brain, which can further heighten inflammation and contribute to dementia and other brain problems.  Before they ever developed diabetes, the microglia of the mice, whose ages were comparable to a 20-something-year-old, had already turned on numerous inflammatory markers. Interestingly normal mice they studied as controls also turned on these markers but turned on anti-inflammatory markers as well apparently to minimize any response.Normally it takes mice about three months on a high-fat diet to show the kind of responses they saw in the beige-fat knockouts in a single month.To further explore the impact of beige fat, they also transplanted subcutaneous fat from young, lean healthy mice into the visceral compartment of otherwise normal but now-obese mice who had developed dementia-like behavior after remaining on a high-fat diet for 10 to 12 weeks.Transplanting the subcutaneous fat resulted in improved memory, restoring essentially normal synaptic plasticity   the ability of the connections between neurons to adapt so they can communicate   in the hippocampus, the center of learning and memory deep in the brain. These positive changes were dependent on the beige adipocytes in the donor subcutaneous fat, Stranahan and her colleagues write.Transplants from the beige-fat knockouts on the other hand did not improve cognition in the obese mice, including by strictly objective measures like any increased electrical activity between neurons. If we can figure out what it is about beige fat that limits inflammation and maybe what it is about beige fat that improves brain plasticity, then maybe we can mimic that somehow with a drug or with cold-stimulated beiging or even taking out some of your subcutaneous fat when you are young, freezing it and giving it back to you when you are older,  Stranahan says.All fat tends to be packed with immune cells, which can both promote and calm inflammation. They found beige fat interacts continuously with those immune cells, inducing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 in the subcutaneous fat. IL-4 in turn is required for cold to stimulate the  beiging  of fat, she notes.Also in turn, the fat induced IL-4 in microglia and T cells, key drivers of the immune response, in the meninges, a sort of multilayer cap that fits over the brain to help protect it. They also found T cells in the choroid plexus, where cerebrospinal fluid is produced, had calming IL-4 induced.Their findings suggest IL-4 is directly involved in communication between beige adipocytes and neurons in the hippocampus, the scientists write. It s kind of like  Whisper Down the Lane  if you ever played that at camp,  Stranahan says of what appears to be a calming chain of communication.When Stranahan and her team looked further they found it was the recipient s own T cells in the meninges that were called to positive, protective action by the transplanted beige fat cells, not immune cells from the transplanted fat itself.There is evidence that in chronic obesity, your own immune cells can reach the brain, and there was no evidence in this case that it was the donor s immune cells making the journey. It s exciting because we have a way for peripheral immune cells to interact with the brain in a way that promotes cognition,  Stranahan says, noting that there also are many bad things immune cells could do in the brain like contribute to stroke and Alzheimer s.Her many next goals include learning more about how much it matters where you put the transplanted fat, like whether transferring subcutaneous fat to a subcutaneous area might work even better to protect against cognitive decline; whether transplanting visceral fat to a subcutaneous area decreases its damaging effect; and better understanding how subcutaneous fat sends what appears to be an active anti-inflammatory message. She also wants to explore these issues in female mice since the current studies were limited to males.But what they and others already are finding underscores the importance of inherent fat distribution, which could be a biomarker for those most at risk for cognitive decline, she says.The stage of obesity may be another factor, because she also has early evidence suggesting that the longer a high-fat diet is maintained and the more subcutaneous fat increases, its protective powers decrease and visceral fat increases.Even in a healthy, non-obese young person visceral fat is going to produce higher levels of basal inflammation, Stranahan notes.Stranahan emphasizes that she does not want her findings to cause excessive concern in overweight individuals or generate more prejudice against them, rather the work is about better identifying risk factors and different points and methods of intervention to fit the needs of individuals. Stranahan and her colleagues reported in 2015 in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity that a high-fat diet prompts microglia to become uncharacteristically sedentary and to start eating the connections between neurons.  In adults, brown fat is primarily located between the shoulder blades and in the upper chest. Evidence suggests we can increase brown and beige fat cells by exposing ourselves to cooler to cold temperatures for several hours daily and through intense exercise. These approaches also can prompt the beiging of white fat. Most of us probably have some combination of fat cell types: mostly white, less beige and even less brown, she says.Reference: Guo D-H, Yamamoto M, Hernandez CM, Khodadadi H, Baban B, Stranahan AM.

Depending on the tissue, they fulfill a plethora of essential tasks, such as the transport of mucus in trachea, providing access to nutrients and inducing the left-right asymmetry during embryonic development. In their role as controllers of large-scale fluid transport, motile cilia undergo cyclic beating strokes. By this, they communicate mechanical signals to neighboring cilia and collectively create so-called metachronal waves. Typically, thousands of cilia are involved in the creation of such a wave and thus their movement needs to be well regulated to ensure   and optimize   their biological function. Due to the overwhelming complexity and multi-scale nature of the phenomenon, a mechanistic understanding of the self-organization of cilia into metachronal waves has so far been lacking.  Our model allows an in-depth understanding of the organization of cilia arrays , explains Professor Ramin Golestanian, principal investigator of the study and Director of the Department of Living Matter Physics at the MPIDS.

Results are therefore regarded as preliminary and should be interpreted as such. Find out about the role of the peer review process in research here.

The lab, led by Olga Vechtomova, a Waterloo Engineering professor cross-appointed in Computer Science, has been researching creative applications of AI for several years. The lab s initial work led to the creation of a system that learns musical expressions of artists and generates lyrics in their style.Recently, Vechtomova, along with Waterloo graduate students Gaurav Sahu and Dhruv Kumar, developed technology that relies on various aspects of music such as chord progressions, tempo and instrumentation to synthesize lyrics reflecting the mood and emotions expressed by live music. As a musician or a band plays instrumental music, the system continuously receives the raw audio clips, which the neural network processes to generate new lyric lines. The artists can then use the lines to compose their own song lyrics.  The purpose of the system is not to write a song for the artist,  Vechtomova explains.  Instead, we want to help artists realize their own creativity. The system generates poetic lines with new metaphors and expressions, potentially leading the artists in creative directions that they haven t explored before. The neural network designed by the researchers learns what lyrical themes, words and stylistic devices are associated with different aspects of music captured in each audio clip. For example, the researchers observed that lyrics generated for ambient music are very different than those for upbeat music.The research team conducted a user study, inviting musicians to play live instruments while using the system.  One unexpected finding was that participants felt encouraged by the generated lines to improvise,  Vechtomova said.  For example, the lines inspired artists to structure chords a bit differently and take their improvisation in a new direction than originally intended. Some musicians also used the lines to check if their improvisation had the desired emotional effect. Another finding from the study highlighted the co-creative aspect of the experience. Participants commented that they viewed the system as an uncritical jamming partner and felt encouraged to play their musical instruments even if they were not actively trying to write lyrics. Since LyricJam went live in June this year, over 1,500 users worldwide have tried it out.Reference: Vechtomova O, Sahu G, Kumar D.

Published today in Cell Reports, the research marks a major step toward successfully developing a universal vaccine for not only COVID-19, but also potentially for influenza, HIV and other deadly global viruses.  We ve developed a predictive tool that can tell you ahead of time which antibodies are going to be effective against circulating strains of virus,  said lead author Timothy Whitehead, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering.  But the implications for this technology are more profound: If you can predict what the variants will be in a given season, you could get vaccinated to match the sequence that will occur and short-circuit this seasonal variation.  The research team s secret ingredient? Baker s yeast. They developed a genetically modified version of this innocuous material to express some of SARS-CoV-2 s viral spike proteins along the yeast s surface, with which they can map resulting mutations that form and escape neutralizing antibodies. The resulting roadmap could inform the development of more effective booster vaccines and tailored antibody treatments for patients with severe cases of COVID-19, said Whitehead.

This project shows that some of the conclusions we may want to draw about autism from other tasks may not be as widely generalizable as we think,  says Peter Pfordresher, a professor of psychology in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences and a co-author of the study, which was led by Fang Liu, associate professor of psychology and clinical language sciences at the University of Reading.The research team found that autistic children and adults were better at imitating and holding relative pitch than they were with absolute pitch across both speech and music domains. There s a significant distinction between the two that is illustrated using the melody associated with the nursery rhyme  Mary Had a Little Lamb. Absolute pitch is the specific note associated with each syllable in a song. Think about the seven notes you would produce when singing  Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Absolute pitch is the ability to sing each note correctly, essentially matching the notes after hearing the tune. This definition differs from what musical performers would call absolute, or sometimes, perfect pitch, which refers to the ability to identify or sing a note without an immediate reference.Relative pitch, meanwhile, is the pitch change from one note to the next, or the interval separating the pitch in the first syllable of  Mary  from the word s second syllable. Previous research in areas such as action imitation has suggested that people with ASD can reproduce the end goal of another s action, but not the exact form in which the action is carried out. That s where we see atypical imitation,  says Liu.As an example, Liu says that an autistic individual, when asked to imitate the action of reaching for a cup, might just get the cup without trying to mimic the exact trajectory of the arm as it goes through the reaching motion. Our research on vocal imitation suggests something similar: Autistic participants performed better on imitating the structure of a tune (relative pitch) than they did on the exact form (absolute pitch). And this has significance when thinking about music in a broad cultural sense.Pfordresher, an expert on the relationship between music and language, says there is mounting evidence demonstrating the importance of collective interactions with music, in particular its ability to promote social bonding. People with autism have difficulties making social connections with people,  says Pfordresher.  Relative pitch is generally considered to be more important for music. However, absolute pitch is critical if you re singing with somebody, and singing in unison is important for making social connections. Clinicians working with autistic individuals may want to focus on these forms of imitation to help those with ASD foster musical interactions that could facilitate their ability to bond with others and to form relationships.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have now identified novel mechanistic insights how the drug exerts its antidepressant effect. The findings have been published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.According to the World Health Organization, depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and the disease affects more than 360 million people every year.The risk of suffering is affected by both genetics and environmental factors. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants, such as SSRIs, affect nerve signalling via monoamines in the brain. However, it can take a long time for these drugs to help, and over 30 percent of sufferers experience no relief at all.The need for new types of antidepressants with faster action and wider effect is therefore considerable. An important breakthrough is the anaesthetic ketamine, which has been registered for some years in the form of a nasal spray for the treatment of intractable depression.Unlike classic antidepressants, ketamine affects the nerve signalling that occurs via the glutamate system, but it is unclear exactly how the antidepressant effect is mediated. When the medicine has an effect, it relieves depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts very quickly.However, ketamine can cause unwanted side effects such as hallucinations and delusions and there may be a risk of abuse so alternative medicines are needed. The researchers want to better understand how ketamine works in order to find substances that can have the same rapid effect but without the side effects.In a new study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's antidepressant effects. Using experiments on both cells and mice, the researchers were able to show that ketamine reduced so-called presynaptic activity and the persistent release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.""Elevated glutamate release has been linked to stress, depression and other mood disorders, so lowered glutamate levels may explain some of the effects of ketamine,"" says Per Svenningsson, professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, and the study s last author.When nerve signals are transmitted, the transmission from one neuron to the next occurs via synapses, a small gap where the two neurons meet.The researchers were able to see that ketamine directly stimulated AMPA receptors, which sit postsynaptically, that is, the part of the nerve cell that receives signals and this leads to the increased release of the neurotransmitter adenosine which inhibits presynaptic glutamate release.The effects of ketamine could be counteracted by the researchers inhibiting presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors.""This suggests that the antidepressant action of ketamine can be regulated by a feedback mechanism. It is new knowledge that can explain some of the rapid effects of ketamine,"" says Per SvenningssonIn collaboration with Rockefeller University, the same research group has also recently reported on the disease mechanism in depression.The findings, also published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, show how the molecule p11 plays an important role in the onset of depression by affecting cells sitting on the surface of the brain cavity, ependymal cells, and the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.References: Seo J-S, Mantas I, Svenningsson P, Greengard P.

It has also exacerbated health risks for the people who populate them, particularly those who suffer from pulmonary diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These dynamics underscore the importance of work to increase the efficacy of drug delivery devices, such as inhalers, that administer active pharmaceutical ingredients to treat respiratory illnesses.In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, researchers from India and Australia describe the results of their collaboration in developing a computational evaluation of drug delivery through both pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers to determine how the process can be improved.While inhalers have revolutionized the treatment of pulmonary diseases in the last few decades and are currently being used to administer drugs to patients infected by the COVID-19 virus, ""their efficacy remains a great concern as only one-third of the total drug reaches the affected regions of the lungs,"" said co-author Suvash C. Saha, from the University of Technology Sydney. ""As a result, the drug loss and cost of the treatment become higher.""Knowing an ability to predict aerosolized or powdered drug deposition in the lungs is vital to better understand targeted drug delivery, Saha and colleagues at the Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, in India, created a computational model to evaluate where improvements can be made.""At higher flow rates, inertial impaction is found to be responsible for deposition of drug particles in the upper portion of the airways but with lesser availability of drug particles in the distal region of the airways,"" said co-author Akshoy Ranjan Paul. ""Additionally, at lower flow rates, there is not enough momentum to carry particles to the distal region. As a result, there should be an optimum flow rate [to achieve] maximum reach of drug particles in the distal region.""The researchers present a computational investigation of inhalation rates and drug particle sizes in a realistic human lung model. Using computation fluid dynamics, the study reveals that more drug particles are deposited in the right bronchi than in the left bronchi, which is relatively curved due its proximity to the heart. Key findings suggest the drugs should contain smaller-sized particles to enable their reach in the distal bronchi. The research ""is a notable example that demonstrates how the understanding of fluid mechanics, and the power of computational fluid dynamics, can inform more effective design of drugs and drug-administering devices,"" said Saha.Reference: Tiwari A, Jain A, Paul AR, Saha SC.

The findings, published online in Cancer Research, could help researchers develop drugs that circumvent resistance, validate new drug targets, or better understand the interaction between drugs and their target proteins. We believe this approach will be a very useful tool in the fight against cancer therapeutic resistance and could have potential in a variety of other areas of drug development,  said study leader Ralf Kittler, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Pharmacology in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development and the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. Kittler co-led the study with John D. Minna, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, Director of the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research and member of the Simmons Cancer Center.Targeted therapies represent a major advance in cancer treatment for multiple tumor types, comprising drugs that specifically alter the function of oncoproteins that drive tumors to grow and spread. They are often oral agents with low toxicity that provide symptom relief and prolong survival. However, explained Dr. Kittler, these drugs have a marked drawback: they lose effectiveness over time as tumors become resistant because the genes responsible for the targeted oncoproteins inevitably mutate, producing proteins that no longer bind the drugs. For example, patients with non-small cell lung cancer are often treated with drugs that inhibit a protein known as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) providing great clinical benefit; unfortunately, most of these tumors develop resistance to the treatment within about a year. This response has led to second-, third-, and even fourth-generation versions of such EGFR-targeting drugs to try to overcome this resistance.Although methods exist to predict mutations that will develop in cancer target genes   an important step toward developing drugs that can attack the resulting mutant proteins   these methods are cumbersome, expensive, time-consuming, or can only predict a limited type of mutation known as a point mutation, Dr. Kittler explained.Looking for a better way to predict therapeutic resistance, the researchers developed a technique they call LentiMutate. This approach relies on a class of viruses called lentiviruses to cause mutations. In contrast with human cells and many other viruses, lentiviruses take RNA and convert it to DNA while infecting its target cells to eventually produce proteins; however, this process is inherently error-prone, producing mutant mistakes in the resulting DNA.Working with a lentivirus engineered to make it even more error-prone, Dr. Kittler and his colleagues used the vector to insert EGFR RNA in human cells, causing the cells to produce mutant versions of this protein. They then dosed the cells with a commonly used inhibitor for EGFR called gefitinib to search for resistant cells. By sequencing the introduced single gene in the resistant cells, the researchers were able to identify several mutations that made EGFR resistant to gefitinib, a first-generation anti-EGFR drug, including those previously identified in human patients.Further experiments showed that LentiMutate was able to identify mutations that conferred resistance to the fourth-generation anti-EGFR drug osimertinib, which is now the standard of care for EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer. The approach also identified mutations that cause resistance to imatinib, a drug that targets the BCR-ABL1 protein, which drives chronic myelogenous leukemia, and AMG 510, a drug that targets a specific mutant form of the KRAS protein, which drives non-small cell lung cancer.Dr. Kittler noted that identifying these mutations through LentiMutate can greatly speed up the process of developing new drugs that can bind to the drug-resistant mutant proteins so that it takes weeks rather than years. LentiMutate could also be used in different ways in drug development: to confirm that new drugs are acting on the target protein and not a different one, to help researchers gain a better understanding of how drugs are interacting with their targets, or to develop new types of drugs for a variety of other diseases beyond cancer. Precision medicine that comes from sequencing a patient s tumor to identify specific proteins to target for therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, we need patients to be cured and not just benefit for 10 to 15 months from such targeted therapy,  said Dr. Minna.  To do this, we need to deal with drug resistance mutations, including by developing new drugs, and LentiMutate gives us an important new tool in our research armamentarium to help solve this pressing problem. Other UTSW researchers who contributed to this study include Paul Yenerall, Rahul K. Kollipara, Kimberley Avila, Michael Peyton, Yan Liu, and Kenneth D.

The Phase 2 trial is sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.The lifelong immunosuppressive therapy that organ transplant recipients must take to prevent organ rejection blunts their immune response to both pathogens and vaccines. Research has shown that many organ transplant recipients do not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, after receiving an authorized COVID-19 vaccine regimen. The purpose of the new study is to determine whether a third dose of one of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could overcome this problem for at least some kidney transplant recipients. This is particularly important because this population has a high prevalence of conditions that are risk factors for severe COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The pilot study also aims to identify characteristics that could help distinguish those kidney transplant recipients who would benefit from a third dose of an mRNA vaccine from those who will require a different approach to achieve protection. The pilot study findings will inform a subsequent, larger phase of the trial that includes higher-risk strategies to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ transplant recipients who do not respond to a third dose of an mRNA vaccine.The third-dose vaccine intervention was chosen because of the demonstrated safety of the two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen in solid organ transplant recipients as well as the efficacy of additional doses of other vaccines, such as those for hepatitis and influenza, in immunocompromised people.The pilot study, called COVID Protection After Transplant (CPAT), is being conducted at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore under the leadership of Dorry Segev, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Segev is the Marjory K. and Thomas Pozefsky professor of surgery and epidemiology, associate vice chair of the department of surgery, and director of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins University.

These new solvents work under mild conditions, have reduced toxicity and are more environmentally friendly compared with currently available solvents. This work may lead to improved technologies for the conversion of currently unused biomass to fuel.Biofuels, such as ethanol produced from switchgrass or sugarcane, may allow us to reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuels. However, the process of making biofuels usually requires breaking down the cellulose from plants, which consists of long polymer chains, into smaller sugar molecules. This is not a simple task, as illustrated by how unappetizing tree bark or grass stalks look to us humans. Cellulose has a complex hydrogen bonding network, which makes it extremely chemical resistant. Current methods for processing cellulose rely on harsh reaction conditions and toxic chemicals. Now, scientists from Kanazawa University have used a special class of molecules called  zwitterions  to create novel solvents with the ability to dissolve cellulose. Zwitterions are special in that they have both a positive and negative charge, but at different locations on the molecule so they cannot neutralize each other. These charges are highly effective at disrupting the hydrogen bonds keeping the cellulose from being broken down.  Because almost all zwitterions are solid under normal reaction conditions, our experiments used eutectic mixtures,  first author Gyanendra Sharma explains. A eutectic system is a mixture of substances with a melting point lower than that of its constituent parts. This is accomplished by using molecules with different structures, so that regular crystals are harder to form. In these experiments, the team mixed four different zwitterions at various ratios. They found 22 combinations that were liquid below 100 C. Of these, two mixtures were also highly effective at dissolving cellulose.  Our work shows that it is possible to replace many of the toxic chemicals used today with more environmentally friendly alternatives as we move towards a more renewable energy ecosystem,  senior author Kosuke Kuroda says. This research demonstrates the potential of using combinations of zwitterions to create mixtures with properties not possessed by any molecule individually.ReferenceSharma G, Takahashi K, Kuroda K.

Symptoms often show up by age 5; as the disease progresses, patients lose the ability to walk around age 12. Today, the average life expectancy for DMD patients hovers around 26.It was big news, then, when Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Sarepta Therapeutics announced in 2019 a breakthrough drug that directly targets the mutated gene responsible for DMD. The therapy uses antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO), a large synthetic molecule that permeates the cell nucleus in order to modify the dystrophin gene, allowing for production of a key protein that is normally missing in DMD patients.  But there s a problem with PMO by itself. It s not very good at entering cells,  says Carly Schissel, a PhD candidate in MIT s Department of Chemistry.To boost delivery to the nucleus, researchers can affix cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to the drug, thereby helping it cross the cell and nuclear membranes to reach its target. Which peptide sequence is best for the job, however, has remained a looming question.MIT researchers have now developed a systematic approach to solving this problem by combining experimental chemistry with artificial intelligence to discover nontoxic, highly-active peptides that can be attached to PMO to aid delivery. By developing these novel sequences, they hope to rapidly accelerate the development of gene therapies for DMD and other diseases.Results of their study have now been published in the journal Nature Chemistry in a paper led by Schissel and Somesh Mohapatra, a PhD student in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who are the lead authors.

These viruses can spread between birds, and sometimes even humans, and evolve rapidly.H5N6, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, has been on scientists  radar since 2014. There are several  clades,  or genetically distinct strains, of H5N6. Clade 2.3.4.4 is currently circulating in East Asia and has caused outbreaks in Europe, Africa, North America, and other parts of Asia. Assistant professor of pathobiology in the College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources, Dong-Hun Lee recently published a paper in Viruses demonstrating the transmissibility of clade 2.3.4.4 in domestic pigeons and mandarin ducks. This paper is the first to study this clade in these two birds. Wild waterfowl like Mandarin ducks are natural hosts for avian influenza viruses. Terrestrial birds like pigeons often interact with waterfowl, making them an important bridge species that could pass a virus onto poultry. Since the H5 virus lineage was first identified in 1996, it has caused severe economic losses for the global poultry industry and poses a severe public health threat. In 2015, an H5 outbreak caused $3.3 billion in losses to the U.S. poultry industry. Since 2003, 862 people have been infected with this virus in 17 countries, with a 53% fatality rate. These infections come from direct, unprotected contact with infected birds. There is no evidence this virus can be passed between humans.  It s a very dangerous virus in birds and in people, too,  Lee says. Lee and his collaborators focused on two of the six novel genotypes in clade 2.3.4.4: C1 and C4. C1 was the first genotype to emerge in wild birds in Korea, while C4 became the most prevalent during epidemics in Korea where the study took place. The researchers studied the infectivity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of both genotypes. After testing the birds to ensure none of them already had antibodies or antigens for the virus, Lee s team infected a portion of the Mandarin ducks with C1 and C4 and a portion of the pigeons with C1. The researchers were interested in determining if the C1 and C4 genotypes differed in wild waterfowl, since those birds are a natural reservoir species for the virus. They tested the transmissibility of viruses by placing uninfected birds in the same cage with infected birds. They also placed infected birds in one cage with natural air flow and into another cage filled with uninfected birds to test for indirect contact. They did not find significant differences between C1 and C4. Both successfully replicated in the birds and were found to be transmissible through direct and indirect exposure. They found that there was a higher level of viral shedding from mandarin ducks than pigeons.  As we expected, we found more replication and higher titers of virus shedding in mandarin ducks than in domestic pigeons without any clinical signs, because they re a natural reservoir species,  Lee says. This finding suggests that the virus can transfer between different bird species, adapt, and successfully replicate itself in its new host.  When a virus jumps from one host to another, it needs to adapt to that new host,  Lee says. None of the birds in the study exhibited clinical symptoms of the disease meaning, they were asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Infected birds often die within a week of contracting the illness. Given these findings and the danger clade 2.3.4.4 poses to the poultry industry and human health, Lee recommends enhancing surveillance of migratory and terrestrial wild birds to closely monitor the evolution and spread of this virus.  Considering the possibility of potential dispersal and maintenance of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses through these wild bird species, enhanced active surveillance in both migratory and terrestrial wild birds should be implemented,  Lee says.ReferenceJeong S, Kwon J-H, Lee S-H, et al.

Amid these glaring threats, the slow but rising creep of air and water pollution that humans encounter and even ingest may be easy to overlook, but research continues to reveal new data proving these exposures do impact human health.In Biophysics Reviews, from AIP Publishing, researchers from the Technical University of Munich review recent scientific literature about the effects of particle contaminants on the mucosal system, an internal membrane that serves as the body s lubricant and the first line of defense from infections and toxins. These data establish a clear link between exposure to airborne or waterborne particulate matter and several health conditions.  Mucosal barriers are really important to protect various body systems, but that mucosal function is only there if we don t damage it,  said co-author Oliver Lieleg.  Sadly, our native mucosal systems are being compromised by micro- and nanoparticles present in our environment.  Pollution in the air and water has four major effects on the mucosal system. Structural changes can create holes, making the mucosal barrier leaky. Pathogens and toxins can piggyback on the particles and enter the body. Cells can produce too much or too little mucus, and neither is good for preserving optimal function (e.g., when lubricating the eye to protect from abrasion upon blinking). Finally, the quality (e.g., stiffness) of the mucus itself can become altered.  Mucus is a complex mixture of components, and keeping the composition right is important,  said Lieleg.  Imagine if you add too much flour to the recipe when making a dough. The bread would come out hard and brittle. Contaminating mucus with black carbon or microplastic has similar negative effects and can alter mucus structure and function.  Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, and human activities can both result in problematic particles and produce air contaminants, like soot, and water contaminants, like the microplastics that are ubiquitous in waterways worldwide. Simply breathing, eating, and drinking exposes the body to these contaminants. Some food sources, like honey, may even be surprising in their potential to be tainted, and the effects from these foods could be underestimated. Recent research on humans and animals demonstrates exposure to particulate matter is often correlated with the development or progression of respiratory and heart diseases as well as various types of cancer, and impaired embryonic development. The mechanisms by which these occur are still largely uncertain, but the effects of particle exposure on mucosal structure and function are likely contributors to various negative health outcomes.  This is a topic we have to deal with and soon. That is clear as of today,  said Lieleg.  Still, we need more research to better understand which particles pose a threat and why. Those further insights are needed, so we can figure out how best to mitigate these effects. ReferenceMarczynski M, Lieleg O.

As a result, the newly evolved  superbugs  have put a large strain on health-care systems globally, says Zarifi.This newly developed sensor aims to combat the drawbacks of the current Antibiotic Susceptibility Test (AST), as it reduces the time and cost taken to conduct the test, while increasing the portability for AST to be used in remote regions. Many types of bacteria are continuously evolving to develop resistance to antibiotics. This is a pressing issue for hospitals around the globe, while sensor and diagnosis technology has been slow to adapt,  explains Zarifi, who teaches at the School of Engineering.Existing AST practices are expensive and can take up to 48 hours to process results. Longer wait times can significantly delay the treatments patients receive, which can lead to further medical complications or even fatalities. This method showcases the requirement for a reliable, rapid and cost-effective detection tool,  he says.The new sensor, developed by the UBC team, can differentiate bacterial growth variations before any visible cues are evident. Therefore, the dosage or type of antibiotics can be fine-tuned to combat the specific bacterial infection.In the next phase of development, the OMEGA lab aims to integrate artificial intelligence algorithms with this sensing device to develop smart sensors, which would be a big leap towards personalized antibiotic therapy.  Our ultimate goal is to reduce inappropriate usage of antibiotics and enhance quality of care for the patients,  says Zarifi.  The more quality tools like this that health-care practitioners have at their disposal, the greater their ability to combat bacteria and viruses.

Published August 10, 2021, in JAMA, the study analyzed dietary intake from 33,795 children and adolescents nationwide. Some whole grain breads and dairy foods are ultraprocessed, and they re healthier than other ultraprocessed foods. Processing can keep food fresher longer, allows for food fortification and enrichment, and enhances consumer convenience,  said senior and corresponding author Fang Fang Zhang, nutrition epidemiologist at the Friedman School.  But many ultraprocessed foods are less healthy, with more sugar and salt, and less fiber, than unprocessed and minimally processed foods, and the increase in their consumption by children and teenagers is concerning. The largest spike in calories came from such ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat dishes as takeout and frozen pizza and burgers: from 2.2% to 11.2% of calories. The second largest spike in calories came from packaged sweet snacks and desserts, the consumption of which grew from 10.6% to 12.9%.There was a larger increase in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods among non-Hispanic Blacks (10.3%) and Mexican Americans (7.6%) than non-Hispanic Whites (5.2%). Trends in other racial/ethnic groups were not assessed due to lack of sufficient data that allow for nationally representative estimates across survey cycles.There were no statistically significant differences in the overall findings by parental education and family income.  The lack of disparities based on parental education and family income indicates that ultraprocessed foods are pervasive in children s diets,  said Zhang.  This finding supports the need for researchers to track trends in food consumption more fully, taking into account consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Over the study period, calories from often healthier unprocessed or minimally processed foods decreased from 28.8% to 23.5%. The remaining percentage of calories came from moderately processed foods such as cheese and canned fruits and vegetables, and consumer-added flavor enhancers such as sugar, honey, maple syrup, and butter.There was good news: Calories from sugar-sweetened beverages dropped from 10.8% to 5.3% of overall calories, a 51% drop. This finding shows the benefits of the concerted campaign over the past few years to reduce overall consumption of sugary drinks,  said Zhang.  We need to mobilize the same energy and level of commitment when it comes to other unhealthy ultraprocessed foods such as cakes, cookies, doughnuts and brownies. In additional analyses, we compared the composition of ultraprocessed foods to non-ultra processed foods using data from the 2017-2018 period. We found that ultraprocessed foods contain a substantially higher percent of calories from carbohydrates and added sugars, and higher levels of sodium, but also had less fiber and a lower percentage of calories from protein,  said the study s first author, Lu Wang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Friedman School. Food processing is an often-overlooked dimension in nutrition research. We may need to consider that ultraprocessing of some foods may be associated with health risks, independent of the poor nutrient profile of ultraprocessed foods generally,  concluded Zhang.","Published: August 11, 2021"

Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered that there are three different subtypes of mature fat cells in white adipose tissue and that it is only one of these, called AdipoPLIN, that responds to insulin. The findings may be relevant for future treatments of metabolic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes. These findings increase our knowledge about the function of fat tissue,  says co-corresponding author Niklas Mejhert, researcher at the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, at Karolinska Institutet.  They show that the overall capacity of fat tissue to respond to insulin is determined by the proportion and function of a specific fat cell subtype. This could have implications for diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. In the study, which is published in the journal Cell Metabolism, the researchers identified 18 cell classes that forms clusters in white adipose tissue in humans. Of these, three constituted mature fat cells with distinct phenotypes.To test if the fat cell subtypes were linked to any specific function, the researchers examined in part how these subtypes in four people reacted to short-term increases in insulin levels. The result showed that insulin activated the gene expression in the subtype AdipoPLIN but did not materially affect the other two subtypes. Additionally, the response to insulin stimulation was proportional to the individual s whole-body insulin sensitivity. Our findings challenge the current view of insulin resistance as a generally reduced response to insulin in the fat cells,  says Mikael Ryd n, professor in the same department and another of the study s co-corresponding authors.  Instead, our study suggests that insulin resistance, and possibly type 2 diabetes, could be due to changes in a specific subtype of fat cells. This shows that fat tissue is a much more complex tissue than previously thought. Like muscle tissue, people have several types of fat cells with different functions, which opens up for future interventions targeted at different fat cell types. In the study, the Ryd n and Mejhert group used a special technique called spatial transcriptomics, which was developed by among others collaboration partner Patrik St hl, associate professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and SciLifeLab. Spatial transcriptomics generates information about tissue organization via microscopy and gene expression via RNA sequencing. This study is unique in that it is the first time we ve applied spatial transcriptomics to fat tissue, which has a special set of characteristics and composition,  says Patrik St hl, the study s third corresponding author.  We are very happy that the technology continues to contribute to solving biologically complex questions in an increasing number of research areas. Reference: B ckdahl J, Franz n L, Massier L, et al.

An ANN is a computing system consisting of multiple input and output units, much like the biological brain. A team of researchers from The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) and the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute trained the ANN to perform a cognitive memory task and observed how it worked to complete the assignment.This is a unique approach in two ways. Previous work on brain connectivity, also known as connectomics, focused on describing brain organization, without looking at how it actually performs computations and functions. Secondly, traditional ANNs have arbitrary structures that do not reflect how real brain networks are organized. By integrating brain connectomics into the construction of ANN architectures, researchers hoped to both learn how the wiring of the brain supports specific cognitive skills, and to derive novel design principles for artificial networks.They found that ANNs with human brain connectivity, known as neuromorphic neural networks, performed cognitive memory tasks more flexibly and efficiently than other benchmark architectures. The neuromorphic neural networks were able to use the same underlying architecture to support a wide range of learning capacities across multiple contexts. The project unifies two vibrant and fast-paced scientific disciplines,  says Bratislav Misic, a researcher at The Neuro and the paper s senior author.  Neuroscience and AI share common roots, but have recently diverged. Using artificial networks will help us to understand how brain structure supports brain function. In turn, using empirical data to make neural networks will reveal design principles for building better AI. So, the two will help inform each other and enrich our understanding of the brain.

The impact of this alteration in fight-or-flight response, especially if prolonged, means that many processes within the body could be disrupted or affected. This research team has specifically been looking at the impact on the cardiovascular system   including blood pressure and blood flow   but the sympathetic nervous system is also important in exercise responses, the digestive system, the immune function, and more.Understanding what happens in the body shortly following diagnosis of COVID-19 is an important first step towards understanding the potential long-term consequences of contracting the disease.Importantly, if similar disruption of the flight-or-fight response, like that found here in young individuals, is present in older adults following COVID-19 infection, there may be substantial adverse implications for cardiovascular health.The researchers studied lung function, exercise capacity, vascular function, and neural cardiovascular control (the control of heartbeat by the brain).They used a technique called microneurography, wherein the researchers inserted a tiny needle with an electrode into a nerve behind the knee, which records the electrical impulses of that nerve and measures how many bursts of electrical activity are happening and how big the bursts are.From this nerve activity, they can assess the function of the sympathetic nervous system through a series of tests. For all the tests, the subject was lying on their back on a bed. First, the researchers looked at the baseline resting activity of the nerves, heart rate, and blood pressure. Resting sympathetic nerve activity was higher in the COVID-19 participants than healthy people used as controls in the experiment.Then, the subject did a  cold pressor test,  where they stick their hand in an ice-water mixture (~0  C) for two minutes. In healthy individuals, this causes a profound increase in that sympathetic nerve (fight-or-flight) activity and blood pressure. The COVID-19 subjects  rated their pain substantially lower than healthy subjects typically do.Finally, the participant was moved to an upright position (the bed they re lying on can tilt up and down) to see how well their body can respond to a change in position. The COVID-19 subjects had a pretty large increase in heart rate during this test; they also had higher sympathetic nerve activity throughout the tilt test compared with other healthy young adults.As with all research on humans, there are limitations to this study. However, the biggest limitation in the present study is its cross-sectional nature   in other words, we do not know what the COVID-19 subjects  nervous system activity  looked like  before they were diagnosed with COVID-19.These findings are consistent with the increasing reports of long-COVID symptoms pertaining to problems with the fight-or-flight response.Abigail Stickford, senior author on this study said,  Through our collaborative project, we have been following this cohort of COVID-19 subjects for 6 months following their positive test results. This work was representative of short-term data, so the next steps for us are to wrap up data collection and interpret how the subjects have changed over this time.

Now a Northwestern University study finds that touch-sensitive neurons communicate touch in a much messier and jumbled manner.In the study, the team developed a new technique to stimulate rats  whiskers in three dimensions while simultaneously recording first-stage touch-sensitive neurons in the rats  brains. The researchers discovered that, instead of responding to distinct types of touch, these neurons   which are the first to receive early touch signals   responded to many types of touch and to varying degrees.The research was published online todayin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Many people used to think that each neuron was very precisely tuned for some aspect of the touch stimulus,  said Northwestern s Mitra Hartmann, one of the study s senior authors.  We didn t find that at all. Some neurons respond more than others to some features of the stimulus, so there is some degree of tuning. But these neurons respond to many combinations of different forces and torques applied to the whisker. When we compared all the recorded neurons, we found that the stimuli they responded to overlapped with each other but not perfectly,  added Nicholas Bush, the paper s first author.  It s similar to a painter s palette: We expected to find a handful of  primary colors,  where a neuron could be one of a few different types. But we found the  palette  had already been mixed. Each neuron was a little different from all the others, but together they covered an entire spectrum.

When these exercises are combined with aerobic activities, the benefit is even greater, potentially reducing mortality by 28%. Physical activity has been associated with a reduced risk of several types of cancer, but it was unclear what kinds of exercise had the best results. In our study, we found evidence that muscle strength training can not only reduce cancer incidence and mortality but also have an even better effect when associated with aerobic activities, such as walking, running, swimming and cycling,  Leandro Rezende, a professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Federal University of S o Paulo s Medical School (EPM-UNIFESP) in Brazil, told Ag ncia FAPESP.Rezende is last author of the meta-analysis, published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity.FAPESP supported the study by awarding a scientific initiation scholarship to co-author Wilson Nascimento, who collaborated with researchers at the University of Harvard, Spain s International University of Valencia (VIU) and Public University of Navarre (UPNA), and Chile s University of Santiago. Epidemiological research using demographic data has shown that physical activity in general reduces the risk of breast, endometrial, stomach, throat, kidney and bladder cancer. The EPM-UNIFESP study found that muscle strengthening exercises can reduce the risk of kidney cancer by 26%. Statistically significant correlations were not found between muscle strengthening exercises and tumors primarily located in the colon, prostate, lung, pancreas, bladder, esophagus and rectum, as well as melanoma, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia and cancers of the digestive system, owing to the limited number of studies.

The expedition, which covered 5,310 square miles, explored nine deep sea sites, including the offshore site where possibly hundreds of thousands of barrels of toxic waste from the production of the insecticide DDT were dumped from 1947 to 1982. With an underwater robot, the team of scientists from UC San Diego s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the United States Geological Survey collected sediment and biological samples around six barrels to understand potential ecological effects of the dump site and to determine the levels of DDT present in the ecosystem after more than 50 years. The site had been surveyed previously by scientists from UC Santa Barbara and Scripps on previous expeditions. The goal of the Schmidt Ocean Institute expedition was to establish mineral and biological baselines in the area known as the southern California Borderland, which contains marine mineral types that have mineral resource potential in other regions of the global oceans and can be used for comparison. The area contains rare earth marine minerals such as ferromanganese crusts and phosphorite that contain minerals and metals used in the manufacture of electronics, electric car batteries, solar panels, and other green technologies. Scientists collected more than 300 samples of seafloor rocks, sediment, seawater, and marine invertebrates to better understand the ecology, mineral and microbial makeup of the relatively unexplored deep-sea system. In collecting samples, researchers also hope to evaluate the therapeutic or drug discovery potential of deep-sea microbes found in mineral-rich areas.   We are just beginning to understand the valuable resources of our ocean ecosystem,  said Wendy Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Ocean Institute.  We can t protect what we don t know and understand, and the human impact on our ocean over the past 75 years has had a detrimental effect on its health and on the many ocean systems that support life on land. We expect the knowledge gained from this expedition will inform policy, management and stewardship of the deep sea, so that episodes of dumping toxic waste, such as this one, will not happen again  The 12 expedition dives were broadcast live to the public on Schmidt Ocean Institute s social media channels. During one of the dives to explore the DDT site, scientists discovered a whale fall the seafloor location where the remains of a whale come to rest. Scientists also identified a new area of methane seepage. Marine biologists consider both areas a focus of specialized research because of the unique habitat they create.  Establishing ecological baselines in the deep sea allows us to track changes over time  and better understand  the consequences of human actions,  said Chief Scientist Dr. Lisa Levin, a professor of biological oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The  DDT dump site provides evidence of a large human footprint in the deep ocean, but we are just starting to identify the effects on local marine communities.  The information the team collected at the DDT barrel disposal site will be compared to animals and microbes at more distant sites in order to assess the current concentrations and effects of DDT in the region. The samples will return to Scripps Institution of Oceanography where scientists will conduct further analysis and DNA sequencing. This article has been republished from the following materials.

The Earth s tectonic plates, however, hide subtle warnings that a major fault may soon break. Like forecasting a thunderstorm, knowing how to read the warnings could help communities protect lives, infrastructure and local economies.For decades, scientists have struggled to reliably give forecasts for major earthquake hotspots, but now an international team of scientists led by The University of Texas at Austin has embarked on a new initiative to do just that. Physics-based forecasting is what we're trying to achieve,  said project lead Thorsten Becker, a professor at UT s Jackson School of Geosciences.The five-year project, funded by the National Science Foundation, will develop new computing tools, software and instructional material focused on forecast modeling. The team will also train students, hold workshops and recruit new computational geoscientists by drawing on overlooked talent pools and reaching out to underserved communities.The ultimate goal: computer models that can forecast the chances of an earthquake happening and its likely impact, similar to those used to predict the weather but on longer timescales. Reviewers and the NSF Frontier Research in the Earth Sciences program are genuinely excited about the potential of a physics-based model of megathrusts, and the prospect of predictive models,  said Dennis Geist, program director in the Division of Earth Sciences at the NSF.Becker doesn t expect to see earthquake  weather  forecasts within five years, but he believes the idea is now technically possible. The bulk of what remains is figuring out the physics governing earthquakes and their inherent uncertainties: key ingredients in the forecasting process. At UT we have the benefit of having great people already working on different parts of the problem,  he said. Becker is joined on the project by scientists at the Jackson School, its Institute for Geophysics, UT s Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, and supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).The UT scientists will team up with researchers at universities and national labs working on three of the world s earthquake hotspots: the U.S. Pacific Northwest, New Zealand and Japan. One of those researchers is project co-lead Alice Gabriel, an earthquake physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and LMU Munich, Germany. According to Gabriel, physics is key to solving the earthquake riddle. By taking a physics-based approach, we can home in on the conditions that matter for the earthquake cycle and find optimal locations to place new sensors,  she said.The sites selected are all subduction zones   places where tectonic plates meet. The differences between them will allow researchers to test their models and figure out what conditions to look for when deciding whether an earthquake is likely.Subduction zones are important because they are the sites of the world s most powerful earthquakes and can trigger dangerous tsunamis, such as the one following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake that killed almost a quarter of a million people in 14 countries.They are a challenge to study, however, because they are usually situated offshore and driven by deep geologic forces that take hundreds to millions of years to unfold, at scales from fractions of an inch to thousands of miles. That s why earthquake scientists turn to computers to simulate faults and their tectonic settings. The new project will look for gaps in the physics and figure out what needs to be measured to make the simulations more useful to forecasters. It s a little bit like calculating the probability of a pandemic,  said Laura Wallace, a research scientist at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, who is based in New Zealand.  You can t know when and where the next one will happen but you can look at factors that make it more likely and model how it might unfold. Simulating events in the natural world has great potential but requires understanding of both geoscience and computing, a combination that remains in short supply. That s why a large portion of the project s resources is assigned to training a new generation of students that will benefit not just the project but the geosciences as a whole.To do that, Dana Thomas, a Jackson School outreach coordinator and one of the project s co-leaders, is designing education programs to show students from other fields how their skills can be used to answer questions about the way the Earth works. Students shouldn t think they need to put on a backpack to study our Earth,  Thomas said.  We can reach so many more potential computational geoscientists by drawing on talent from math, physics and other allied STEM fields, and reaching out to underserved communities. Thomas s plans include a bridge program for incoming college freshmen, paid summer research opportunities for talented undergraduates at historically Black colleges and universities, such as Fort Valley State University, and a summer school with TACC that will train students to use Frontera, the world s most powerful university-based supercomputer. The programs fit together in a freshman-to-grad-school pipeline: it s a model Thomas hopes will be replicated up and down the country.This article has been republished from the following materials.

What is new, however, is that metals can also be transported in this manner. In addition, the smaller the particles, the greater the metal accumulation on the plastic. This has been demonstrated by scientists at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon in a new study. The results were published now in the Journal of Hazardous Materials Letters.Scientists worldwide have already demonstrated the alarming ecological ubiquity and longevity of plastic particles. The particles measure between one micrometer and a half centimeter in size. They develop in part when larger plastic components break apart in the sea or wind up in the rivers and subsequently in the ocean directly from wastewater stemming from land. Microplastics are toxic in very high concentrations. In addition, they can also accumulate, transport and release other pollutants. While data has already been published on organic pollutants in this context, there is little known about the interactions between the microplastic particles floating in the water and dissolved metals. This is why scientists from the Institute of Coastal Environmental Chemistry at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon have now systematically studied these interactions in the laboratory. The team, which includes first author Dr. Lars Hildebrandt, studied the accumulation of fifty-five different metals and semi-metals on polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate particles, measuring 63 to 250 micrometers in size.  In regard to water polluted by plastics, the two types of plastics we studied play a vital role,  says environmental chemist Hildebrandt.  This is due to their wide range of application and the associated high production volumes. Most shopping bags, for example, are made of polyethylene (recycling code 4, LDPE), and plastic drinking bottles are almost without exception made of polyethylene terephthalate (recycling code 1, PET). In the study, we determined that the accumulation becomes stronger when the particles become smaller and that there are significant differences between the various elements (metals and semi-metals) in terms of the extent of enrichment,  says coauthor Dr. Daniel Pr frock, department head of Inorganic Environmental Chemistry at Hereon. Some metals, or more precisely their ions, such as chromium, iron, tin and the rare earths attached themselves almost entirely to the microplastics. Others, such as cadmium, zinc and cooper, showed almost no accumulation on the plastic over the entire test period. In addition, the polyethylene particles showed significantly greater accumulation than the polyethylene terephthalate particles.In the second phase of the test, the Hereon scientists could show that the particles loaded with metals or semi-metals almost completely released the respective metal contents again under chemical conditions, such as those that prevail in the digestive tract.  Our test set-up in the laboratory was actually simplified and without model organisms. Nonetheless, the results provide important evidence that microplastic particles, when absorbed by the body, act as a type of trojan horse for metals and that these metals can possibly be introduced into organisms to a greater extent in that way,  says Lars Heldebrandt, drawing his initial conclusion. Further studies are now being conducted to determine how other plastics frequently found in the environment behave and what influence the age of the particles and their weathering state have on the accumulation and release processes.ReferenceHildebrandt L et al.

The new study in The Lancet provides the most detailed observational study of such cases so far, in which 70 patients with VITT-associated CVT following vaccination are compared to 25 with CVT without evidence of VITT.The authors suggest that some treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin seem to be associated with better outcomes but caution against reading too much into the findings of the observational study, saying that reliable evidence about treatments can only be obtained in a randomised clinical trial.The NHS s success with the vaccination programme makes the UK a very good place to study rare side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination. The authors started collecting their cases within a few weeks of the discovery of this new condition and submitted their report within two months of it being reported in the medical literature.VITT-associated CVT has a very high mortality rate. Even without VITT, CVT is a very serious medical condition, with around 4% of patients dying during their hospital admission. In patients with VITT-associated CVT observed in this study, though, the mortality rate during admission was around seven times higher than that, at 29%.This poorer outcome is explained at least in part because the abnormal blockage of veins is much more extensive in this condition, with more veins blocked both in the head and elsewhere in the body.Lead author and NHNN consultant neurologist Dr Richard Perry said:  With an illness of such severity, often in young patients who were previously fit and well, doctors have been desperate for evidence regarding treatments that might prevent some of the death and disability that arises from this condition. While an observational study is not the ideal platform to provide evidence for which medications work, it may be a long time before we have evidence from randomised clinical trials, the gold standard for testing new treatments. For the moment we are dependent on observational studies like CAIAC for our evidence. The study provides support for the three principles of treatment established so far by the Expert Haematology Panel, based on early work at UCLH and two other European sites: 1. The use of non-heparin-based anticoagulation 2. Give treatments to try to reduce the level of the abnormal antibody that is implicated in this condition, and 3. Avoid the strategy of trying to bring the platelet count back up to normal levels by giving platelet transfusions. Christine Roffe, Professor of Stroke Medicine at Keele University, said Although there are sound theoretical reasons supporting the adoption of these treatment strategies, until now there has been no clinical evidence for their use. In our study, non-heparin blood thinners and intravenous immunoglobulin were both associated with better patient outcomes, providing the first clinical evidence from a large case series in support of these treatments. Alastair Webb, consultant neurologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford said:  We found that those patients who were given intravenous immunoglobulin   the treatment in which the body is flooded with normal antibodies to try to reduce the effects of the abnormal one   were more likely to leave hospital alive and able to live an independent life rather than depending on carers or family to look after them. Use of non-heparin blood thinners was similarly associated with a more favourable outcome. Our data does not prove that these treatments work, as the most severely affected patients may have been too unwell to receive them in time, but the results support their use whilst we seek better evidence,  he said.On the other hand, platelet transfusions were associated with a worse outcome in patients with VITT-associated CVT. Although observational data cannot prove harm from this treatment approach, the study provides support for the concern that has already been raised about the potential harm of platelet transfusions.Marie Scully, UCLH consultant haematologist and Professor of Haemostasis and Thrombosis at UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said:  Tempting though it might be to replace the platelets that are missing in this condition by infusing new platelets from blood donors, we do not advise this approach. However, it is difficult in cases requiring neurosurgical interventions and in such situations they are required to prevent bleeding.  Presumably, the reason why the numbers of platelets in the bloodstream is so low in VITT is because they are quickly used up by the abnormal clotting. Infusing more platelets may simply add more fuel to the fire. Reference: Perry RJ, Tamborska A, Singh B, et al.

And the closer the contact, the more antibiotic resistance they found.The research team, graduate student Sally Bornbusch and Christine Drea, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University, sampled the dung of ring-tailed lemurs and sequenced the genes of all microbes found there, looking for genetic markers of antibiotic resistance.The study compared 10 lemur populations: seven wild populations in Madagascar, two from research facilities --the Lemur Rescue Center in Madagascar and the Duke Lemur Center in the United States --and finally a group of lemurs kept as pets in Madagascar.In wild animals, the average proportion of resistance genes in the gut microbiomes was close to zero. But in animals from research facilities, that proportion was more than 25 times greater than in wild lemurs. In pet lemurs, the proportion was almost 35 times greater.Some of this is likely due to good veterinary care: lemurs living in research facilities are treated for infections when needed, and so have greater direct exposure to antibiotics than their wild cousins.However, pet lemurs that likely never receive veterinary care harbored the highest abundance of antibiotic resistance genes.Keeping a lemur as a pet is illegal in Madagascar, so those who keep lemurs are unlikely to take these animals to a veterinarian and risk facing legal consequences. These pet lemurs are therefore acquiring the antibiotic resistant microbes simply by sharing their environment with humans and domestic animals.Ring-tailed lemurs are omnivores and generalists who will eat dirt, excrement, and whatever they can get hold of. In a domestic household, they are often in constant contact with humans, perched on their owner s shoulders, or in the arms of tourists willing to pay for a photo (a practice that is harmful to both humans and animals).Bornbusch said that this physical and social environment is apparently contributing to pet lemurs  antibiotic resistance. Microbes are like an overlaying blanket on everything. They're not only in our guts, but also on our skin, our furniture, and in our food and water,  Bornbusch said.  They're everywhere, all the time, and they are easily transmitted between environments. Among wild lemurs, antibiotic resistance varied along a gradient of human activity. Animals from areas impacted by cattle grazing, farming, or tourism harbored more antibiotic resistant microbes than those from more pristine environments, but still far less than lemurs living in close proximity to humans. Antibiotic treatment is clearly not the only mechanism leading to a higher abundance of resistance genes in these animals,  Bornbusch said.In fact, even among lemurs housed at research facilities, those with no previous antibiotic treatment harbored similar numbers of antibiotic resistance genes compared to lemurs at the same facility that had been treated many times for infections.Proximity to humans also determined the type of resistance genes that were acquired. The microbiomes of ring-tailed lemurs from Madagascar showed signs of resistance to antibiotics used to combat outbreaks of plague, while lemurs from the Unites States showed resistance to antibiotics frequently prescribed in North America.Antibiotic resistance genes are nothing new. Microbes have been mutating and evolving resistance genes for millions of years in an arms race with naturally occurring antibiotics.In a natural scenario, this process rarely poses problems. But things started to go awry when humans harnessed the power of naturally occurring antibiotics and released man-made antibiotics to the public. Humans came along, developed antibiotics, spread them all around us, and propagated these resistance genes into natural environments and into the microbiomes of wildlife,  Bornbusch said. Though grim, these results can have a positive impact on conservation and wildlife management practices. Even if these results are slightly scary, they help us use microbiome science to hone veterinary practices and conservation activities,  Bornbusch said. She also said that more research is needed to better understand the impact of these resistance genes on wildlife. Right now, we know that these resistance genes are out there, but we don t know whether they are truly harmful to lemurs,  said Bornbusch.  These results give us a stepping-stone for research on the impact of these resistant microbes on wildlife and their environment. Reference: Bornbusch SL, Drea CM.

In 467 commercial beer types they found at least 7,700 different chemical formulas, which translates to tens of thousands of unique molecules. Beers brewed from barley plus either wheat, rice, or corn contain molecules that reliably indicate the original cereal. The analysis takes only 10 minutes to detect thousands of metabolites per beer, making it a powerful new method for quality control.The tradition of beer brewing dates back to at least 7000 BCE and maybe even to the invention of agriculture, considering that most cereals can spontaneously ferment if exposed to airborne yeasts. The code of the Babylonian king Hammurabi (rule 1792 to 1750 BCE), whose laws 108 through 111 regulate beer sales, shows that people have been anxious to safeguard the quality of beer through legislation for millennia. For example, the Bavarian  Reinheitsgebot  ( Purity Law ) of 1516, often considered the world s oldest still functional   with modifications   food regulation, allows only barley, water, and hops as ingredients for brewing beer (with confiscation of the barrels as penalty for transgression).Now, in a recent study in Frontiers in Chemistry, the science of beer is taken to a new level. Scientists from Germany use state-of-the-art analytical methods to reveal the metabolic complexity   tens of thousands of different molecules   of commercial beers from around the world. Beer is an example of enormous chemical complexity. And thanks to recent improvements in in analytical chemistry, comparable in power to the ongoing revolution in the technology of video displays with ever-increasing resolution, we can reveal this complexity in unprecedented detail. Today it s easy to trace tiny variations in chemistry throughout the food production process, to safeguard quality or to detect hidden adulterations,  said corresponding author Prof Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin, head of the Comprehensive Foodomics Platform at the Technical University of Munich and of the Analytical BioGeoChemistry research unit at the Helmholtz Center in Munich. Schmitt-Kopplin and colleagues used two powerful methods   direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (DI-FTICR MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ToF-MS)   to reveal the full range of metabolites in 467 types of beer brewed in the US, Latin America, Europe, Africa and East Asia. These included lagers, craft and abbey beers, top-fermented beers, and gueuzes brewed from barley as the only source of starch for fermentation, or barley plus either wheat, rice, and corn (maize). The methods have complementary strengths. DI-FTICR-MS directly revealed the chemical diversity across all beers and predicted chemical formulas for the metabolite ions in them. The authors then used UPLC-ToF-MS on a subset of 100 beers to analyze the results with resolution on the possible isomers. UPLC-ToF-MS uses chromatography to first separate ions with identical masses and fragmentation of the mass ions to daughter ions, making it possible to predict the exact molecular structure. The authors placed these metabolites in relation within the  chemical space , each linked to one or more others through a single reaction, for example the addition of a methoxy-, hydroxyl-, sulfate-, or sugar-group to the molecular backbone, or turning an unsaturated bond into a saturated bond. This yielded a reconstruction of a metabolite network leading to the final product, consisting of nearly a hundred steps with a starting point in molecules from the original cereals, synthetized from the amino acid tryptophan. Derived from these are secondary metabolites, unique to each cereal. Our mass spectrometry method, which takes only 10 minutes per sample, should be very powerful for quality control in food industry and set the basis of novel molecular markers and non-targeted metabolite profiles needed in foodstuff inspection,  said Schmitt-Kopplin. The authors found approximately 7700 ions with unique masses and formulas, including lipids, peptides, nucleotides, phenolics, organic acids, phosphates, and carbohydrates, of which around 80% aren t yet described in chemical databases. Because each formula may in some cases cover up to 25 different molecular structures, this translates into tens of thousands of unique metabolites.  Here we reveal an enormous chemical diversity across beers, with tens of thousands of unique molecules. We show that this diversity originates in the variety of raw materials, processing, and fermentation. The molecular complexity is then amplified by the so-called  Maillard reaction  between amino acids and sugars which also gives bread, meat steaks, and toasted marshmallow their  roasty  flavor. This complex reaction network is an exciting focus of our research, given its importance for food quality, flavor, and also the development of novel bioactive molecules of interest for health,  concluded first author Stefan Pieczonka, a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich.ReferencePieczonka SA, Paravicini S, Rychlik M, Schmitt-Kopplin P.

The proposed solution lies in the joint layer-by-layer electrochemical deposition of palladium and silver on the surface of the electrode (test strip). The co-authors published an article about the work in the Russian Chemical Bulletin. This is the first description in the scientific literature of the method of layer-by-layer deposition of palladium and silver.""We used a printed electrode for deposition - a miniature substrate with a suspension of multi-walled, that is, carbon nanotubes embedded in each other. Water from the suspension applied to the electrode evaporates, and the nanotubes remain on the electrode, thus increasing its specific surface area. Then we deposited first silver and then palladium on the modified electrode surface several times alternately,"" says Andrei Okhokhonin, associate professor of analytical chemistry at Ural Federal University and head of the research group.The authors suggested an innovative method of layer-by-layer deposition of silver and palladium. The electrode is dipped alternately in solutions of silver salt AgNO3 and palladium salt K2PdCl4 in dilute sulfuric acid. In this form, the silver and palladium lack one and two electrons, respectively, before they become insoluble metal state. By placing the electrode in the solution, an electric current is applied to it. The current reduces the metals, and this leads to the formation of solid particles on the surface of the electrode. The operation is repeated four times.""Such a technique has not yet been used, it proved to be effective. The new material has significant catalytic activity in the electrochemical oxidation of glucose. Moreover, unlike analogues, the oxidation reaction efficiently proceeds in neutral phosphate buffer solution medium, which corresponds to the acidity of human blood. Other similar systems are either markedly less sensitive to glucose or work in an alkaline environment and involve an additional step of blood sample dilution, in certain cases by a thousand times. All this complicates procedures and reduces the reliability of analysis results,"" emphasizes Andrei Okhokhonin.According to the developers, the unique characteristics of the obtained system open up broad prospects for its practical application in creating an enzyme-free electrocatalytic sensor for determining glucose in whole blood. The research was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (Project   20-13-00142).Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels plays a key role in modern therapy of diabetes, one of the most widespread diseases of mankind. Blood glucose concentration analysis using glucose meters uses complex protein compounds - glucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase enzymes, which are produced by microorganisms. The enzymes are attached to the sensitive part of the test strip (sensor), where a drop of blood is fed. As biological catalysts, the enzymes enable the glucose oxidation reaction, and the glucometer records the reaction and converts the result into a numerical value. A blood glucose level of 5.5-6.5 mmol/l is normal for adults.Enzyme-based test systems are widespread, but have a number of drawbacks. Because enzymes are protein-based and degrade under heat or light exposure, their lifespan is limited. Therefore, enzyme production by microorganisms is a constantly reproducible and expensive process. This affects the cost and availability of sensors. The solution to the problem of making them cheaper is to use more stable and cheaper oxidation catalysts of synthetic rather than enzymatic origin instead of enzymes.As such, science considers, in particular, palladium nanoparticles, a metal from the noble group.The advantages of palladium nanoparticles include the necessary stability and increased sensitivity to glucose. At the same time, they exhibit significant catalytic activity only when pretreated in a saturated alkaline solution, which is then fed a blood sample. This complicates and slows down the analysis procedure. To date, only one method of direct blood analysis using enzyme-free catalysts based on palladium nanoparticles and in a neutral environment, the composition of which is close to the physiological properties of blood, has been developed. However, the low concentration of nanoparticles on the electrode surface does not provide the required sensitivity of the system and hence the accuracy of the analysis results.It is known that the catalytic activity of palladium is enhanced in combination with silver: the two elements coated on the electrode part of the test strip improve the catalytic properties of each other, which increases the sensitivity of blood glucose analysis. But the existing technologies of creating such compounds do not allow complete control over the processes.Thus, an urgent task is to synthesize enzyme-free catalysts for more accurate and cheaper determination of blood glucose concentration.Reference: Okhokhonin AV, Tokmakova KO, Svalova TS, Matern AI, Kozitsina AN.

City of Hope s findings, published in JAMA Network Open today, are important because immunotherapy traditionally has been seen as ineffective against microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, which represents 95% of all metastatic colorectal cancer cases. These patients have few treatment options once they become resistant to chemotherapy.The retrospective study included 95 City of Hope patients with MSS metastatic colorectal cancer who received immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapy once their disease became resistant to chemotherapy. The median time of disease progression for patients who did not have liver metastases was four months compared to one and a half months for those whose cancer had spread to the liver. When we stratified the patients by the presence or absence of liver metastases, we noted that about 20% of patients without liver metastases had a major response to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, while none of the patients with liver metastases experienced a positive response,  said Marwan Fakih, M.D., co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program and the Judy & Bernard Briskin Distinguished Director of Clinical Research at City of Hope.  Colorectal cancer patients without liver metastases could benefit from immunotherapy considerably more than patients with liver metastases. When colorectal cancer spreads to the liver, some patients can undergo surgery to remove all tumors; however, sometimes these tumors cannot be removed surgically. That s when chemotherapy is used, but  chemotherapy is destined to stop working, and we have to look into additional treatment options,  Fakih said, adding,  To our knowledge, this is the largest study to evaluate the impact of PD-1/PD-L1 targeting on patient response as stratified by site of metastatic disease. The clinical significance, Fakih said, is that advanced colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases should not be considered for PD-1/PD-L1-based therapy. Instead, other novel investigational strategies are recommended. For patients without liver metastatic disease, PD-1/PD-L1-based therapies, particularly those combining these agents with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), hold significant promise,  he said, noting that TKIs that target the tumor vasculature modify the tumor environment and make it more responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.Reference: Wang C, Sandhu J, Ouyang C, Ye J, Lee PP, Fakih M.

The study by William Hallman, a professor who chairs the Department of Human Ecology in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University New Brunswick, confirmed the results from his earlier study comparing seven potential names for these products.In the new study, a representative sample of 1,200 consumers evaluated packages of Atlantic salmon designed to mimic those found in grocery stores, labeled with  cell-based seafood  or  cell-cultured seafood .The names were evaluated using five criteria to test their ability to meet FDA labeling regulations and producers  needs to sell their products. These criteria included each term's ability to help consumers distinguish cell-cultured seafood from wild and farmed fish; to signal its potential as an allergen; to be seen as an appropriate term for the product; to not disparage cell-cultured or conventional products; and to not evoke thoughts, images or emotions that the products aren t safe, healthy, and nutritious. The results suggest that both  cell-based seafood  and  cell-cultured seafood  meet FDA regulations,  Hallman said.  They help the majority of consumers understand that the new products are produced in a different way from the  wild-caught  and  farm-raised  fish they may already be buying. At the same time, consumers also recognized that if they are allergic to seafood, they shouldn t eat the product. The study s participants reported slightly more positive overall impressions, slightly greater interest in tasting and slightly greater likelihood of purchasing the products labeled as  cell-based seafood  than those labeled as  cell-cultured seafood. Citing Hallman s research, the National Fisheries Institute (representing the fisheries industry), the Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Alliance for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation (representing the cell-cultured protein industry) have begun to coalesce around use of the term  cell-cultured. Both names work well,  Hallman said.  The key is to choose a single term and to get everyone to adopt it. That will reduce confusion and ultimately help consumers understand what they are buying. The new products are produced using the same muscle cells, fat cells and connective tissue cells from fish species and are expected to look, taste and have the same nutritional qualities and health benefits as conventional seafood. These new products will be produced in sterile environments, so they will not contain mercury, pesticides, microplastics, antibiotics and other contaminants. Additionally, companies will only produce the parts of the fish that consumers eat, resulting in less food waste, while providing year-round availability, consistent quality and sustainable production practices.The study was supported by BlueNalu, a San Diego company led by Lou Cooperhouse, former director of Rutgers Food Innovation Center.

Over time, this imbalance can play a significant role in causing certain illnesses, including cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurological diseases, as well as cancer,  said the study s senior author, Dr. Holly Middlekauff, a professor of cardiology and physiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.E-cigarettes, devices that deliver nicotine with flavoring and other chemicals in a vapor rather than smoke, are seen by many as a safer alternative to regular cigarettes, but research by Middlekauff and others has demonstrated that vaping is associated with a number of adverse changes in the body that can presage future health problems. For the current study, 32 male and female study participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 33, were divided into three groups: 11 nonsmokers, nine regular tobacco cigarette smokers and 12 regular e-cigarette smokers. Middlekauff and her colleagues collected immune cells from each individual before and after a half-hour vaping session to measure and compare changes in oxidative stress among the groups.The researchers performed the same process during a control session in which participants spent 30 minutes  sham-vaping,  or puffing on an empty straw.They found that in nonsmokers, oxidative stress levels were two to four times higher after the vaping session than before. The same 30-minute exposure did not lead to an increase in oxidative stress among the regular cigarette and e-cigarette smokers, the researchers noted, most likely because their baseline levels of oxidative stress were already elevated. We were surprised by the gravity of the effect that one vaping session can have on healthy young people,  Middlekauff said.  This brief vaping session was not dissimilar to what they may experience at a party, yet the effects were dramatic. The results are especially troubling, the researchers say, because the popularity of vaping continues to increase, particularly among teens and young adults. According to a 2020 study, nearly 1 in 3 high school students reported that they had used an e-cigarette during the previous month.There is still more to be understood about what exactly causes the changes in oxidative stress levels   whether it is the nicotine or non-nicotine elements in e-cigarettes   the researchers say. Middlekauff and her team will continue to explore this question in future research. While there s a perception that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes, these findings show clearly and definitively that there is no safe level of vaping,  Middlekauff said.  The results are clear, unambiguous and concerning.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/dopamine-discovery-cracks-the-code-of-motivation-351811,Dopamine Discovery Cracks the Code of Motivation By manipulating the dopamine receptors of monkeys and studying their behavior  scientists have revealed how our brains make us feel motivated  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Why do we do things? What persuades us to put an effort to achieve goals, however mundane? What, for instance, drives us to search for food? Neurologically, the answer is hidden in the reward system of the brain an evolutionary mechanism that controls our willingness to work or to take a risk as the cost of achieving our goals and enjoying the perceived rewards. In people suffering from depression, schizophrenia, or Parkinson's disease, often the reward system of the brain is impaired, leading them to a state of diminished motivation for work or chronic fatigue.To find a way to overcome the debilitating behavioral blocks, neuroscientists are investigating the  anatomy  of the reward system and determining how it evaluates the cost-benefit trade-off while deciding on whether to pursue a task. Recently, Dr. Yukiko Hori of National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Japan, along with her colleagues have conducted a study that has answered some of the most critical questions on benefit- and cost-based motivation of reward systems. The findings of their study have been published in PLoS Biology.  Discussing what prompted them to undertake the study, Dr. Hori explains  Mental responses such as  feeling more costly and being too lazy to act,  are often a problem in patients with mental disorders such as depression, and the solution lies in the better understanding of what causes such responses. We wanted to look deeper into the mechanism of motivational disturbances in the brain. To do so, Dr. Hori and her team focused on dopamine (DA), the  neurotransmitter  or the signaling molecule that plays the central role in inducing motivation and regulation of behavior based on cost-benefit analysis. The effect of DA in the brain transmits via DA receptors, or molecular anchors that bind the DA molecules and propagate the signals through the neuronal network of the brain. However, as these receptors have distinct roles in DA signal transduction, it was imperative to assess their relative impacts on DA signaling. Therefore, using macaque monkeys as models, the researchers aimed to decipher the roles of two classes of DA receptors the D1-like receptor (D1R) and the D2-like receptor (D2R) in developing benefit- and cost-based motivation.In their study, the researchers first trained the animals to perform  reward size  tasks and  work/delay tasks.  These tasks allowed them to measure how perceived reward size and required effort influenced the task-performing behavior. Dr. Takafumi Minamimoto, the corresponding author of the study explains,  We systematically manipulated the D1R and D2R of these monkeys by injecting them with specific receptor-binding molecules that dampened their biological responses to DA signaling. By positron emission tomography-based imaging of the brains of the animals, the extent of bindings or blockades of the receptors was measured.  Then, under experimental conditions, they offered the monkeys the chance to perform tasks to achieve rewards and noted whether the monkeys accepted or refused to perform the tasks and how quickly they responded to the cues related to the tasks.Analysis of these data unearthed some intriguing insights into the neurobiological mechanism of the decision-making process. The researchers observed that decision-making based on perceived benefit and cost required the involvement of both D1R and D2R, in both incentivizing the motivation (the process in which the size of the rewards inspired the monkeys to perform the tasks) and in increasing delay discounting (the tendency to prefer immediate, smaller rewards over larger, but delayed rewards). It also became clear that DA transmission via D1R and D2R regulates the cost-based motivational process by distinct neurobiological processes for benefits or  reward availability  and costs or  energy expenditure associated with the task.  However, workload discounting the process of discounting the value of the rewards based on the proportion of the effort needed was exclusively related to D2R manipulation.Prof. Hori emphasizes,  The complementary roles of two dopamine receptor subtypes that our study revealed, in the computation of the cost-benefit trade-off to guide action will help us decipher the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.  Their research brings the hope of a future when by manipulating the inbuilt reward system and enhancing the motivation levels, lives of many can be improved.Reference: Hori Y, Nagai Y, Mimura K, et al.

And they use their eight legs much differently than their web-spinning cousins. The true spiders in the order Araneae, the group that most people are familiar with, they usually use all those legs for walking,  says Guilherme Gainett, a UW Madison graduate student, lead author of a new study of the daddy longlegs genome, and a big fan of anything with eight limbs.  If you watch a daddy longlegs move, it will effectively walk on just three pairs of its legs. The remaining pair, the longest, they wave and touch around like a blind man. Those longest legs, the second pair from the front, are covered in hair-like growths that work as sensory organs. They re also divided, like fingers with many knuckles, into articulable sections called tarsomeres. In the case of the species Phalangium opilio, the focus of a study Gainett and UW Madison professor of integrative biology Prashant Sharma published this week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, their longest legs have 80 tarsomeres. Other arthropods have tarsomeres,  says Sharma,  but only harvestmen use them in such a broad range of behaviors   sensing, climbing, fighting, courtship. To find the genes that give harvestmen such unique legs, the researchers used a technique called RNA interference to  knock down    turn off or reduce the expression of   several genes, called Hox genes, known to be involved in organizing body structure in developing embryos in all sorts of animals. What we have been able to show is that two Hox genes acting in combination are sufficient to specify the identity of the first three pairs of legs,  Gainett says.  They tell them,  You re going to be a walking leg,  and,  You re not going to be a pedipalp,  which is the small food-manipulating appendage. When they knocked down Hox genes known as  Deformed  and  Sex combs reduced  in Phalangium eggs, they ended up with embryonic harvestmen whose first three pairs of legs were transformed into short appendages more like pedipalps.Disrupting another set of genes, which have been associated with the development of leg sections in fruit flies and other insects, took away the daddy longlegs  exceptional tarsomeres. This is the first data outside of insects that points to how it is that these structures are made,  Sharma says.  And we see that evolution is not really coming up with new solutions here. It s recycling the same genetic platform to make these organs even as they evolve independently in different species. They are genetic platforms that appear to come in handy for even more differentiation   and may have helped Phalangium opilio spread upward, in a very local sense, and outward in more global terms.While the UW Madison researchers collected their study specimens from the stone walls of their own campus building in Wisconsin, Phalangium is probably the most widespread of all harvestmen species. It has expanded from a native range in Eurasia to North America, Africa and New Zealand. There s a very tight correlation to having a large number of tarsomeres and being able to climb, and climbing groups also tend to be much more diverse,  says Sharma, whose work is supported by the National Science Foundation.  The most diverse family of harvestmen by far happens to be the one that has the most tarsomeres. So, it s providing some sort of ecological advantage. The researchers hope to use the results of the study, which included collaborators at the Smithsonian Institution s Global Genome Initiative and Eastern Connecticut State University, to examine genes involved in the number and locations of eye structures in spiders and their relatives.Reference: Gainett G, Gonz lez VL, Ballesteros JA, et al.

Their new study offers insight into how this form of blood cancer can develop in children. In the future, the new findings may help identify which patients have a high-risk form of the disease.Cancer is caused by mistakes in a cell's DNA; the longer we live, the greater the chance of such changes. The number of DNA faults gradually adds up as we get older. But children's cells have relatively few DNA changes   so it is still unclear why children can develop cancer.In a new study, scientists from the Princess M xima Center for pediatric oncology looked at the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children. Some 25 children are diagnosed each year, and in around a quarter of the children the disease comes back after treatment. Better understanding of the causes and underlying biology is needed to improve treatment.","Published: August 9, 2021"

Using these new genomes as references, plant scientists can better select for genes likely to lead to better crop yields or stress tolerance. It s allowing you to get a much more precise understanding of what s driving variation of traits,  Hufford said.  If a breeder really wants to select for the right variation to produce a trait they re interested in, and they only have a foggy view of the genetic causes of variation in that trait, they re working with their hands tied behind their backs. So we re giving them a lot more information to go on. The first corn genome to be mapped was the genetic line known as B73, a line developed at Iowa State. Patrick Schnable, director of the ISU Plant Sciences Institute; and Doreen Ware, adjunct professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and USDA research scientist, led the effort to assemble the genome, which was completed in 2009. Since then, B73 has served as the primary reference genome for corn, with a handful of additional genome assemblies becoming available only in the last few years. That means scientists have a limited understanding of genetic sequences in other corn genomes that aren t present in B73. While the first genome was invaluable, providing an initial parts list and partial wiring diagram, we knew it was not complete,  Ware said.  It was critical to develop other genome references to understand the genetic architecture underlying important agricultural traits. But the 26 genomes mapped in the new study encompass a wide range of genetic diversity, everything from popcorn to sweetcorn to field corn from various geographical and environmental conditions. This provides much more reference data for scientists combing maize genetics for targets that could lead to better crop performance. ","Published: August 9, 2021"

In a recent study published in ASRM s Fertility & Sterility F&S Reports, Randy Morris, M.D. used frozen embryo transfer as a model for comparing the implantation rates between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine seropositive, infection seropositive, and seronegative women. His study concluded that there was no difference found in serum hCG documented implantation rates or sustained implantation rates among the three groups.This study is critical because vaccine hesitancy in reproductive-aged women is concerning and has resulted from the spread of misinformation on social media stating that COVID-19 vaccines will cause sterility in women.This study documented, for the first time in women, that seropositivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein -- whether from vaccination or COVID infection -- does not prevent embryo implantation or early pregnancy development. Physicians and other health professionals must counsel women of reproductive age that neither previous COVID-19 illness nor antibodies produced from vaccination to COVID-19 will cause sterility. We hope that all reproductive-aged women will be more confident getting the COVID-19 vaccine, given Dr. Morris s findings that the vaccine does not cause female sterility,  said Hugh Taylor, M.D., president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).

Virus researchers are determined to discover a means to broadly safeguard people from the continuing threat of emerging coronaviruses.Clues for creating such an overarching countermeasure might come from a rare type of human antibody that can neutralize several different coronaviruses.  These antibodies have been detected in some people who have recovered from COVID-19.A paper appearing Aug. 3 in the journal Science describes research on five such human monoclonal antibodies that can cross-react with a number of beta-coronaviruses.  These antibodies target a structure, called stem helix, in the spike protein of these viruses.  The spike protein is critical to the virus  ability to overtake host cells.The lead authors on the study were Dora Pinto, Maximilian M. Sauer, Nadine Czudnochowski and Jun Siong Low and the senior scientists were David Veesler, associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, and Davide Corti of Humabs Biomed SA, Vir Biotechnology, in Switzerland.The stem helix in the spike protein has remained conserved during the evolution of certain coronaviruses.  That means it is much less prone to genetic changes and is similar in various coronaviruses.  These include those originating in bats that have become dangerous pathogens in people, and another subgenus that causes a serious human lung disease transmitted by dromedary camels, as well as a few other subgenera that cause simple common cold symptoms.The researchers explain in their paper that they were interested in exploring antibodies that target highly conserved regions of the spike protein machinery that enable coronaviruses to fuse with the membrane of host cells. (Other parts of the infective machinery conduct the initial engagement with the cells  receptors; those parts of the coronavirus spike have a tendency to rapidly mutate and form variants under selective pressure from the body s antibody response.) An antibody s ability to bind to the less mutable fusion machinery is what allows it to neutralize distantly related coronaviruses. To find these sorts of antibodies, the researchers examined certain memory B cells from COVID-19 convalescent donors. Memory B cells are white blood cells that recognize and respond to pathogens that have tried to attack the body during a previous encounter.Out of five promising antibodies that they isolated, the scientists decided to concentrate on one designated S2P6.  Molecular structure analysis and functional studies showed that this human monoclonal antibody had impressive breadth:  it was able to neutralize three different subgenera of beta-coronaviruses. The scientists observed that it did so by inhibiting the virus  ability to fuse with cell membranes. The researchers went on to test if the S2P6 stem helix antibody could protect against SARS-CoV-2 by administering it to hamsters 24 hours before exposure.  They found that this antibody reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting entry of the virus and by enhancing additional anti-viral and virus-clearing cellular immune responses. Studies of the plasma from pre-pandemic human samples, as well as from COVID-vaccinated and COVID-recovered individuals were also analyzed to see how frequently the stem-helix targeting antibodies appeared.  The highest frequencies occurred in people who had recovered from COVID-19, then were later vaccinated.   Overall, however, the data from this study shows that, while it does occur, it is relatively rare for SARS-CoV-2 to elicit plasma stem-helix antibody responses.  The researchers hope that additional studies might reveal whether this is the case for antibodies that target other parts of the coronavirus fusion machinery or only for those that target the stem helix.The researchers also looked at how the broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies studied in this project might have originated.  Their findings suggest that they may have resulted from the priming of B memory cells through one of the common cold-inducing coronaviruses.  Then the virus-specific B cells gained cross-reactivity through somatic mutations occurring during the body s immune response to a natural infection with another type of coronavirus.The results from this study indicate that eliciting a sufficient quantity of stem helix antibodies through a standard vaccination development approach likely would be difficult.  However, the researchers propose that recent computational protein-design advances for potential vaccine candidates against respiratory syncytial viruses and multiple influenza viruses might be adapted to try to induce broad beta coronavirus immunity and overcome the pan-coronavirus vaccine challenge.Reference: Pinto D, Sauer MM, Czudnochowski N, et al.

It is recommended that the vaccine is given in two doses that are administered 28 days apart.The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has shown strong efficacy preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 in clinical trials. The vaccine has also received regulatory approval or emergency authorisation in several countries and is being widely used in the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.Provisional approval of this vaccine in Australia is subject to certain strict conditions, such as the requirement for Moderna Australia Pty Ltd to continue providing information to the TGA on longer-term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment.Data to support the use of Moderna s COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years are currently under evaluation and no specific concerns have been identified to date. The TGA s decision on use in this age group will be announced separately.The Australian Government has secured 25 million doses of Spikevax (elasomeran) to further diversify Australia's vaccine portfolio as well as provide access to a booster or variant vaccine should this be required in the future. The agreement includes the supply of 10 million doses of Spikevax (elasomeran) in 2021 and of 15 million doses of Moderna's updated variant booster vaccine in 2022. More information about Australia s vaccine agreements can be found on the Department of Health s Australia s Vaccine Agreements(link is external) webpage.Spikevax (elasomeran) is the second mRNA vaccine to receive provisional approval in Australia. mRNA vaccines use a synthetic genetic code called RNA to give our cells instructions about how to make the coronavirus  unique spike protein. When our body has made the protein encoded by the mRNA vaccine, it then recognises the spike protein as being foreign and launches an immune response against it. The RNA from the vaccine does not change, or interact, with our DNA in any way.Australians can be confident that the TGA's review process of Spikevax (elasomeran) was rigorous. The decision to provisionally approve the vaccine was also informed by expert advice from the Advisory Committee on Vaccines (ACV), an independent committee with expertise in scientific, medical and clinical fields including consumer representation.The TGA will continue to actively monitor the safety of Spikevax (elasomeran) and will not hesitate to take action if safety concerns are identified.

The results, published in Nature Communications, also support the idea that pre-existing antibodies against common cold coronaviruses could protect against COVID-19.In order to predict the pandemic s evolution and develop effective strategies, it is critical to better understand the dynamics and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as well as the possible role of pre-existing antibodies against the coronaviruses that cause common colds. With this goal in mind, the team led by ISGlobal researcher Carlota Doba o followed a cohort of healthcare workers at the Hospital Clinic (SEROCOV study) from the beginning of the pandemic, in order to evaluate the levels of antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens over time.  This is the first study that evaluates antibodies to such a large panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over 7 months,  says Doba o. The research team analysed blood samples from 578 participants, taken at four different timepoints between March and October 2020. They used the Luminex technology to measure, in the same sample, the level and type of IgA, IgM or IgG antibodies to 6 different SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as the presence of antibodies against the four coronaviruses that cause common colds in humans. They also analysed the neutralising activity of antibodies in collaboration with researchers at the University of Barcelona. The study had funding from the European innovation network EIT Health.The results show that the majority of infections among healthcare workers occurred during the first pandemic wave (the percentage of participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased only slightly between March and October   from 13.5% to 16.4%). With the exception of IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N), the rest of IgG antibodies (including those with neutralising activity) remained stable over time, confirming results from other recent studies. Rather surprisingly, we even saw an increase of IgG anti-Spike antibodies in 75% of the participants from month five onwards, without any evidence of re-exposure to the virus,  says Gemma Moncunill, senior co-author of the study. No reinfections were observed in the cohort. Regarding antibodies against human cold coronaviruses (HCoV), the results suggest that they could confer cross-protection against COVID-19 infection or disease. People who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 had lower levels of HCoV antibodies. Moreover, asymptomatic individuals had higher levels of anti-HCoV IgG and IgA than those with symptomatic infections.  Although cross-protection by pre-existing immunity to common cold coronaviruses remains to be confirmed, this could help explain the big differences in susceptibility to the disease within the population,  says Doba o.

IBERLID is an interactive database of the results of lead isotope analyses from geological and archaeological samples in the Iberian Peninsula.""This work set out to compile all possible data on lead isotopes in the Iberian Peninsula and to make them accessible to everyone; the data have a set of geological criteria, whereby the mines can be separated by the area in which they appear, by the type of material, etc.,"" said Sonia Garc a de Madinabeitia, author of the work. ""One of the applications of lead isotope analyses is to try to associate archaeological remains, samples produced by humans in ancient times, with deposits and ores, i.e. with the spot where the metal was extracted. To this end, it is essential to obtain a lot of data and to have a database for comparison purposes,"" explained Garc a de Madinabeitia. In the end, ""the aim of any database,"" said the researcher, ""is to have as comprehensive and detailed a collection of comparable samples and results as possible. ""IBERLID brings together about 3000 lead isotopic analyses originating from more than 140 different references. The database includes results on minerals, rocks and metallic archaeological objects, which are standardised to allow samples to be selected, grouped and traced,"" added the researcher from the UPV/EHU's Department of Geology. The use of lead isotopic data has been shown to be a useful tool in the investigation of raw materials in geological site exploration and metal provenance studies in archaeology. Users of this type of information have often requested complete datasets that include not only numerical values of isotope ratios, but also mineralogical and geological information about the samples analysed, to enable the data to be compared. ""The IBERLID database addresses this demand; it allows lead isotope results to be used in a straightforward way and facilitates their comparison. It is not just an extensive table of lead isotope ratios. It also includes interactive tools that link together isotope ratios, geographical, geological, mineralogical and archaeological information, thus providing new ways of selecting, grouping and comparing data on the samples,"" explained Sonia Garc a de Madinabeitia. All IBERLID samples can be located on a map by using the geographical information included in the database. On the map the samples are colour-coded according to their characteristics. The interactive map allows the user to zoom in or out to locate samples in detail, and to show or hide them by selecting them from the menu. According to Garc a de Madinabeitia, ""the collection and evaluation of data from almost three thousand lead isotopic analyses is expected to contribute towards and expand the knowledge about the geology and isotopic composition of the deposits across the Iberian Peninsula"". ""Now that the database has been completed, the idea now is to continue working along the same lines and try to expand it geographically; it would also be interesting to include other types of analysis in addition to lead isotopes,"" added the UPV/EHU researcher.ReferenceGarc a de Madinabeitia S, Gil Ibarguchi JI, Santos Zalduegui JF.

In addition, findings suggested using chlorophyll as a proxy measure for the presence of microcystin may not be as reliable as previously thought. Those issues can only be overcome with more frequent data collection,  said Justin Chaffin, senior researcher and research coordinator at The Ohio State University s Stone Laboratory and lead author of the study. We have good biomass data from satellites, so we can see where the bloom is and how thick it is, but there s never a direct link between bloom biomass and how much toxin there is in the water. To measure the toxin you have to be out on a boat grabbing a sample. The research is published online in the journal Harmful Algae.The HABS Grab principal funder, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), annually forecasts the summer harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie, basing predictions on data derived from high-quality satellite imagery.Microcystis is the main type of cyanobacteria that compose the HAB in Lake Erie, and it can produce high amounts of microcystins, which can pose risks to human and wildlife health. A dangerously high concentration of the toxin overwhelmed a Lake Erie water treatment plant in 2014, leading to the three-day Toledo drinking water crisis.Lake Erie supplies drinking water to an estimated 11 million people in the United States and Canada   and for that reason alone, not to mention the lake s recreational uses and economic benefits   it s important to have a better handle on the toxicity of the annual bloom, Chaffin said. Obviously, we don t want toxins in there,  he said.  Stepping further away, we re understanding how blooms occur in lakes and their spatial distribution, and the physiology that causes cyanobacteria to produce microcystins. We wanted to take the HABS Grab approach to quantify microcystins in a way that might help us eventually estimate its concentrations from day to day or week to week. The two grabs took place on Aug. 9, 2018, and Aug. 7, 2019. On each of those days, 40 or so scientists   a U.S. team in 2018 and a joint U.S.-Canadian effort in 2019   boarded boats to collect water samples across the western basin, covering roughly 880 square miles. Back in their labs, researchers analyzed the samples  contents for nutrients, toxins, pigments and cyanobacterial DNA.In 2018, the highest detected microcystin concentrations of between 2 to 5 micrograms per liter were found in water hugging the Ohio shoreline and surrounding the Bass Islands. In contrast, the highest concentrations of between 15 and 50 micrograms per liter were measured in Maumee Bay in 2019   but in the same year, microcystins were below detectable levels near the Detroit River outflow and around the Bass Islands.According to Ohio Environmental Protection Agency standards, treated drinking water should contain no more than 1.6 micrograms of microcystin per liter for adults and 0.3 micrograms per liter of the toxin for children. Water treatment plants monitor for microcystins, but Chaffin said that in an ideal scenario, scientists could tell plant operators when and at what concentration microcystins will be present in advance of the bloom reaching their intake.The authors noted that the 12- and 30-ton biomass estimates of toxins in the blooms are largely a function of how big the western basin is. They estimated the basin-wide average concentration of microcystins at 0.52 and 1.38 micrograms per liter in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and noted that the concentrations detected in the HABS Grab samples varied by nearly two orders of magnitude over very short distances.Less helpful was the finding that the microcystin-to-chlorophyll ratio varied widely throughout the western basin, indicating that incorrect water treatment decisions could be made if they rely solely on chlorophyll.There are even potential bright spots, Chaffin said: The location of the toxins aligned with water currents, indicating that water currents can be used to forecast where those toxins will be transported, and the microcystin-to-chlorophyll ratio increased with nitrogen concentrations, suggesting nitrogen affects how much toxin a cyanobacteria cell can produce. We really needed a high-spatial-resolution toxin dataset so we can compare it to the satellites and see, within one day, what the relationship is between toxins and bloom biomass,  Chaffin said.  What we found is that the relationship between toxins and biomass even on one day is not consistent across the lake. The HABS Grab was an enormous undertaking and hasn t been repeated since 2019. But the team hopes this study lays the groundwork for future data collection to broaden understanding of how toxins circulate during the annual harmful algal bloom and to bolster work to reduce related health risks. In order to be sure we implement the right strategies to protect the public and ecosystem health, we need to know as much information as we can, and one of the key pieces of information comes from this kind of sampling,  said Felix Martinez, a program manager for the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science.  If a really comprehensive dataset could be developed, taking a snapshot at different points in time over the bloom season, that might give us a better idea of how to predict conditions for a given year. In the meantime, the researchers are continuing to analyze the samples for purposes ranging from characterizing microbial communities in the water to ecosystem modeling.Reference: Chaffin JD, Bratton JF, Verhamme EM, et al.

The protein, named  curly , has been observed bending the material that makes up the cytoskeleton for the first time.Their results, from research supported by the European Research Council and Wellcome Trust, are published in the journal eLife and point to new ways to modify and engineer cells, as well as a better understanding of how they replicate   a process essential to all living organisms.All living matter is made up of cells, which are surrounded by a fragile and flexible membrane much like a balloon. This is supported by a cytoskeleton composed of a material called actin that give structure and stability to cells. Filaments of actin are semi-flexible and normally straight and it has long been thought that they form structures by stacking together like matchsticks.During cell division a cell will create a cytokinetic ring, a type of machinery comprised of actin and motor proteins called myosin, along the centre of the surrounding membrane. The myosins then constrict the actin filaments together and squeeze the cell down its middle until it divides   as if making the parts of a balloon animal, except from the inside.Until now, it was thought that the actin filaments that comprise the cytokinetic ring break up as the cell is squeezed tighter. An interdisciplinary collaboration between Professor Mohan Balasubramanian, Dr Saravanan Palani (now at the Indian Institute of Science) and Dr Darius K ster at the University of Warwick was astonished to find that a segment of the protein Rng2, nicknamed  curly , can naturally curve actin, with 10 micrometres of actin forming a ring less than a micrometre in diameter.It could suggest that  curly  plays a key role in allowing the cytokinetic ring to shrink tightly enough to divide a cell.More than 20 years ago, Rng2 was discovered by one of the lead authors, Professor Mohan Balasubramanian, as an important protein in this process, but only now have researchers made the astonishing observation that it can bend actin filaments into actual rings. Rng2 is related to the highly conserved IQGAP family of proteins present from yeast to human, so the findings may be relevant to other cells as well, including human.Lead author Dr Darius K ster of Warwick Medical School said:  What we show is if we have this protein on the membrane and we polymerise fresh actin filaments at the membrane, representing what is happening in the cytokinetic ring, the actin starts to bend. If you have it in a cell, it s a curved surface so the actin would curve. As far as we know, there are no other proteins doing this kind of job with individual filaments. If you look inside cells, there are definitely curved actin structures, but it was thought that they were stacks of very short straight filaments packed together. This opens the perspective that it could be geometries and certain organelles that the actin is actually wound around. The researchers used what is known as a reconstitution approach, in which they examine a complex system by separating it into its constituent parts, then reassemble it to find out what role each individual element plays.For this study, that was funded by the European Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, they made a lipid bilayer to represent the cell membrane and experimented with adding different proteins to it that are normally found at the interface with the cytokinetic ring during cell division. They then added actin filaments and myosin to represent the ring itself. It was when  curly  was present that they observed the actin forming highly curved structures, behaviour not normally seen in these kinds of experiments.It opens the possibility of using  curly  as a tool to engineer different shapes of cells. Scientists could use it to modify the cytoskeleton and twist the cell into new shapes, in a manner similar to balloon modelling.Dr K ster adds:  We have very few tools we can use to modify the cell cortex and for the first time we have a way to engineer bent actin structures. Since we can express it in cells and the cells react to it, we can use it to modify what the cell cortex looks like. This can help us to really understand how curved actin can deform membranes, or whether the cell uses this as a mechanism to control certain processes. There seem to be some proteins that like to twist and change the curvature of actin and if that s happening then it s very likely that there will be other proteins that take that as an information cue.

An international study with the participation of GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, which has now been published in the journal Science Advances, provides new insights into the complex biogeochemical processes at the base of the marine ecosystem.All life starts at a small scale, also in the ocean. Microscopic organisms, phytoplankton, form an important basis for the entire marine ecosystem, which ultimately determines how fish stocks develop and how much atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by the ocean. In this respect, understanding the basis of the marine ecosystem is important for two elementary questions for the future of our human population: nutrition and climate. Scientists from Dalhousie University, University of Liverpool, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and Scripps Institution of Oceanography have developed a new model for studying phytoplankton growth in the ocean. The model was coupled to metaproteomic and environmental data to allow accurate predictions of e.g. phytoplankton growth rates in the Southern Ocean.  You can think of phytoplankton growth like industrial manufacturing in a factory: Materials come into the factory and are processed on assembly lines, creating the final product , explains Scott McCain, lead author of the study and a PhD student in the Department of Biology at Canada's Dalhousie University.  We asked ourselves how to increase output, which is the amount of products leaving the factory , McCain adds. Applied to phytoplankton, that means how can they grow faster?  As part of the study, we found that phytoplankton rearrange their 'cellular assembly lines' to do this , explained Prof. Dr. Eric Achterberg, co-author of the study from GEOMAR.  We were not concerned with the amount of available nutrients, including iron and manganese, that are important for the growth of phytoplankton, but rather with the question of how the  cellular assembly lines  in the phytoplankton that process the source substances for their growth adapt to changes , Achterberg continued. To do this, the researchers created a mathematical model of a phytoplankton that enabled them to simulate these processes. The model was linked to laboratory and cruise data from the Southern Ocean on metaproteomics, dissolved iron and manganese. This allowed them to obtain new explanations for various phytoplankton processes.  Our results show that cumulative cellular costs determine how environmental conditions change the growth of phytoplankton , says Professor Achterberg.  This fundamentally changes the way we look at phytoplankton growth and will lead to better predictions of how phytoplankton will grow in the ocean , adds Scott McCain. According to the Canadian scientists these findings are also important for predictions on the development of fish stocks and global climate change.ReferenceMcCain JSP, Tagliabue A, Susko E, Achterberg EP, Allen AE, Bertrand EM.

We explored the provision of recommended and non-recommended milk products to infants and toddlers, so we looked at infant formulas, toddler milks, cow milks, and non-dairy milks. We also wanted to find any sociodemographic factors that might be associated with the types of milks offered by caregivers of diverse backgrounds,  said Maria J. Romo-Palafox, PhD, RD, Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Doisy College of Health Sciences, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO, USA. Approximately two-thirds of caregivers reported serving the types of milk that experts recommend for their infant or toddler, including breastfeeding and/or serving commercially prepared infant formula with no other milk type to infants and serving cow s milk to toddlers. However, more than one-third of infant caregivers surveyed reported serving at least one non-recommended milk type to their infant in the past month, including toddler milk and/or cow s milk, and most reported providing them daily. Furthermore, the majority of toddler caregivers did not follow expert recommendations to provide only cow s milk to their children and tended to provide non-recommended milk-types infant formula most often, followed by toddler milk and plant milk in addition to recommended milk types. Researchers found that factors such as the child s age, household income, the racial and ethnic background of the caregiver, and the product s marketing claims were associated with which milk type the children received, suggesting that more research is needed to understand how diverse populations interpret product claims and how marketing may perpetuate health disparities.  It s important to note that infant formulas are not inherently bad. We are glad this product exists for moms who cannot breastfeed. But the public should have all the information so they can make an informed decision about what is best for their baby,  Dr. Romo-Palafox explained. The results of this study indicate an opportunity for public health education campaigns, community outreach, and additional guidance from healthcare providers, especially regarding potential nutrient deficiencies, dehydration, and undernutrition when providing cow s milk or plant milk to infants and replacing breastmilk (or commercially prepared infant formula).ReferenceRomo-Palafox MJ, Harris JL.

Callaway, Jr. Professor of Chemistry and director of the Worm Institute for Research and Medicine at Scripps Research, in La Jolla, CA. It has been known for 10 or 15 years that salicylanilides work against certain viruses,  Janda says.  However, they tend to be gut-restricted and can have toxicity issues. Janda s compound overcomes both issues, in mouse and cell-based tests, acting as both an antiviral and an anti-inflammatory drug-like compound, with properties that auger well for its use in pill form.Salicylanilides were first discovered in Germany in the 1950s and used to address worm infections in cattle. Versions including the drug niclosamide are used in animals and humans today to treat tapeworm. They have also been studied for anti-cancer and antimicrobial properties.The modified salicylanilide compound that Janda created was one of about 60 that he built years ago for another project. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus became a global pandemic in early 2020, knowing that they may have antiviral properties, he started screening his old collection, first in cells with collaborators from Sorrento Therapeutics and The University of Texas Medical Branch, and later, after seeing promising results, working with Scripps Research immunologist John Teijaro, PhD, who conducted rodent studies.One compound stood out. Dubbed simply  No. 11,  it differs from the commercial tapeworm medicines in key ways, including its ability to pass beyond the gut and be absorbed into the bloodstream and without the worrisome toxicity. Niclosamide is basically digestive-track restricted, and that makes sense, because that s where parasites reside,  Janda says.  For that reason, simple drug repurposing for a COVID treatment would be counterintuitive, as you want something that is readily bioavailable, yet does not possess the systemic toxicity that niclosamide has. About 80 percent of salicylanilide 11 passed into the bloodstream, compared to about 10 percent of the antiparasitic drug niclosamide, which has recently entered clinical trials as a COVID-19 treatment, Janda says.  The experiments showed that of the many modified salicylanilides he had built in his laboratory, No. 11 affected pandemic coronavirus infections in two ways. First, it interfered with how the virus deposited its genetic material into infected cells, a process called endocytosis. Endocytosis requires the virus to form a lipid-based packet around viral genes. The packet enters the infected cell and dissolves, so the infected cell s protein-building machinery can read it and churn out new viral copies. No. 11 appears to prevent the packet s dissolution. The compound s antiviral mechanism is the key,  Janda says.  It blocks the viral material from getting out of the endosome, and it just gets degraded. This process does not allow new viral particles to be made as readily. Importantly, because it acts inside cells rather than on viral spikes, questions about whether it would work in new variants like Delta and Lambda aren t a concern, he adds. This mechanism is not dependent on the virus spike protein, so these new variants coming up aren t going to relegate us to finding new molecules as is the case with vaccines or antibodies,  Janda says.In addition, No. 11 helped quiet potentially toxic inflammation in the research animals, Janda says, which could be important for treating acute respiratory distress associated with life-threatening COVID infections. It reduced levels of interleukin 6, a signaling protein which is a key contributor of inflammation typically found in advanced stages of COVID-19.Better medications against COVID-19 are urgently needed, as highly infectious new variants drive renewed surges of illness and death globally. But Janda says salicylanilide No. 11 was created long before the pandemic.After fighting an unpleasant bacterial infection called Clostridioides difficile about 10 years ago, he saw a clear need for better treatment options. Multi-drug-resistant strains of C. difficile have become a major cause of drug-resistant diarrheal disease outbreaks in health care institutions globally, and among people using antibiotics. As director of the Worm Institute, which focused on parasitic infections, Janda was very familiar with salicylanilides, and knew of their antimicrobial properties. His laboratory created a  library  of modified salicylanilides several of which showed strong efficacy against C. difficile, and the collection was subsequently licensed by pharmaceutical firm Sorrento Therapeutics. Among them was salicylanilide 11.   Salicylanilide 11 actually was placed on the back burner in my laboratory against C. difficile because it s not as gut-restricted as we would like it to be,  Janda says.  But salicylanilide 11 has got a lot of really positive things going for it as a potential therapeutic for COVID. Reference: Blake S, Shaabani N, Eubanks LM, et al.

Now, researchers at Gladstone Institutes have taken a closer look at the life cycle of energy-generating cellular power plants called mitochondria  inside brain cells, and how they might be recycled. They showed that genes associated with Parkinson s disease play key roles in this process. This work gives us unprecedented insight into mitochondria s life cycle and how they are recycled by key proteins that, when mutated, cause Parkinson s disease,  says Gladstone Associate Investigator Ken Nakamura, MD, PhD, senior author of the new study.

After diagnosis, fewer than 10 percent of patients survive for five years. While some chemotherapies are initially effective, pancreatic tumors often become resistant to them. The disease has also proven difficult to treat with newer approaches such as immunotherapy. However, a team of MIT researchers has now developed an immunotherapy strategy and shown that it can eliminate pancreatic tumors in mice.The new therapy, which is a combination of three drugs that help boost the body s own immune defenses against tumors, is expected to enter clinical trials later this year. We don t have a lot of good options for treating pancreatic cancer. It s a devastating disease clinically,  says William Freed-Pastor, a senior postdoc at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.  If this approach led to durable responses in patients, it would make a big impact in at least a subset of patients  lives, but we need to see how it will actually perform in trials.

In a new study, they showed that the diagnostic is just as accurate as the PCR tests now used.The device can also be used to detect specific viral mutations linked to some of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are now circulating. This result can also be obtained within an hour, potentially making it much easier to track different variants of the virus, especially in regions that don t have access to genetic sequencing facilities. We demonstrated that our platform can be programmed to detect new variants that emerge, and that we could repurpose it quite quickly,  says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering.  In this study, we targeted the U.K., South African, and Brazilian variants, but you could readily adapt the diagnostic platform to address the Delta variant and other ones that are emerging.

Now, researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have developed a new method to prevent such infections, by covering a graphene-based material with bactericidal molecules. Through our research, we have succeeded in binding water-insoluble antibacterial molecules to the graphene, and having the molecules release in a controlled, continuous manner from the material  says Santosh Pandit, researcher at the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering at Chalmers, and first author of the study which was recently published in Scientific Reports. This is an essential requirement for the method to work. The way in which we bind the active molecules to the graphene is also very simple, and could be easily integrated into industrial processes .Certain bacteria can form impenetrable surface layers, or  biofilms , on surgical implants, such as dental and other orthopaedic implants, and represent a major problem for healthcare globally. Biofilms are more resistant than other bacteria, and the infections are therefore often difficult to treat, leading to great suffering for patients, and in the worst cases, necessitating removal or replacement of the implants. In addition to the effects on patients, this entails large costs for healthcare providers.","Published: August 9, 2021"

The Magna Carta. The Declaration of Independence. Throughout recorded human history, written records such as these have proclaimed that people deserve freedom, security and dignity. Why, despite huge cultural differences across continents and sweeping societal changes across centuries, have the underlying concepts in these declarations of rights remained largely unchanged?According to a pair of scientists at Brown University, it s because all humans share the same nervous system.In a new scientific paper, the scholars introduce a new concept called  dignity neuroscience    the idea that universal rights are rooted in human brain science. The authors argue that numerous studies in disciplines such as developmental psychology and neuroscience bolster long-held notions that people thrive when they enjoy basic rights such as agency, self-determination, freedom from want or fear, and freedom of expression. And they say science also supports the idea that when societies fail to offer their citizens such rights, allowing them to fall into poverty, privation, violence and war, there can be lasting neurological and psychological consequences.The paper was published on Wednesday, Aug. 4, in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.Tara White, the paper s lead author and an assistant professor (research) of behavioral and social sciences at Brown, said she believes grounding universal human rights in science could help people see themselves in the sweeping statements of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I think the average person on the street sees universal human rights as an international law concept that has more to do with trade than about individual lives,  White said.  But this stuff is not pie-in-the-sky, and it affects us all. We want to show people that ensuring universal human rights is a crucial foundation for a society that is healthy   not only socially and physically, but also psychologically and neurologically. White   who is affiliated with Brown s Carney Institute for Brain Science  and co-author Meghan Gonsalves, a Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience at Brown, outlined five core concepts that underlie most universal rights declarations: agency, autonomy and self-determination; freedom from want; freedom from fear; uniqueness; and unconditionality. All five, they argue, reflect fundamental features of human brain structure, function and development. For instance, multiple studies on learning and emotion have shown that gray matter in multiple regions of the brain helps people draw on their own memories to assess whether goals are worth pursuing or whether risks are worth taking. Those studies demonstrate that agency  the ability to shape one s own choices and actions in the world  is intrinsic to the brain. In addition, studies have shown that observers, victims and combatants of war experience long-term brain trauma in the form of heightened stress levels, negative emotions and fears of physical danger, even after threats of violence have passed   adding scientific weight to declarations that all people deserve to be shielded from war when possible. With this paper, we had an opportunity to show that the idea of universal human rights as a foundation for a healthy society isn t just a social phenomenon but also a deeply empirical and scientific one,  Gonsalves said.  Applying scientific studies and hard evidence to universal human rights can help demonstrate why these rights need to be defended and respected across the world. The idea of  dignity neuroscience  first emerged for White three years ago, when she was invited to a human rights conference in London while serving as a visiting international fellow at the British Academy and the University of Cambridge. White was the only behavioral neuroscientist in a room full of United Nations officials and international law experts, and at first, she considered herself an outside observer rather than a participant. As many in the room lamented an apparent global shift away from allegiance to universal rights  an increasing number of leaders, they noted, were sanctioning the free press, stripping away voting rights and modifying democratic laws with impunity   White felt she had no advice to offer. Then the lightning bolt hit: Every single part of my training was relevant to these ideas,  White said.  All of the very complex international laws they were discussing fell into five categories, and all of them had a basis in psychology and developmental neuroscience. I stood up at the end of the conference and essentially outlined my idea for this paper and asked,  Would this be helpful for your work?  And the speakers said,  Yes, we ve never considered these ideas, we think they might help. In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged all seven continents and Americans were locked in bitter division over politics, racism and police violence, White felt that exploring the intersection of neuroscience and universal rights had taken on added urgency. Gonsalves agreed. I felt a certain fire in my belly to somehow respond to the pandemonium surrounding the election, inequalities that the pandemic was exacerbating, and increased violence against Black Americans,  Gonsalves said.  I wanted to help others and build a better society, and I think these ideas can do that. I believe the more we can use science to communicate our commonalities and differences, the more successful we will be in encouraging compassion. White said that while the paper provides a comprehensive set of connections between universal rights law and brain science, she hopes the work inspires more connection between people in vastly different fields of study. Crossing traditionally siloed scientific aisles could lead to breakthroughs for brain scientists, social scientists and law experts alike.Understanding and considering  dignity neuroscience  could also, White said, help lawmakers and voters appreciate the simultaneous importance of providing each person with the same basic rights while also giving them room to live as they please. It s true, she said, that all human brains work in broadly similar ways; for example, responding positively to others  affirmations and negatively to trauma. But brains are also plastic: They develop in response to the experiences they endure and the surroundings they observe, adapting with each new experience and change of scenery. Therefore, no two brains, and by extension no two humans, are exactly alike. If I had one takeaway, it would be this: People are worthy of respect because of who they are, because they are the same as you and because they are different than you,  White said.  We all have common needs, and when those needs are fulfilled, it helps us flourish. But at the same time, each of us deserves space for agency, because we are all unique.

They found that a year after giving birth, the biological age of mothers who slept less than seven hours a night at the six-month mark was three to seven years older than those who logged seven hours or more.Mothers who slept less than seven hours also had shorter telomeres in their white blood cells. These small pieces of DNA at the ends of chromosomes act as protective caps, like the plastic tips on the ends of shoelaces. Shortened telomeres have been linked to a higher risk of cancers, cardiovascular and other diseases, and earlier death. The early months of postpartum sleep deprivation could have a lasting effect on physical health,  said the study s first author, Judith Carroll, UCLA s George F. Solomon Professor of Psychobiology.  We know from a large body of research that sleeping less than seven hours a night is detrimental to health and increases the risk of age-related diseases. While participants  nightly sleep ranged from five to nine hours, more than half were getting less than seven hours, both six months and one year after giving birth, the researchers report. We found that with every hour of additional sleep, the mother s biological age was younger,  said Carroll, a member of the Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology at UCLA s Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior.  I, and many other sleep scientists, consider sleep health to be just as vital to overall health as diet and exercise. Carroll urged new mothers take advantage of opportunities to get a little extra sleep, like taking naps during the day when their baby is asleep, accepting offers of assistance from family and friends, and, when possible, asking their partner to help with the baby during the night or early morning.  Taking care of your sleep needs will help you and your baby in the long run,  she said.Co-author Christine Dunkel Schetter, a distinguished professor of psychology and psychiatry at UCLA, said the study results  and other findings on maternal postpartum mental health provide impetus for better supporting mothers of young infants so that they can get sufficient sleep   possibly through parental leave so that both parents can bear some of the burden of care, and through programs for families and fathers. Dunkel Schetter added that while accelerated biological aging linked to sleep loss may increase women s health risks, it doesn t automatically cause harm to their bodies.  We don t want the message to be that mothers are permanently damaged by infant care and loss of sleep,  she emphasized.  We don't know if these effects are long lasting.

During the imaging process, a probe sends a beam of light into the eye and measures how long various reflections take to bounce back to decipher the structures within the tissue.In the clinic, OCT systems are traditionally large tabletop systems, which a highly trained technician uses to capture several images of the eye. Patients must be firmly settled into a head and chin rest to ensure the correct positioning and to limit any motion. Beyond being uncomfortable, these head and chin rests don t fit everyone, making it difficult for certain people to get scanned. Not everywhere has a resource like the Duke Eye Center, where we have access to these highly trained and specialized technicians like ophthalmic photographers,  said Ryan McNabb, a research scientist in the Department of Ophthalmology at the Duke University Medical Center.  But with our new tool, you wouldn t need advanced training to use it. We re optimistic that something like this could easily be used in places like optometrist offices, primary-care clinics, or even emergency departments. OCT is a useful diagnostic tool, and these kinds of advances help make it easier for wider communities to access it.  To use their scanner, a patient approaches the machine and stands in front of the robotic arm. 3D cameras placed to the left and right of the robot help to find the patient in space, while smaller cameras in the robotic arm search for landmarks on the eye to precisely position the scanner. The system is able to scan both the macula (the part of the retina responsible for our central vision) and cornea (the clear front part of the eye), sites where many eye diseases occur. It takes the tool less than 10 seconds to scan and image each eye, and the entire process is complete in less than 50 seconds.  The robotic arm gives us the flexibility of handheld OCT scanners, but we don t need to worry about any operator tremor,  said Mark Draelos, a postdoctoral fellow in the biomedical engineering department.  If a person moves, the robot moves with it. As long as the scanner is aligned to within a centimeter of where it needs to be on your pupil, the scanner can get an image that is as good as a tabletop scanner. Because the patient is never in physical contact with the system, their tool avoids any hygiene and infectious diseases concerns that arise with the shared chin and headrest in traditional OCT systems. The researchers also demonstrate that their robotic system is very safe especially considering how close it can get to a patient s face. The camera systems continuously track the patient and allow the robot to keep a safe distance,  said Draelos.  In fact, the only time we ve seen any unintended robot contact is if a person walks or bumps into the robot when it isn t imaging their eye. The team has already begun the next phase of work in the clinic, where they have started to image the eyes of volunteers to continue to refine the robot s targeting. Next, they hope to image patients that have actual retinal or corneal diseases to test how well their robot can capture abnormalities.They are also working to improve the field of view for the retinal scanner, as their first iteration was able to capture key features, but multiple images would need to be spliced together to get a full view of the retina. While this is a solution for image collection issues, we think it will pair incredibly well with recent advances in machine learning for OCT image interpretation,  said McNabb.  We re really bringing OCT to the patients rather than limiting these tools to specialized clinics, and I think it will make it much easier to help a wider population of people.

These shifts in mood can sometimes make it difficult to live life to the full, and can be a source of difficulties in relationships with others. There are currently few therapy options available for people living with dramatic weekly, daily or even hourly mood swings.The ThRIVe-B programme, carried out by researchers at the University of Exeter, involved taking an existing psychological therapy for another group of people that aims to help with emotion regulation, known as Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DPT), and adapting it for people who have these frequent Bipolar mood swings.DPT teaches skills both in acceptance of situations and emotional responses and is currently offered to people who have a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. We have psychological therapies that can be helpful for people with Bipolar but there s less available for people who have very frequent and ongoing mood swings within Bipolar  said lead author Dr Kim Wright, of the University of Exeter. We wanted to see how acceptable the therapy would be to the people who received it and do a test run to identify what changes need to be made before conducting a larger trial. The study took place in Devon and Cumbria and 43 participants were placed randomly into two groups.Half of the participants received the new therapy. The other half continued with their usual NHS care.The therapy lasted for around six months and participants were interviewed at various stages and asked to complete questionnaires when the study started and three, six, nine and 15 months later.Participants were invited to reflect upon their behavioural response to extreme mood and activation states day-to-day and modify this where necessary.In DPT this is achieved by building mindful awareness skills and through giving participants a framework through which to appraise their emotional responses and to develop alternative ways of relating to and managing these.The therapy involved attending 16 group sessions and also some individual sessions with a therapist.To support this, there was home practice as well as handouts and a ThrIVe-B smartphone app where participants could rate their mood. Because of the small numbers of people tested, the trial was never intended to evaluate the benefit of the treatment itself. Instead the study aimed to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of this therapy  Dr Wright explained. Overall, the study shows that there is demand from people with Bipolar for a psychological therapy addressing ongoing mood instability, and that a larger trial of a therapy like this is feasible. Our next steps will be to refine the therapy in line with what we learned from this study, such as simplifying content and considering individual rather than group delivery.

This is a condition that is caused by a single mutation in a single gene,  said senior author Larry Sherman, Ph.D., professor in the Division of Neuroscience at the primate center.  This really sets us up for the possibility of doing gene therapies, or neural stem cell-based therapies in the developing brain. Sherman said scientists at OHSU are already looking forward to collaborating with scientists who have developed experimental gene therapies in mice. The discovery of the genetic mutation in three young rhesus macaques provides the opportunity to apply therapies to an animal model that s much closer to humans.The study also included new findings revealing how Pelizaeus-Merzbacher and related diseases develop.The discovery came when veterinarians at the primate center noticed three young rhesus macaques displaying symptoms including tremors and motor dysfunction consistent with a loss of myelin, the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers in the central nervous system.That work was led by Anne Lewis, D.V.M., Ph.D., head of the pathology services unit at the primate center, who is corresponding author on the study along with Sherman.Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that the three animals were related to one another and that their parents carried a rare mutation of the PLP1 gene that causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.Affecting an estimated 1 in 100,000 people, it is a progressive, degenerative disease of the central nervous system with severity and onset that varies widely. Severe forms result in motor, sensory and cognitive deficits in infants that become progressively worse with age and are often fatal in childhood, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.The genomic database at the primate center made the discovery possible. In the past, it just wouldn t have been identified,  Sherman said.  Now we have this amazing ability to figure out the lineage of these animals and their genetic background. It marks the latest in a series of discoveries made possible by sequencing the genomes of nonhuman primates at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. It s known as the Macaque Genotype and Phenotype Resource, or mGAP.Co-author Betsy Ferguson, Ph.D., professor of genetics at the primate center and of molecular and medical genetics in the OHSU School of Medicine, initiated the database beginning in 2016 with a $4 million grant awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The grant allowed her to sequence the genomes of 2,000 rhesus macaques housed at the primate center, enabling researchers at OHSU and around the world to identify thousands of genetic variants that are identical to those known to cause human disorders.Advances in gene editing technology raise the possibility of new avenues to prevent and treat inherited disease. Ten years ago, our findings wouldn t have the same impact, because we didn t have the technology in place to address disease-causing mutations,  Ferguson said, describing the work in 2018.

Using standard silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the neuromorphic hardware is expected to reduce chip cost and simplify fabrication procedures.The research team led by Yang-Kyu Choi and Sung-Yool Choi produced a neurons and synapses based on single transistor for highly scalable neuromorphic hardware and showed the ability to recognize text and face images. This research was featured in Science Advances on August 4.Neuromorphic hardware has attracted a great deal of attention because of its artificial intelligence functions, but consuming ultra-low power of less than 20 watts by mimicking the human brain. To make neuromorphic hardware work, a neuron that generates a spike when integrating a certain signal, and a synapse remembering the connection between two neurons are necessary, just like the biological brain. However, since neurons and synapses constructed on digital or analog circuits occupy a large space, there is a limit in terms of hardware efficiency and costs. Since the human brain consists of about 1011 neurons and 1014 synapses, it is necessary to improve the hardware cost in order to apply it to mobile and IoT devices.To solve the problem, the research team mimicked the behavior of biological neurons and synapses with a single transistor, and co-integrated them onto an 8-inch wafer. The manufactured neuromorphic transistors have the same structure as the transistors for memory and logic that are currently mass-produced. In addition, the neuromorphic transistors proved for the first time that they can be implemented with a  Janus structure  that functions as both neuron and synapse, just like coins have heads and tails.Professor Yang-Kyu Choi said that this work can dramatically reduce the hardware cost by replacing the neurons and synapses that were based on complex digital and analog circuits with a single transistor. ""We have demonstrated that neurons and synapses can be implemented using a single transistor,"" said Joon-Kyu Han, the first author. ""By co-integrating single transistor neurons and synapses on the same wafer using a standard CMOS process, the hardware cost of the neuromorphic hardware has been improved, which will accelerate the commercialization of neuromorphic hardware,  Han added.Reference: Han J-K, Oh J, Yun G-J, et al.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as motor neurone disease, is a progressive fatal disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control, with patients become increasingly paralysed and losing the ability to speak, eat and breathe. A common occurrence, in 97% of ALS cases, is the abnormal accumulation of proteins involved in the regulation of RNA, called RNA binding proteins, from a motor neuron s nucleus into the surrounding cytoplasm. In a new study, published in Brain Communications today (6 August), the researchers used motor neurons grown in the lab from skin cells donated by patients with ALS and showed it is possible to reverse the incorrect localisation of three RNA binding proteins. The patients who donated cells all had mutations in an enzyme called VCP. This mutation is only present in a small proportion of ALS cases.*   They found that the abnormal location of these proteins can be caused when the VCP enzyme is mutated, which has been shown to increase its activity. Importantly, when the researchers blocked the activity of this enzyme in diseased cells, the distribution of proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm returned to normal levels. The inhibitor they used is similar to a drug which is currently being tested in phase II cancer trials and also blocks the activity of VCP. Demonstrating proof-of-concept for how a chemical can reverse one of the key hallmarks of ALS is incredibly exciting,  says Jasmine Harley, author and postdoctoral researcher in the Human Stem Cells and Neurodegeneration Laboratory at the Crick.  We showed this worked on three key RNA binding proteins, which is important as it suggests it could work on other disease phenotypes too. More research is needed to investigate this further. We need to see if this might reverse other pathological hallmarks of ALS and also, in other ALS disease models.  Work to try and understand the disease mechanisms of ALS is ongoing, as seen in a second study the same group recently published in Brain. The scientists investigated intron-retaining transcripts, sections of RNA that are usually cut out of the genetic sequence during a process known as splicing, which also move from the cell nucleus to cytoplasm in ALS. By analysing RNA in diseased motor neurons, they identified over 100 types of intron-retaining transcripts in the cytoplasm.Giulia Tyzack, author and project research scientist in the Human Stem Cells and Neurodegeneration Laboratory, says:  We were quite surprised about the number of different intron-retaining transcripts we found in cells with ALS, which exit the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm. We were not expecting to observe this to this degree. Jacob Neeves, author and scientist in the Human Stem Cells and Neurodegeneration Laboratory, adds:  To imagine what s going on here we can consider watching a movie at the cinema. Typically, we don t expect to see adverts throughout the film, but, if something goes wrong these ads might start cropping up at odd and unexpected points. These retained introns are a little bit like these abnormal ad breaks. The scientists suggest that the collection of intron-retaining transcripts in the cytoplasm may be a factor which attracts RNA binding proteins to move into the cytoplasm, although more research is needed to confirm this.  Rickie Patani, senior author, group leader of the Human Stem Cells and Neurodegeneration Laboratory at the Crick, Professor at UCL s Queen Square Institute of Neurology and a consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, says:  Together, our two papers show how laboratory science is furthering our understanding of such a complex and devastating disease and provides some reassurance that the development of effective treatments may be possible in the future.

Instead of elections, most offices   including those in the legislature, governing councils, and magistrates   were filled by citizen volunteers, selected by random lottery. These citizens  assemblies drafted, debated, and passed laws; made major foreign policy decisions; and controlled military budgets. Today, citizens  assemblies are making a comeback. In 2019 and 2020, citizens  assemblies in France and the UK convened to draft measures to address climate change. Citizens  assemblies in Ireland have led to changes to the Irish constitution which legalized abortion and same-sex marriage.One of the biggest challenges in organizing these assemblies   both in ancient times and today   is deciding who should serve. The assembly needs to be representative of the population as a whole. But selection should be random   ideally, with all volunteers having an equal chance of being chosen. To balance those two goals, the ancient Athenians used a rudimentary machine called a kleroterion, which randomly selected panels of volunteers from different tribes. Now, a team of computer scientists has devised a 21st century solution. Now, a team of computer scientists from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Carnegie Mellon University, in collaboration with a practitioner from and the Sortition Foundation, have designed an assembly selection process that satisfies representation and fairness simultaneously.This paper was published in Nature.  Ideally, a citizens  assembly acts as a microcosm of society,  said Ariel Procaccia, Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at SEAS and co-author of the study.  Whether this goal is realized in practice, however, depends on exactly how assembly members are chosen. First, we need to ask how do we even think about fairness in the context of panel selection, and then how do we formalize it in a way that means that everyone gets a fair chance,  said Bailey Flanigan, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author of the study. The research team examined a typical two-stage assembly selection process. In the first stage, thousands of randomly selected people are invited to participate. The final assembly is chosen from the pool of volunteers using a selection algorithm. However, the pool of volunteers tends to be unrepresentative of the population as a whole because certain groups, such as those with more education, are more likely to volunteer.  Giving all volunteers exactly equal probabilities is generally impossible to do while also satisfying demographic quotas,  said Paul G lz, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon and co-author of the paper.  Our selection algorithm finds a panel that satisfies quotas while giving potential participants as equal a chance as possible of being selected. It does this by computing a distribution over many panels, all of which satisfy the quota requirements, and then randomly drawing a panel from this distribution. A distribution of panels is then chosen in a way that the minimum probability of any volunteer appearing on the panel is as high as mathematically possible. This open-source algorithm has already been used to select more than 40 citizens  assemblies around the world, by organizations in countries including Denmark, Germany, the U.S., Belgium, and the UK. Procaccia, along with his co-authors and Gili Rusak of Stanford University, developed a website called Panelot.org, which makes their selection algorithm available free of charge. Going forward, the researchers will continue working with practitioners to learn from their experience about how these new selection algorithms can be made even more useful.  We are excited to explore new ways in which math and computer science can contribute to the practice of democracy,  said Procaccia.Reference: Flanigan B, G lz P, Gupta A, Hennig B, Procaccia AD.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-stress-hormones-influence-the-brain-351740,New Finding on How Stress Hormones Influence the Brain A new study by researchers at the University of Bristol has further explored how the stress hormone cortisol affects gene expression in the brain  with novel findings  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Chronic stress exerts its toll on the human body and mind, which can manifest as mental health conditions that may adversely affect quality of life. A thorough understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning stress responses in the brain is therefore crucial.   The experience of stress in the body is mediated by a number of different molecules, including the glucocorticoid hormones, or ""stress"" hormones, as they are sometimes referred to. In the brain, glucocorticoid hormones bind to specific receptors, including the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This binding action triggers a cascade of molecular events that includes changes to gene expression in specific regions of the brain.A new study by researchers at the University of Bristol has utilized next-generation sequencing, bioinformatic tools and pathway analysis to further explore the effect of MR- and GR-mediated gene activity in the hippocampus, a brain structure implicated in learning, memory and stress reactivity.The researchers discovered a novel link between MR and cilia, organelles that protrude from cell surfaces and act as ""antennas"" to the extracellular fluid surrounding them. While the role of cilia in the brain requires further elucidation, they are known to play a role in brain development and neuroplasticity via the transduction and regulation of different signaling pathways.The research carried out by the University of Bristol team reveals   for the first time   that cortisol-mediated activation of the MR influences ciliary genes, impacting the expression and function of the cilia. These findings enhance our knowledge of how stress impacts the brain and paves the way for further research into the potential role of ciliary genes in mental health disorders.Technology Networks spoke with Professor Hans Reul from Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences (THS) to learn more about this research and its potential applications. Reul also explains the human body's biological response to stressful stimuli and emphasizes why this work is ""state-of-the-art"".Molly Campbell (MC): For our readers that may be unfamiliar, please can you summarize the human body's biological response to stressful stimuli?Hans Reul (HR): A stressful event (for instance a dispute, an accident, loss of beloved friend or family member, being fired, etc.) elicits alarm reactions (i.e., the stress response) in our body. The body initiates the stress response in order to acutely cope with the challenge and adapt to it. There are fast responses, like the well-known fight or flight response evoked by adrenaline, and slower responses, mediated by the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol (corticosterone in rodents). Together, these hormones change metabolism, blood circulation, immune function and many other body functions to support coping with and adaptation to the stressful event. Furthermore, the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol plays an important role in how we deal mentally, i.e., in our brain, with the event. Making memories of the event is part of this process. This is important because in this way we learn how to deal with problems and respond better if a similar event would occur. Cortisol plays a critical role in the formation of memories of the event; memories like what happened, where did it happen, what time of the day and how did I feel, etc. The hormone does this by acting on neurons in the brain that play a role in learning and memory. The action is thought to involve changes in the activity of genes within these neurons. Until now, we did not know which kind of genes would be involved. Our study now, for the first time, provides an answer to this question.MC: What link exists between chronic stress and mental health disorders?HR: It has been known for a long time that chronic stress can lead to mental health disorders like major depression and anxiety. Also, for many years, it is thought that this involves the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol because, to put it simply, chronic stress leads to hypersecretion of cortisol and many patients suffering from major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, PTSD, schizophrenia or anxiety show disturbed cortisol secretion and function. Furthermore, successful antidepressant drug treatment has been shown to normalize glucocorticoid hormone function in depressed patients.MC: ""It is thought that genomic actions in the hippocampus underly the distinct roles of MR and GR in the control of circadian and stress-related physiology, cognition and behavior"". Please can you expand on this?HR: Glucocorticoid hormones, like cortisol in people and corticosterone in rodents, act by binding to two receptors, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Both receptors can be found in a limbic brain region called the hippocampus which is important for stress coping and learning and memory processes. As explained before, these hormones play an important in the physiological and mental/behavioural responses after stress. The hormones also show a circadian secretory pattern; in people, cortisol levels are higher in the morning when we start the day than in the evening when our rest/sleep period starts. With regard to their ""genomic actions"", I need to explain that MR and GR are predominantly intracellular receptors that can act as so-called transcription factors. This means that, after MR and GR have bound the hormone cortisol, they can bind directly to special recognition sites within genes or within the vicinity of genes and change the transcriptional activity of these genes, i.e., how much RNA is transcribed from these genes. Changes in the gene activity will lead to changes in the function of such neurons involved in the mental/cognitive/behavioural response to the stressful event.MC: You discovered a link between the MR and cilia function. Can you describe what cilia are, their role in the brain and what this link was?HR: One of the big discoveries in our paper is the link between MR and cilia function. Cilia are specialized cell organelles which look like protrusions from the cell body. In general, they play an important role in intracellular communication. Neurons have cilia as well. There is not so much known yet about their role in the brain. Cilia have been shown to be important for adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and certain hippocampus-associated behaviours. They also seem to be able sense changes in the flow of the extracellular fluid which encompasses neurons. Our works shows that MR interacts with many ciliary genes involved in cilia structure and function. This means that cortisol, via MR, can change the expression and function of cilia on neurons. Our work on the human foetal neural progenitor cells underlines the importance of MR for cilia expression on neurons. We show that when we block MR function at the start of neuronal differentiation, the cells do not express cilia and the differentiation process is stopped. So, the MR-cilia link is important for ciliogenesis and neuronal differentiation. These are important findings as not much is known about cilia function in the brain. There are mutations know in ciliary genes which lead to severe developmental problems including cognitive deficits. Ciliary genes could be involved in mental health (disorders), but we basically don t know yet.MC: Can you please summarize the key findings of your study?HR: There are several key findings to highlight. I think these are the most important ones:The discovery of the existence of a link between MR and cilia, as highlighted in the answer to your previous question. This was a fascinating and really unexpected finding! The link between MR and cilia seems to be really important for neuronal differentiation and development. Therefore, our results support a role of MR and cilia in brain development as well as adult neurogenesis. We hope this finding will trigger new research in these areas of neuroscience. Another main finding was that MR and GR interact with so-called neuroplasticity genes. Neuroplasticity is a term describing the ""changeability"" of the brain: our brain of now is different from the one a couple of seconds ago. In our brain, we make new connections (""synapses"") between our neurons and disrupt existing ones all the time and, in particular, after an event happens in our lives. After a stressful event, we need to cope with what has happened and, in part, this involves forming memories of the event so we can learn, for instance, to avoid certain situations or respond differently if a similar event would occur. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are abundantly secreted after stress, are well known to support this coping process including the formation of event-related memories. What we did not know is: how do these hormones do this? How are these hormones acting on neurons as part of this adaptive process? Our study discovered that glucocorticoid hormones via MR and GR interact with and stimulate the expression of many genes which are known to be involved in neuroplasticity. These genes, for instance, encode proteins known to play vital roles in the communication between neurons. It was just unknown, until now, that these genes are regulated by MR and GR, thus, providing a novel mechanism how glucocorticoid hormones support adaptation to stress at the molecular level. Our findings will, therefore, facilitate new research efforts into how we deal with stress. This is extremely important given the numbers of people suffering from stress-related mental health disorders like depression, anxiety and PTSD.This brings me to another key finding our study. We found that glucocorticoid hormones via MR and GR regulate many genes which are known to be ""vulnerability"" genes for mental health disorders like depression, anxiety and PTSD. The term vulnerability is largely based on studies in which small variations (singly nucleotide polymorphisms   SNPs; pronounced as ""snips"") in gene sequences were found to be associated with an increased chance of developing a mental health disorder. Given that glucocorticoid hormone dysfunction, as in chronic stress, is known to be a contributory factor in these disorders, our novel findings open the opportunity to study if aberrant regulation of these vulnerability genes by glucocorticoids could be an underpinning mechanism for developing such a disorder. Such research may lead to the identification of new drug targets for the treatment of severe mental health disorders like major depression, anxiety and PTSD. MC: Please can you discuss your choice of technologies for the study?HR: The two main technologies used are chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) and RNA analysis. For the genome-wide analyses these technologies were combined with next-generation sequencing. ChIP was used to investigate the interaction of MR and GR with their recognition sites within genes.We also used neurospheres formed by human foetal neural progenitor cells to investigate the role of MR in ciliogenesis and neuronal differentiation.MC: Are there any limitations that you wish to highlight?HR: The work in our study is state of the art. Nevertheless, science is never finished. Indeed, more work needs to be done. One step should be the translatability of our results to the human situation.MC: What are the key applications of this work, and what are your next research steps?HR: This is basic neuroscience research and cannot be immediately applied to clinical questions. However, there is a major interest from society in this research given the many people suffering from mental health disorders related to stress. Our research provides the many scientists working on stress-related mental health disorders important leads regarding the genes that may underpin the aetiology of these severe disorders.There are many research lines that could be pursued next. In the press release, we mention chronic stress, but aging, adolescence and embryonic/postnatal development are also very relevant conditions to look at as they involve phases of life sensitive to glucocorticoid hormones. As mentioned, it is really important that we have received a grant to study glucocorticoid hormone action in the female brain.

Sunburn is a major cause of premature ageing in skin, and a primary risk factor for skin cancer, and other skin problems associated with ageing. Now, an international research team has made inroads towards being able to reverse or delay this damage for the first time.The research was led by Professor Matt Whiteman at the University of Exeter Medical School, and Professor Uraiwan Panich at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, in Thailand. In the study published in Antioxidant and Redox Signaling, the team exposed adult human skin cells and the skin of mice to ultraviolet radiation (UVA). UVA is the part of natural sunlight which damages unprotected skin and can penetrate through windows, and even through some clothes. It causes skin to age prematurely by turning on skin digesting enzymes called collagenases. These enzymes eat away at the natural collagen, causing the skin to lose elasticity and sag, resulting in wrinkles. UVA also penetrates deeper into skin than the UV radiation that causes sunburns (UVB)-, and it damages cellular DNA, leading to mutations that can contribute to some skin cancers. Classic sun creams people use on holiday sit on top of the skin and absorb UV radiation, but they do not penetrate the skin where the long-lasting damage occurs.However, the team s research paves the way for a new way to protect the deeper layers of skin using two compounds invented at the University of Exeter: AP39 and AP123. In the experiments, the compounds did not protect the skin in the same way traditional sun creams prevent sunburn, but instead penetrated the skin to correct how skin cells  energy production and usage was turned off by UVA exposure. This then prevented the activation of skin-degrading collagenase enzymes and subsequent skin damage.The compounds used in this study were previously shown to have impressive effects in reducing skin inflammation and skin damage after burn injury and atopic dermatitis (eczema). In an anti-ageing context, they prevented human skin cells in test tube experiments from ageing, but this is the first time the effects of photo-ageing have been seen in animals.Professor Uraiwan Panich, of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, in Bangkok, a co-senior author on the paper, said:   The compounds AP39 and AP123 specifically target the energy generating machinery inside our cells, the mitochondria, and supply them with minute quantities of alternative fuel, hydrogen sulfide, to use when skin cells are stressed by UVA. The direct result of this was the activation of two protective mechanisms. One is a protein call PGC-1 , which controls mitochondria number inside cells and regulates energy balance. The other is Nrf2, which turns on a set of protective genes that mitigate UVA damage to skin and turn off the production of collagenase, the main enzyme that breaks down collagen in damaged skin tissue and causes skin to look significantly more  aged  .Professor Matt Whiteman, of the University of Exeter Medical School, a co-senior author on the paper added:  Some skin sun creams and cosmetics contain ingredients thought to protect mitochondria from UV radiation. However, it isn t clear that these cosmetic skin-applied substances get inside skin cells at all, whereas we found that our molecules penetrate cells and specifically target mitochondria where they are needed. By protecting mitochondria, we also preserve and upregulate the protective mechanisms by which mitochondria control inflammation, protect cells and prevent tissue destruction. Currently, we have no way of reversing or delaying skin ageing caused by sunlight exposure. Our results are a really exciting step towards that goal, and could one day help reduce age-related skin conditions, as well as be useful in other conditions resulting from the ageing process .The important observation noted was the compounds only regulated energy production, PGC-1  and Nrf2 in skin that was exposed to UVA. This suggests a novel approach to treating skin that has already been damaged by UV radiation, and could potentially reverse, as well as limit, that damage.While more research is now needed, long term implications of this work could be medical as well as cosmetic, where protecting skin from UV light is important. For example, not only premature skin ageing and skin cancers, but UV light allergies, solar urticaria (hives) and rare hereditary skin diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum, although further work is needed. The Exeter team are currently mid-way through testing newer and more potent molecules able to do the same task using newer approaches via the University of Exeter spin-out company MitoRx Therapeutics; a company developing highly potent mitochondrial drugs for clinical use.Reference: Lohakul J, Jeayeng S, Chaiprasongsuk A, et al.

To learn more about the biological basis of LSCC, a team led by researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the National Cancer Institute's Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), including collaborators from the Baylor College of Medicine, have developed the largest and most comprehensive molecular map to date of LSCC. Their effort, described in Cell, brings proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic data together into a detailed ""proteogenomic"" view of LSCC. Analysis of that data has revealed potential new drug targets, immune regulation pathways that might help the cancer evade immunotherapies, and even a new molecular subtype of LSCC.

This is shown in a new study published in Nature Climate Change. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, transports warm water masses from the tropics northward at the ocean surface and cold water southward at the ocean bottom, which is most relevant for the relatively mild temperatures in Europe. Further, it influences weather systems worldwide. A potential collapse of this ocean current system could therefore have severe consequences.  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning really is one of our planet s key circulation systems,  says the author of the study, Niklas Boers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Freie Universit t Berlin and Exeter University.  We already know from some computer simulations and from data from Earth s past, so-called paleoclimate proxy records, that the AMOC can exhibit   in addition to the currently attained strong mode   an alternative, substantially weaker mode of operation. This bi-stability implies that abrupt transitions between the two circulation modes are in principle possible. It has been shown previously that the AMOC is currently at its weakest in more than a 1000 years. However, so far it has remained an open question whether the observed weakening corresponds to a change in the mean circulation state, or whether it is associated with an actual loss of dynamical stability.  The difference is crucial , says Niklas Boers,  because the loss of dynamical stability would imply that the AMOC has approached its critical threshold, beyond which a substantial and in practice likely irreversible transition to the weak mode could occur.  Long-term observational data of the strength of the AMOC does unfortunately not exist, but the AMOC leaves so-called fingerprints in sea-surface temperature and salinity patterns of the Atlantic ocean.  A detailed analysis of these fingerprints in eight independent indices now suggests that the AMOC weakening during the last century is indeed likely to be associated with a loss of stability,  says Boers.  The findings support the assessment that the AMOC decline is not just a fluctuation or a linear response to increasing temperatures but likely means the approaching of a critical threshold beyond which the circulation system could collapse. A number of factors are likely important for the phenomenon   factors that add to the direct effect that the warming of the Atlantic ocean has on its circulation. These include freshwater inflow from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, melting sea-ice, increasing precipitation and river run-off. Freshwater is lighter than saltwater and reduces the tendency of the water to sink from the surface to greater depths, which is one of the drivers of the overturning.  I wouldn t have expected that the excessive amounts of freshwater added in the course of the last century would already produce such a response in the overturning circulation,  says Boers.  We urgently need to reconcile our models with the presented observational evidence to assess how far from or how close to its critical threshold the AMOC really is.  While the respective relevance of the different factors has to be further investigated, they re all linked to human-caused climate change.ReferenceBoers N.

The findings, published as the July cover article of Cell Systems, show the potential for AI-based tools to revolutionize pathology for cancer and a variety of other diseases. We now have a general framework that allows us to take tissue samples and predict mechanisms inside cells that drive disease, mechanisms that are currently inaccessible in any other way,  said study leader Gaudenz Danuser, Ph.D., Professor and Chair of the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics at UTSW.AI technology has significantly advanced over the past several years, Dr. Danuser explained, with deep learning-based methods able to distinguish minute differences in images that are essentially invisible to the human eye. Researchers have proposed using this latent information to look for differences in disease characteristics that could offer insight on prognoses or guide treatments. However, he said, the differences distinguished by AI are generally not interpretable in terms of specific cellular characteristics   a drawback that has made AI a tough sell for clinical use.To overcome this challenge, Dr. Danuser and his colleagues used AI to search for differences between images of melanoma cells with high and low metastatic potential   a characteristic that can mean life or death for patients with skin cancer   and then reverse-engineered their findings to figure out which features in these images were responsible for the differences.Using tumor samples from seven patients and available information on their disease progression, including metastasis, the researchers took videos of about 12,000 random cells living in petri dishes, generating about 1,700,000 raw images. The researchers then used an AI algorithm to pull 56 different abstract numerical features from these images.Dr. Danuser and his colleagues found one feature that was able to accurately discriminate between cells with high and low metastatic potential. By manipulating this abstract numerical feature, they produced artificial images that exaggerated visible characteristics inherent to metastasis that human eyes cannot detect, he added. The highly metastatic cells produced slightly more pseudopodial extensions   a type of fingerlike projection   and had increased light scattering, an effect that may be due to subtle rearrangements of cellular organelles.To further prove the utility of this tool, the researchers first classified the metastatic potential of cells from human melanomas that had been frozen and cultured in petri dishes for 30 years, and then implanted them into mice. Those predicted to be highly metastatic formed tumors that readily spread throughout the animals, while those predicted to have low metastatic potential spread little or not at all.Dr. Danuser, a Professor of Cell Biology and member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, noted that this method needs further study before it becomes part of clinical care. But eventually, he added, it may be possible to use AI to distinguish important features of cancers and other diseases.Reference: Zaritsky A, Jamieson AR, Welf ES, et al.

The research, just published in Nature Plants, could lead to a new sustainable pathway for making  p-hydroxybenzoic acid,  a chemical building block currently derived from fossil fuels, in plant biomass. P-hydroxybenzoic acid is a versatile chemical feedstock. It can serve as a building block for making liquid crystals, a plasticizer of nylon resin, a sensitizer for thermal paper, and a raw material for making paraben, dyes, and pigments,  said Chang-Jun Liu, a plant biochemist at the U.S. Department of Energy s Brookhaven National Laboratory and lead author on the paper.The global market value of p-hydroxybenzoic acid stood at U.S. $59 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $80 million by 2026. But the current process for making this important chemical relies on petrochemicals. Its synthesis requires harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and high pressure) and has negative environmental impacts. Finding an economical and sustainable way to make p-hydroxybenzoic acid in plants could help mitigate environmental impacts and contribute to an emerging bioeconomy.   We ve identified a key enzyme responsible for the synthesis and accumulation of p-hydroxybenzoate (pBA) the conjugate base of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in lignin, one of three major polymers that make up the structural support that surrounds plant cells,  said Liu.  This discovery may enable us to engineer plants to accumulate more of this chemical building block in their cell walls, thereby potentially adding value to the biomass. ","Published: August 6, 2021"

These plastics are ingested by aquatic and human organisms through water, food and the air we breathe. It is estimated that their size ranges from 0.1 microns to 5 millimeters and are made mainly of polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyamide and acrylics. Plastic particles the size of a micrometer are present literally everywhere: in the oceans, in the air, in the snow of the Himalayas, and even in human placentas. Toothpaste, sunscreens, common chemicals or packaging also contain plastics. And although studies indicate that the consumption of microplastics does not lead to death or immediate or food poisoning, there is growing evidence of its effects on cells at the molecular scale, which are difficult to identify experimentally.In this context, Vladimir Baulin, physicist and researcher in the Department of Physical and Inorganic Chemistry at the URV, in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Fleury, of the University of Saarland (Germany), has discovered in a recent study that microplastics can mechanically destabilize lipid membranes by adhering to and tightening them. The results of the study were published in the scientific journal PNAS. To test how the mechanical effect of microplastics on these membranes occurs, the researchers used a theoretical model that was later confirmed with experiments on the lipid bilayer (the barrier that protects the cell) with a special microfluidic device. Through this system they discovered the mechanism that enables the mechanical stretching of membranes to occur. Once this mechanism was identified, the researchers checked the findings in red blood cells trapped in a micropipette. The results of this experiment conclude that microplastics stretch the membranes of human red blood cells and greatly reduce their mechanical stability, which can affect their proper functioning and alter, for example, their ability to transport oxygen. The theoretical method, developed by URV physicist Vladimir Baulin, describes exactly how microplastics act on cell membranes. When tested, this model predicted that each particle would consume part of the membrane area, which induces it to contract around the plastic particles. This effect inevitably leads to a mechanical stretching of the cell membrane.  With this experiment we have shown that the theoretical model can even quantitatively predict the extent of the increase in cell membrane tension. This is an unexpected result given the model s simplicity,  explains Baulin. To confirm the model prediction, the microfluid technique was used in a simpler model than a human cell membrane, such as red blood cells, and the tension of these membranes in contact with microplastics was measured. The researchers found that plastic particles were never kept static in cells, but were constantly moved by continuous diffusion. Given these results, the researchers consider that this diffusion is the reason why this mechanical effect is maintained and prevents the mechanical relaxation of the cell. The researchers point out that this experimental test of the theoretical model allows conclusions to be drawn about the general validity of this mechanism, which can be transferred to a large number of human cells or organs.  The possible toxicity of microplastics in human cells is currently being discussed,  explains Jean-Baptiste Fleury, who is conducting research as an experimental physicist at the University of Saarland.  A priori, microplastics are not fatal immediately after ingestion into living organisms. However, it is increasingly recognized that microplastics can oxidize or stress cells through biological processes. The possibility of they may also stress a cell membrane through purely physical processes, however, is completely ignored by the vast majority of studies,  he adds. In fact, from a physical point of view, no effect should be expected. A cell membrane is considered as having properties similar to those of a liquid. It is known that any mechanical effect on a liquid disappears over time.  Surprisingly, however, we observe that the membranes of artificial cells and red blood cells stretch in the presence of microplastics,  he continues. According to the researcher, the membrane of human red blood cells apparently deforms spontaneously, which explains the massive effect that these microplastics have on cell membranes. This new line of research by Vladimir Baulin s group is dedicated to the microscopic mechanisms of pollution in the marine environment. The URV has for a few months now been promoting a new spin-off, DeepSea Numerical (https://deepsea.blue/), which aims to build a network of underwater laboratories so that research staff from around the world can come and conduct underwater experiments with the aim of monitoring and safeguarding biodiversity.ReferenceFleury J-B, Baulin VA.

Importantly, reduction of infection was obtained using concentrations of the drug which are safe and achievable using the standard clinical dose of fenofibrate.  Fenofibrate, which is approved for use by most countries in the world including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), is an oral drug currently used to treat conditions such as high levels of cholesterol and  lipids (fatty substances) in the blood.The team is now calling for clinical trials to test the drug in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, to be carried out in addition to two clinical trials also currently underway in such patients in research being led by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects the host through an interaction between the Spike protein on the surface of the virus and the ACE2 receptor protein on host cells.  In this study, responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the team tested a panel of already licensed drugs   including fenofibrate - to identify candidates that disrupt ACE2 and Spike interactions.  Having identified fenofibrate as a candidate, they then tested the efficacy of the drug in reducing infection in cells in the laboratory using the original strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated in 2020.  They found fenofibrate reduced infection by up to 70%.  Additional unpublished data also indicates that fenofibrate is equally effective against the newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 including the alpha and beta variants and research is ongoing into its efficacy in the delta variant.Corresponding author Dr Farhat Khanim, of the University of Birmingham in the UK, explained:  The development of new more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in a rapid expansion in infection rates and deaths in several countries around the world, especially the UK, US and Europe. Whilst vaccine programmes will hopefully reduce infection rates and virus spread in the longer term, there is still an urgent need to expand our arsenal of drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Co-corresponding author Dr Alan Richardson, of Keele University in the UK, added:  Whilst in some countries vaccination programmes are progressing at speed, vaccine uptake rates are variable and for most low middle income countries, significant proportions of the population are unlikely to be vaccinated until 2022. Furthermore, whilst vaccination has been shown to reduce infection rates and severity of disease, we are as yet unsure of the strength and duration of the response. Therapies are still urgently needed to manage COVID-19 patients who develop symptoms or require hospitalisation. Co-author Dr Elisa Vicenzi, of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy, said:  Our data indicates that fenofibrate may have the potential to reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and also virus spread. Given that fenofibrate is an oral drug which is very cheap and available worldwide, together with its extensive history of clinical use and its good safety profile, our data has global implications - especially in low-middle income countries and in those individuals for whom vaccines are not recommended or suitable such as children, those with hyper-immune disorders and those using immune-suppressants. First author Dr Scott Davies, also of the University of Birmingham, concluded:  We now urgently need further clinical studies to establish whether fenofibrate is a potential therapeutic agent to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study, published today (5 August 2021) in Genome Biology, provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of bacteria in the human microbiome. It may also inform the development of microbiome-based therapeutics where key bacteria could be selected to treat different intestinal-associated illnesses. Humans are populated by an extremely large amount of microorganisms, called a microbiome, which include bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi. Beneficial bacteria in the body roughly match human cells one to one* and in the gut, this collection of bacteria has been found to play an important role in human health. The makeup of the gut microbiome affects the immune system, prevents infections and supports the body by breaking down some carbohydrates that human cells cannot do alone. In order for bacterial species in the gut to survive, they have to be able to transmit from one person to another. Gut bacteria are mainly anaerobic, meaning they cannot survive in oxygen. To spread, some produce spores, which are sometimes likened to seeds and can lie dormant until they encounter the right conditions to grow. This research, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, investigated the group of bacteria known as the Firmicutes, which are dominant in the human microbiome and produce spores. The researchers analysed the genomes of 1,358 Firmicutes and tracked the evolution of certain characteristics, including spore production. They observed that gut bacteria that form spores were found at lower abundances in the gut, and had larger genomes compared to those that had lost the ability to produce spores (sporulate). Within their genomes, they also had more genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and vitamin biosynthesis, which suggests that they have important metabolic functions. Firmicutes bacteria that could no longer form spores had smaller genomes, but were present at higher abundances in the gut and had a more specialised metabolism based on genome analysis. They were also less prevalent in the general population, meaning they were found in a smaller number of individuals, suggesting loss of sporulation limits their ability to transmit widely. Smaller genomes and more specialised metabolism indicate that bacteria that have lost the ability to sporulate are becoming more adapted to their human host which could allow them to colonise to higher levels in the gut. On the other hand, bacteria that still produce spores appear less adapted to humans based on their larger genomes which could explain why they are not as abundant in the gut. These differences show that that transmission is an important process that shapes the evolution of gut bacteria and further research is now needed to continue to learn more about the link between transmission of gut bacteria and the roles they play in human health. Understanding these processes could help inform therapeutics, such as investigating whether specific bacteria could be given to people based on their ability to colonise and how the differing metabolism of these bacteria could impact health conditions and treatments.  Even though transmission of gut bacteria between humans is essential for their survival, the genetic and biological features of the bacteria that allows them to do this, is still poorly understood. This research starts to unravel some of this mystery by analysing the genomes and finding that the ability of bacteria to produce spores has been lost multiple times, impacting their evolution and function. It is necessary to continue looking at the genetic detail of the microbiome to help understand the roles of specific bacteria, and how lacking these might impact human health,  commented Dr Hilary Browne, first author and Staff Scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.  The microbiome plays an essential role in human health and development, and influences a wide range of physiological functions in the body. Understanding more about the bacteria that inhabit us and how they are adapted to living in humans through their metabolism will be important for the development of new therapeutics and diagnostics for microbiome-mediated diseases,  commented Dr Trevor Lawley, senior author and Senior Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.ReferenceBrowne H, et al.

As a result, testing typically takes at least one to two days.A research team led by scientists in the labs of Jennifer Doudna, David Savage and Patrick Hsu at the University of California, Berkeley, is aiming to develop a diagnostic test that is much faster and easier to deploy than qRT-PCR. It has now combined two different types of CRISPR enzymes to create an assay that can detect small amounts of viral RNA in less than an hour. Doudna shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for invention of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.While the new technique is not yet at the stage where it rivals the sensitivity of qRT-PCR, which can detect just a few copies of the virus per microliter of liquid, it is already able to pick up levels of viral RNA   about 30 copies per microliter   sufficient to be used to surveil the population and limit the spread of infections. You don t need the sensitivity of PCR to basically catch and diagnose COVID-19 in the community, if the test s convenient enough and fast enough,  said co-author David Savage, professor of molecular and cell biology.  Our hope was to drive the biochemistry as far as possible to the point where you could imagine a very convenient format in a setting where you can get tested every day, say, at the entrance to work. The researchers will report their results online August 5 in the journal Nature Chemical Biology.Several CRISPR-based assays have been authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, but all require an initial step in which the viral RNA is amplified so that the detection signal   which involves release of a fluorescent molecule that glows under blue light   is bright enough to see. While this initial amplification increases the test s sensitivity to a similar level as qRT-PCR, it also introduces steps that make the test more difficult to carry out outside of a laboratory.The UC Berkeley-led team sought to reach a useful sensitivity and speed without sacrificing the simplicity of the assay. For point of care applications, you want to have a rapid response so that people can quickly know if they re infected or not, before you get on a flight, for example, or go visit relatives,  said team leader Tina Liu, a research scientist in Doudna s lab at the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), a CRISPR-focused center involving UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco scientists.Aside from having an added step, another disadvantage of initial amplification is that, because it makes billions of copies of viral RNA, there is a greater chance of cross-contamination across patient samples. The new technique developed by the team flips this around and instead boosts the fluorescent signal, eliminating a major source of cross-contamination.The amplification-free technique, which they term Fast Integrated Nuclease Detection In Tandem (FIND-IT), could enable quick and inexpensive diagnostic tests for many other infectious diseases. While we did start this project for the express purpose of impacting COVID-19, I think this particular technique could be applicable to more than just this pandemic because, ultimately, CRISPR is programable,  Liu said.  So, you could load the CRISPR enzyme with a sequence targeting flu virus or HIV virus or any type of RNA virus, and the system has the potential to work in the same way. This paper really establishes that this biochemistry is a simpler way to detect RNA and has the capability to detect that RNA in a sensitive and fast time frame that could be amenable for future applications in point of care diagnostics. The researchers are currently in the process of building such a diagnostic using FIND-IT, which would include steps to collect and process samples and to run the assay on a compact microfluidic device.","Published: August 6, 2021"

Raspopovic spoke to Technology Networks just before his award was announced.The leg (pictured) aims to improve upon traditional prosthetics by increasing the felt sense of embodiment that users experience. Credit: Raspopovic labRaspopovic explains that previous eye-catching advances in robotics and mechanical design meant that the bottleneck in prosthesis innovation wasn t in how the device itself functioned, but how it connected to the brain:  We tried to design a device that would enable intuitive contact with the residual nervous system,  he says.  This is what patients want. They don t want a device that they have to train to use, they want to use it intuitively. His team created a bespoke approach for the design of neuroprostheses that is laid out in his essay. Rather than starting with an amputated limb, the team looked first at intact limbs, carefully studying the connections between brain and peripheral nerves This helped map out exactly which nerves contributed to normal gait and movement. This allowed them to very precisely design implanted electrodes to stimulate targeted areas of the nervous system. In doing so, they created a sensory experience for users of the prosthesis that naturally mimics the feeling of an intact leg. We managed to create a language of stimulation that is appropriate to speak to the nervous system. This took a decade of research in reality,  Raspopovic explains.The resulting  sensing leg  connects sensors in an artificial knee and foot to the residual peripheral nervous system. A wireless external controller device reads the pressure signals produced from the prosthesis and delivers a corresponding series of stimulations to the nerves of the user s residual leg.By running a delay that is imperceptible to the user, Raspopovic s leg recreates natural feelings of touch and pressure for the user. The study showed that the connection was so reliable that even when the leg was removed from the user, they could tell if the limb was touched in different places or flexed. Users  ability to navigate difficult terrain was also substantially improved. ","Published: August 5, 2021"

Using this approach, various forms of spatial and temporal information can be permanently stored for generations and retrieved by sequencing the cells  DNA.The new DNA writing technique, which the researchers call HiSCRIBE, is much more efficient than previously developed systems for editing DNA in bacteria, which had a success rate of only about 1 in 10,000 cells per generation. In a new study, the researchers demonstrated that this approach could be used for storing memory of cellular interactions or spatial location.This technique could also make it possible to selectively edit, activate, or silence genes in certain species of bacteria living in a natural community such as the human microbiome, the researchers say. With this new DNA writing system, we can precisely and efficiently edit bacterial genomes without the need for any form of selection, within complex bacterial ecosystems,  says Fahim Farzadfard, a former MIT postdoc and the lead author of the paper.  This enables us to perform genome editing and DNA writing outside of laboratory settings, whether to engineer bacteria, optimize traits of interest in situ, or study evolutionary dynamics and interactions in the bacterial populations. Timothy Lu, an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of biological engineering, is the senior author of the study, which appears today in Cell Systems. Nava Gharaei, a former graduate student at Harvard University, and Robert Citorik, a former MIT graduate student, are also authors of the study.","Published: August 5, 2021"

They also found that outfield players, particularly defenders, were more likely to have developed dementia than goalkeepers, whose risk was no different to non-players.What we know alreadyPreviously, in 2019, the research team from the University of Glasgow found former ex-professional footballers were 3.5 times more likely to die from dementia than their non-footballing counterparts.They also found these former pros, were less likely to die of heart disease and lung cancer but prescriptions of dementia-related medications were more common in former professionals compared to non-players. You can read the full findings here.Who did the researchers look at in this study?The team looked at the electronic health records of 7,676 male ex-professional football players in Scotland and compared them to 23,028 non-players of the same age, sex, and socio-demographic background. This was the same group of people they looked at in the previous study.A total of 386 of 7,676 former professional footballer developed a neurodegenerative disease. Whereas 366 of the 23,038 non-players developed the diseases.What did the researchers look for in this study and what did they find?The team looked to see whether player position affected the risk of neurodegenerative disease. Information on field position was available for 6622 former players. Goalkeepers weren t at any greater risk of neurodegenerative than non-players.They found that defenders were at most risk of neurodegenerative disease.The researchers also looked to see whether length of career affected the risk of neurodegenerative disease. They found that those with a career over 15 years had a greater risk of neurodegenerative disease than those of 5.Similar risks for neurodegenerative diseases remained for players born between 1910 and 1969.Dr Susan Kohlhaas, Director of Research at Alzheimer s Research UK, said: This well-conducted study of dementia risk in ex-professional footballers is another piece of a large and largely unfinished jigsaw when it comes to understanding dementia risk. Dementia risk is complex, caused by an interweaving mixture of age, genetics and lifestyle. This is interesting and useful insight into the difference in risk based on player positions and career length and could help inform future research or player management.  However, there is still more to do in order to fully understand what is causing increased dementia risk in outfield players. This study did not look at all aspect of players  lives on or off the pitch to determine what may be behind the increased risk. Existing results from this research team have shown that former professional footballers may also get several health benefits of playing the game and therefore it s important to understand both the benefits and risks of playing professional sport as it relates to dementia. Football is close to the hearts of so many of us, and it s right that authorities and footballing bodies take sensible steps to mitigate the risk of injury to ensure players can enjoy the game safely at all levels. It is good news that further guidance on heading will be introduced into the English game from next season, with all professional, amateur and grassroots clubs involved. As the UK s leading dementia research charity, Alzheimer s Research UK is committed to improving the understanding of the risk factors associated with dementia. The charity contributed to the Department of Media, Culture and Sports review into head injuries in sport, and our Chief Medical Officer sits on the advisory of the FA s independent medical advisory board. But with nearly one million people in the UK living with dementia, and a huge unmet clinical need, we need to see life-changing news treatments. We will continue to call on footballing bodies, player associations, and governments across the world to help fund dementia research now, not later, when it is too late. Life-changing research is the way to help find a cure. Reference: Russell ER, Mackay DF, Stewart K, MacLean JA, Pell JP, Stewart W.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/protein-that-enhances-physical-fitness-reduces-lifespan-351703,Protein That Enhances Physical Fitness Reduces Lifespan Researchers have added to evidence that a protein called CaMKII improves strength  endurance  muscle health and fitness in young animals  Their experiments also found that the gene for CaMKII also contributes to increased susceptibility to age associated diseases  frailty and mortality  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine say they have added to evidence that a protein called CaMKII improves strength, endurance, muscle health and fitness in young animals. Their experiments working with mice and fruit flies, however, found that the gene for CaMKII also contributes to an evolutionary tradeoff: increased susceptibility to age-associated diseases, frailty and mortality.The research, published May 26 in Nature Communications, indicates that future therapies targeting CaMKII could stave off diseases of old age, the investigators say.According to the study leaders, the evolutionary conservation of genes that enable the young to run faster and respond robustly to  fight or flight  responses makes sense: It helps them to catch prey or evade predators, thereby ensuring their reproductive success. However, some of these genes carry a steep price that animals need to pay when they grow older. The new research shows that turning on CaMKII through a chemical reaction caused by adding oxygen, known as oxidation, strengthens these survival responses for young animals. However, oxidative stress increases with aging, which leads to excessive activation of CaMKII. Elevated CaMKII activity has long been linked to tissue damage seen in heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cancer, lung and neurodegenerative diseases, says study co-lead Mark Anderson M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine and director of the department of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.In a bid to further explore oxidative stress and its links to aging and fitness, Anderson and his research team genetically engineered mice so their CaMKII is resistant to oxidation. They then used mouse-sized treadmills to compare the athletic performance of mice with and without CaMKII oxidation.They found that mice with oxidized CaMKII were able to run, on average, about 150 meters further and about 5 meters per minute faster than the mice with oxidation-resistant CaMKII.When the researchers biopsied muscle tissue from the mice and searched for other genes previously linked to muscle growth, recovery from exercise, improved blood flow and immune cell activation   factors that increase physical endurance   they found them activated only in mice with oxidizable CaMKII.Further experiments showed that CaMKII activity in the mouse muscle tissue increased the expression of cellular pathways related to inflammation, diabetes, enlarged heart, seizures and obesity.These experiments are further evidence that diseases of aging are natural tradeoffs built into our genetic makeup, says Qinchuan Wang, Ph.D., co-lead and assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  But they give us some hope that it may be possible to target this genetic architecture to combat age-related illnesses. The Johns Hopkins Medicine team also performed experiments in genetically modified fruit flies to see whether an oxidizable CaMKII produced similar performance and health effects in invertebrates, which do not naturally have an oxidation-sensitive CaMKII protein.The researchers used a gene-cutting and insertion tool called CRISPR to add the oxidation site to the CaMKII gene in fruit fly DNA.In one experiment, the flies were placed into glass tubes and allowed to climb to the top of the tube. The researchers found that flies genetically modified to have the oxidizable CaMKII climbed higher and 5mm per second faster than flies with the oxidation-resistant CaMKII. The result suggested that a physiological level of oxidative stress can enhance physical performance by oxidizing and activating CaMKII.When the researchers fed the flies an antioxidant diet to cancel out the oxidative stress effects on the modified CaMKII, flies with and without the genetic modification performed similarly in the climbing test.In another experiment, the researchers fed the flies a diet containing the herbicide paraquat, which overloads the flies with an excess of oxidants that activate CaMKII only in the genetically modified, but not the unmodified, flies. They found that the climbing performance of flies with the oxidant-resistant CaMKII gene was not affected by the paraquat diet, which was expected since there is no protein to activate.In contrast, under such an oxidative stress, the genetically modified flies with the oxidizable CaMKII suffered a significant reduction in climbing performance: They climbed almost 10mm per second slower than their counterparts fed normal diets, suggesting that excessive oxidative stress leads to physical decline through oxidizing and activating CaMKII.The researchers made similar observations in the fly hearts. They found that the hearts of flies with the oxidizable CaMKII contracted more forcefully and relaxed more quickly than flies with oxidation-resistant CaMKII. However, the performance advantage of the hearts in the genetically modified flies was reversed when the researchers neutralized the oxidants with an antioxidant. The researchers also found that the hearts of the genetically modified flies are more vulnerable to damaging effects of excessive oxidant, as they became dysfunctional or stopped beating altogether when treated by paraquat, the oxidant-generating chemical.The most striking finding, says Wang, was that despite having better physical performance and cardiac function, the genetically modified flies experienced a more rapid age-related decline and they died at a younger age. A main role of evolution is to improve the ability to carry on the species, including producing more offspring and being adept at finding food. Our findings affirm that improvements in the longevity or lifespan of a species is not always necessary for this to happen,  explains Gabriel Bever, Ph.D., associate professor of Functional Anatomy and Evolution at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a collaborator on the study.  In fact, some of the very adaptations that make a species successful also contribute to aging and age-associated diseases. Overall, the researchers say these findings may provide new targets to address diseases related to an abundance of oxidative damage and may also provide an explanation for why studies of broad spectrum antioxidants, such as Vitamins C and E, have yielded mixed results in the treatment of heart diseases, Parkinson s disease and Huntington s disease.The scientists say that designing treatments to specifically target gene regulators such as CaMKII may work better. For hundreds of millions of years, these diseases have been programmed into animal genomes to plague us at the end of our lives,  says Bever.  It s evident we need a more complete understanding of their evolutionary roots if we ever hope to find cures. The researchers found additional evidence that CaMKII activates genes associated with early immune responses, an adaptation of early vertebrates that confers fitness by helping to ward off infectious diseases. Scientists have found that when people get older, abnormal activation of the immune system contributes to systemic and chronic inflammation and increases the risk for all major age-related diseases. ""CaMKII's ability to activate immune response in the face of oxidative stress may hold the clue for its involvement in aging and disease,  says Wang.Reference: Wang Q, Hern ndez-Ochoa EO, Viswanathan MC, et al.

We need only three receptors in our eyes to sense all the colors of the rainbow that s because different hues emerge as light-waves that vary across just one dimension, their frequency. The vibrant colorful world, however, pales in comparison to the complexity of the chemical world, with its many millions of odors, each composed of hundreds of molecules, all varying greatly in shape, size and properties. The smell of coffee, for instance, emerges from a combination of more than 200 chemical components, each of which are structurally diverse, and none of which actually smells like coffee on its own. The olfactory system has to recognize a vast number of molecules with only a few hundred odor receptors or even less,  says Rockefeller neuroscientist Vanessa Ruta.  It s clear that it had to evolve a different kind of logic than other sensory systems. In a new study, Ruta and her colleagues offer answers to the decades-old question of odor recognition by providing the first-ever molecular views of an olfactory receptor at work.The findings, published in Nature, reveal that olfactory receptors indeed follow a logic rarely seen in other receptors of the nervous system. While most receptors are precisely shaped to pair with only a few select molecules in a lock-and-key fashion, most olfactory receptors each bind to a large number of different molecules. Their promiscuity in pairing with a variety of odors allows each receptor to respond to many chemical components. From there, the brain can figure out the odor by considering the activation pattern of combinations of receptors. This article has been republished from the following materials.

This is the first time that an entire brain s structure is deduced and compared across developmental stages, from birth to adulthood,  said Dr. Mei Zhen, a senior investigator at the LTRI.  These new findings have powerful implications for the fundamental rules that allow the brain s developmental maturation to take place. Zhen and her colleagues used state-of-art electron microscopes to reconstruct the full brain of eight C. elegans individuals to learn how it changes with age. Although C. elegans is a relatively simple organism, many of the molecular signals controlling its development are also found in more complex organisms, like humans. They also have a short life cycle of only two weeks, making it useful for studying their development. We examined every connection for every neuron and found many new connections are added as animals grow older,  said Dr. Zhen.  When we analyzed these connections like wires in a computational network, we discovered the new additions follow patterns and their collective changes serve one purpose -- effective information processing. The first wiring map of C. elegans was generated by John White and his colleagues at MRC Cambridge more than 30 years ago, and it was a composite of partial maps from several different worms, including some at different developmental ages.Dr. Daniel Witvliet, a former PhD student in the Zhen lab at the LTRI, led the current study, alongside scientists from Harvard s Brain Institute, including Drs. Aravi Samuel and Jeff Lichtman.The researchers looked at how the worm s brain structure changed both at single synapse resolution and at the geometry level as a whole, discovering that a few structural properties in the newborn s brain allow them to correctly predict the wiring patterns of the mature brain.  Our research shows that different parts of the brain have different degrees of flexibility,  Dr. Zhen said.  Knowing which part of the brain has more plasticity can help scientists come up with strategies to overcome genetic vulnerabilities to diseases during the brain s development. We are humbled by and proud to continue the legacy from our scientific pioneers. While identifying some key patterns of the brain s development, researchers also discovered substantial connectivity differences that make each brain unique.Dr. Zhen said they noticed consistent wiring changes between different neurons, where each change altered the strength of existing connections and in turn created new connections, ultimately altering how information was being processed. Over the course of development, researchers found their central decision-making circuitry was maintained, where its sensory and motor pathways were substantially remodelled.Reference: Witvliet D, Mulcahy B, Mitchell JK, et al.

The near-atomic-level structural analysis provides guidance for the development of future vaccines and therapeutics that may work against a wide variety of coronaviruses including variants not yet in circulation.  This is the first time anyone has systematically classified ultrapotent nanobodies based on their structure,  said senior author Yi Shi, Ph.D., assistant professor of cell biology at Pitt.  By doing this, we ve not only provided details on the mechanisms our nanobodies use to defeat SARS-CoV-2, but also revealed directions for how to design future therapeutics.  Late last year, Shi and his team announced that they d extracted tiny, but extremely powerful, SARS-CoV-2 antibody fragments from llamas, which could be fashioned into inhalable therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19. Since then, preclinical studies have verified that the potent nanobodies prevent and treat severe COVID-19 in hamsters, reducing virus particles in their respiratory tracts by a million-fold compared to placebo. In this latest study, Shi partnered with Pitt structural biologists Cheng Zhang, Ph.D., and James Conway, Ph.D., as well as pharmacologists, structural biologists and biochemists at Case Western Reserve, to use high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy to observe exactly how the nanobodies interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to stop it from infecting cells and discover how mutations found in variants may affect nanobody interactions.  Cryoelectron microscopy has been demonstrated many times to be an extremely useful tool to see high-resolution structural information,  said co-senior author Wei Huang, Ph.D., research scientist in the Department of Pharmacology at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine.  And nanobodies are versatile and stable biologics that can be used in other research, such as cancer.  The team selected eight potent nanobodies for further examination. First, they confirmed through observations that several of the nanobodies work against Alpha (a variant associated with the U.K.), Delta (which is associated with India) and several other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. They also classified the nanobodies into three main groups based on how they interact with the spike proteins, which are the protrusions that encircle the spherical coronavirus and act as  keys  that grant the virus entry to human cells: - Class I outcompetes the part of the human cell that the spike protein binds to, preventing the virus from gaining entry to cells. - Class II binds to a region on the spike protein that has persisted through several permutations of coronaviruses including the original SARS-CoV-1. This means it may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, but also other coronaviruses. - Class III latches on to a specific region of the spike protein that larger antibodies cannot access. By binding to this area, the nanobody prevents the protein from folding in the way it needs to for entry into human cells.  Describing all these vulnerabilities and ways to thwart SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses in general has huge potential,  said Shi.  It will not only help our team select and refine nanobodies to treat and prevent COVID-19, but it also may lead to a universal vaccine, preventing not just COVID-19, but SARS, MERS and other diseases caused by coronaviruses.

The science is rapidly advancing in the area of epigenetics modifications to our DNA that are often environmentally driven and have the potential to serve as early warning sign for disease,  says Ana Navas-Acien, MD, PhD, the study s first author and professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.  In this study, we harness the country s best clinical data on heart disease from diverse populations to begin to unlock the specific epigenetic changes involved in the complex biology that leads to disease. Ultimately, we hope the research will allow us to identify and prevent disease before the worst damage takes place, although developing appropriate DNA methylation tests is still years away. The researchers began their analysis with data from the Strong Heart Study, the largest study of cardiovascular disease in American Indians, conducted in partnership with communities across the Great Plains and the Southwest since 1988. They analyzed blood samples to identify specific locations on DNA where methylation activity was associated with incidents of coronary heart disease, including heart attack and coronary deaths (methylation can change the activity of a DNA segment without changing the genetic sequence). The use of high-dimensional statistical methods allowed us to study methylation in hundreds of thousands of specific locations in the DNA at the same time  says Arce Domingo-Relloso, MSc, a data scientist at the Columbia Mailman School and the study co-author leading the statistical analyses for the project. The researchers then took the same approach with four other major heart disease cohorts: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (divided into Black and white cohorts due to differences in timing and laboratory methods), Framingham Heart Study, and Women s Health Initiative. In all, they examined more than 400,000 DNA locations and 1,894 coronary heart disease events.In the initial analysis of Strong Heart data, they identified 506 epigenetic marks linked to cardiovascular risk. Of these, 33 were also linked to cardiovascular risk in three or more of the other cohorts, although some of these sites were associated with higher risk of disease in one cohort but with lower risk of disease in other cohorts. Among the 33 methylation sites are those previously linked to cardiovascular risk and smoking, as well as novel sites that the researchers say are worthy of future investigation. Further analysis of the commonalities between the 33 marks found that many of them are connected with the EGFR gene, which is involved in cell growth and cell survival. The overlap of these methylation sites across diverse cohorts supports the idea of interconnected biological pathways for cardiovascular risk,  says Yuling Hong, MD, PhD, chief of the epidemiology branch within the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.  The more we understand about early risk for cardiovascular disease the better we may be able to prevent illness, particularly in populations such as American Indians with relatively high risk for heart disease.

Inhibiting this protein effectively destroys cancer cells in laboratory models, including in cell lines and mice, while leaving healthy cells unharmed.The research, published today (4 August 2021) in Molecular Cell, provides strong evidence that developing drugs that block the RNA-modifying protein known as METTL1 could give people with aggressive brain, blood, skin, and kidney cancers new treatment options.RNA-modifying proteins, in particular the METTL family, are involved heavily in cell replication. These proteins have been found in higher levels in certain cancer cells, including some brain, blood, pancreatic, and skin cancers, and are associated with poorer outcomes*. Previously, Dr Tzelepis, along with his team at the University of Cambridge, and their collaborators at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, used CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to screen cancer cells for vulnerable points. The researchers identified the METTL1 gene   a gene that produces the RNA-modifying METTL1 protein   as a target for drug development**.In a new study that builds on that research, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, University of Cambridge, and Harvard University have now found that mutations in the METTL1 gene which lead to higher levels of the METTL1 protein, cause the cells to replicate faster and transform into a cancerous state, producing highly aggressive tumours.When the team inhibited the METTL1 protein by knocking out the gene, it stopped cancer cell growth while leaving the normal healthy cells unharmed, in both laboratory and mice models, suggesting it would be a good target for cancer treatments.Recently, the team also developed a small-molecule inhibitor for a similar protein, METTL3, to help treat acute myeloid leukaemia, which will be entering clinical trials in 2022. It is hoped that this new research provides the evidence needed to start to develop a similar drug that targets METTL1, which could be used to treat a wider range of aggressive cancers if they have a mutation in the METTL1 gene or high levels of its protein.As the METTL1 protein is elevated in cancer cells with poorer outcomes, it could also be used as a biomarker to inform treatment plans and identify those who would benefit if a drug was developed, to ensure clinical trials are as streamlined and personalised as possible.Professor Richard Gregory, co-lead author and Principle Investigator at Boston Children s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, said:  Cancer cells benefit from an unregulated cell cycle, leading to increased replication, and while some of the reasons behind this are known, there is still a lot to discover. This research illuminates deeply the role of the METTL1 protein in cancer development and proves that mutations in this gene can cause a cell to become cancerous. The more we understand about the genetic basis of cancer and how we can combat this, the more life changing targeted treatments we can create. Dr Esteban Orellana, first author and Research Fellow at Boston Children s Hospital, said:  Our research gives incredibly strong evidence that targeting the RNA modifying protein, METTL1, is an effective treatment against certain cancers, helping to kill cancer cells while leaving the other cells in the body untouched. This is important as it could mean that there will be fewer unpleasant side effects of a potential new treatment. The next step for this research is to try and develop a small molecule inhibitor to block METTL1 to see if our encouraging results can be translated across to the clinic. Dr Konstantinos Tzelepis, co-lead author, group leader at the University of Cambridge and visiting scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute said:  This study provides another great example of what is possible with the use of CRISPR technologies and how we can take and prioritise precise genetic information and turn it into something of potential clinical benefit. Targeting RNA-modifying proteins can effectively destroy cancer cells and we hope that this research will provide the evidence necessary for drugs to be developed that target METTL1, potentially providing a new therapy against aggressive cancers with clear and unmet therapeutic need.

Now, researchers reporting in ACS Infectious Diseases have shown that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 also show breath metabolite changes, but they re largely different from the ones in adults. Someday, this information could be used to quickly and easily screen children for infection, the researchers say.Currently, COVID-19 is diagnosed through the detection of specific viral nucleic acids or antigens, but these techniques are slow, relatively expensive, sometimes uncomfortable and prone to false-negative results. Scientists have observed that dogs can detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human biological samples and distinguish certain diseases, including COVID-19. Researchers have also developed a sensor array to detect COVID-19-related VOCs in the exhaled breath of adults. Audrey Odom John and colleagues wondered if children infected with SARS-CoV-2 would also show changes in breath metabolites. If so, a breathalyzer-type device might someday quickly and comfortably screen large numbers of children in settings such as schools.The researchers collected breath samples from children who were given routine COVID-19 tests prior to being admitted to the Children s Hospital of Pennsylvania for other conditions. Fifteen children were SARS-CoV-2 negative, whereas 10 tested positive. The team analyzed 84 VOCs in the breath samples by 2D gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, identifying six candidate biomarkers that were significantly elevated in the breath of children with COVID-19. Two of these markers (octanal and heptanal) were also elevated in the breath of adults with the disease, while the others were unique to infected children. Then, the researchers measured these VOCs in breath samples from a different group of 24 children, half of whom were positive for the disease. The six biomarkers could predict infection with 91% sensitivity and 75% specificity. These preliminary results suggest that breathalyzer testing could be an inexpensive, noninvasive, quick and sensitive alternative for the frequent screening of large numbers of children, the researchers say. Those who test positive could then be given more specific, nucleic-acid based tests to confirm the screening results.Reference: Berna AZ, Akaho EH, Harris RM, et al.

One found eating a plant-centered diet in young adulthood lowered the risk in middle age for heart attack, stroke, heart failure and several other cardiovascular conditions. A second found eating plant-based foods that lower cholesterol levels reduced the risk of heart disease in postmenopausal women. While the research underscores the importance of eating more fruits and vegetables, it doesn't suggest strict vegetarianism is necessary to reap heart-healthy benefits. ""People can choose among plant foods that are as close to natural as possible, not highly processed,"" lead author of the young adult study, Yuni Choi, said in a news release. Choi is a postdoctoral researcher in the division of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis. ""We think that individuals can include animal products in moderation from time to time, such as non-fried poultry, non-fried fish, eggs and low-fat dairy."" Choi and her team analyzed diet and cardiovascular disease occurrence in 4,946 adults, ages 18 to 30, enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Information about participants' diets was collected through interviews, and they were not told what to eat. Based on what is known about their link to cardiovascular disease risk, foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and whole grains were considered beneficial, while those such as fried potatoes, high-fat red meat, salty snacks, pastries and soft drinks were considered adverse. Neutral foods included refined grains, lean meats and shellfish. Those who ate a more beneficial, plant-centered diet, with fewer foods considered adverse, were 52% less likely to develop cardiovascular disease during about 30 years of follow-up. Those whose diets improved the most as they got older were 61% less likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those whose diets worsened the most. ""Earlier research was focused on single nutrients or single foods, yet there is little data about a plant-centered diet and the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease,"" Choi said. In a separate study, researchers analyzed the diets of 123,330 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative who were scored on their adherence to eating foods considered part of the ""Portfolio Diet,"" already known to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The diet includes nuts; plant protein from soy, beans or tofu; viscous soluble fiber from oats, barley, okra, eggplant, oranges, apples and berries; plant sterols from enriched foods and monounsaturated fats found in olive oil, canola oil and avocado. It also allows a limited amount of saturated fats and dietary cholesterol. The women, who were between 50 and 79 when they enrolled in the study, were followed for 15 years. Postmenopausal women who ate the most of these foods were 11% less likely to develop cardiovascular disease of any kind and 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease, in which plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries leading to the heart. They were 17% less likely to develop heart failure, which occurs when the heart can't pump blood as well as it should. The diet didn't appear to affect stroke risk. ""We also found a dose response in our study, meaning that you can start small, adding one component of the Portfolio Diet at a time, and gain more heart-health benefits as you add more components,"" lead author Andrea J. Glenn said in the release. Glenn is a registered dietitian and doctoral student in nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto. The study's senior author, Dr. John Sievenpiper, said in the release that ""with even greater adherence to the Portfolio dietary pattern, one would expect an association with even less cardiovascular events, perhaps as much as cholesterol-lowering medications."" Sievenpiper is an associate professor of nutritional sciences and medicine at the University of Toronto. ""Still,"" he said, ""an 11% reduction is clinically meaningful and would meet anyone's minimum threshold for a benefit.""ReferencesChoi Y, Larson N, Steffen LM, et al.

Additionally, in mice, they have successfully manipulated several key genes associated with these variants to extend their reproductive lifespan.Their findings, published today in Nature, substantially increase our knowledge of the reproductive ageing process, as well as providing ways to improve the prediction of which women might reach menopause earlier than others.While life expectancy has increased dramatically over the past 150 years, the age at which most women go through natural menopause has remained relatively constant at about 50 years old. Women are born with all the eggs they will ever carry, and these are gradually lost with age. Menopause occurs once most of the eggs have gone, however natural fertility declines substantially earlier.Co-author Professor Eva Hoffmann, of the University of Copenhagen, said:  It is clear that repairing damaged DNA in eggs is very important for establishing the pool of eggs women are born with and also for how quickly they are lost throughout life. Improved understanding of the biological processes involved in reproductive ageing could lead to improvements in fertility treatment options. This research has been achieved by a global collaboration involving academics from more than 180 institutions, and jointly led by the University of Exeter, the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, the Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine at the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona, and the DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability at the University of Copenhagen. Their findings identify new genetic variations linked to reproductive lifespan, increasing the number known from 56 to 290.The new discoveries were made possible through analyses of datasets from hundreds of thousands of women from many studies including UK Biobank and 23andMe. Data from 23andMe was provided by customers who have opted-in to participate in research. While the large majority are from women of European ancestry, they also examined data on nearly 80,000 women of East Asian ancestry, and found broadly similar results.The team discovered that many of the genes involved are linked to processes of DNA repair. They also found that many of these genes are active from before birth, when human egg stores are created, but also throughout life as well. Notable examples are genes from two cell cycle checkpoint pathways   CHEK1 and CHEK2 - which regulate a broad variety of DNA repair processes. Knocking out a specific gene (CHEK2) so that it no longer functions, and over-expressing another (CHEK1) to enhance its activity each led to an approximately 25 per cent longer reproductive lifespan in mice. Mouse reproductive physiology differs from humans in key ways, including that mice do not have menopause. However, the study also looked at women who naturally lack an active CHEK2 gene, and found they reach menopause on average 3.5 years later than women with a normally active gene.Co-author Professor Ignasi Roig, from the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona, said: We saw that two of the genes which produce proteins involved in repairing damaged DNA work in opposite ways with respect to reproduction in mice. Female mice with more of the CHEK1 protein are born with more eggs and they take longer to deplete naturally, so reproductive lifespan is extended. However, while the second gene, CHEK2, has a similar effect, allowing eggs to survive longer, but in this case the gene has been knocked out so that no protein is produced suggesting that CHEK2 activation may cause egg death in adult mice .The genes identified by this work influence the age at natural menopause and can also be used to help predict which women are at highest risk of having menopause at a young age.Co-author Dr Katherine Ruth, of the University of Exeter, said:  We hope our work will help provide new possibilities to help women plan for the future. By finding many more of the genetic causes of variability in the timing of menopause, we have shown that we can start to predict which women might have earlier menopause and therefore struggle to get pregnant naturally. And because we are born with our genetic variations, we could offer this advice to young women. The team also examined the health impacts of having an earlier or later menopause by using an approach that tests the effect of naturally-occurring genetic differences. They found that a genetically earlier menopause increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and is linked to poorer bone health and increased risk of fractures. However, it decreases the risk of some types of cancer, such as ovarian and breast cancer, that are known to be sensitive to sex hormones which are at higher levels while a woman is still menstruating.Reference: Ruth KS, Day FR, Hussain J, et al.

The increased cytokine production causes other endothelial cells to express more cell surface adhesion molecules, making them more attractive to the circulating tumour cells and thus potentially promoting metastasis.In an earlier study, Corresponding Author Professor Lu-Gang Yu and colleagues reported that circulating PNA binds to a special sugar chain, which occurs mainly on pre-cancerous and cancer cells, and interacts with a larger protein expressed on the surface of tumour cells in the bloodstream.This interaction triggers changes in the larger protein, resulting in underlying adhesion molecules on the surface of the cancer cell to become exposed, making the cancer cells stickier and easier to attach themselves to the blood vessels. It also allows the cancer cells to form small clumps that prolong the survival of cancer cells in the body s circulation. Many epithelial cancers spread to the other organs through traveling through the bloodstream.Professor Lugang Yu said: Although further research and investigation are still needed, these studies suggest that very frequent consumption of peanuts by cancer patients might increase the risk of metastatic spread.""Reassuringly though, a large US study reported no significant impact of peanut consumption on cancer mortality. In another study, peanut consumption was reported to have no significant effect on prognosis in men with established prostate cancer. In our previous healthy volunteer study, substantial blood concentrations of PNA were only seen transiently one hour or so after consumption of a large dose (250g) of peanuts, so it may be that  normal  peanut consumption yielding lower PNA concentrations is harmless. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that circulating PNA, at least at the relatively high levels found shortly after a large  dose  of peanuts, could have a significant biological effect on tumour cells circulating at that time, with a potential for increased risk of metastasis.  Heavy or very frequent peanut consumption therefore might be better avoided by cancer patients. The possible impact of heavy peanut consumption by cancer patients on survival will need to be investigated in further population-based epidemiological studies.Reference: Wang W, Sindrewicz-Goral P, Chen C, et al.

We found that an increase of 1 microgram per cubic meter of exposure corresponded to a 16% greater hazard of all-cause dementia. There was a similar association for Alzheimer s-type dementia,  said lead author Rachel Shaffer, who conducted the research as a doctoral student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences.  The ACT Study is committed to advancing dementia research by sharing its data and resources, and we re grateful to the ACT volunteers who have devoted years of their lives to supporting our efforts, including their enthusiastic participation in this important research on air pollution,  said Dr. Eric Larson, ACT s founding principal investigator and a senior investigator at KPWHRI.The study, published Aug. 4 in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, looked at more than 4,000 Seattle-area residents enrolled in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) Study run by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in collaboration with UW. Of those residents, the researchers identified more than 1,000 people who had been diagnosed with dementia at some point since the ACT Study began in 1994. Once a patient with dementia was identified, researchers compared the average pollution exposure of each participant leading up to the age at which the dementia patient was diagnosed. For instance, if a person was diagnosed with dementia at 72 years old, the researchers compared the pollution exposure of other participants over the decade prior to when each one reached 72. In these analyses, the researchers also had to account for the different years in which these individuals were enrolled in the study, since air pollution has dropped dramatically in the decades since the ACT study began.In their final analysis, the researchers found that just a 1 microgram per cubic meter difference between residences was associated with 16% higher incidence of dementia. To put that difference into perspective, Shaffer said, in 2019 there was approximately 1 microgram per cubic meter difference in PM2.5 pollution between Pike Street Market in downtown Seattle and the residential areas around Discovery Park.  We know dementia develops over a long period of time. It takes years - evendecades - for these pathologies to develop in the brain, and so we needed to look at exposures that covered that extended period,  Shaffer said. And, because of long-running efforts by many UW faculty and others to build detailed databases of air pollution in our region,  we had the ability to estimate exposures for 40 years in this region. That is unprecedented in this research area and a unique aspect of our study. In addition to extensive air pollution and dementia data for the region, other study strengths included lengthy address histories and high-quality procedures for dementia diagnoses for the ACT Study participants.   Having reliable address histories let us obtain more precise air pollution estimates for study participants,  said senior author Lianne Sheppard, a UW professor of environmental and occupational health sciences and of biostatistics.  These high-quality exposures combined with ACT s regular participant follow-up and standardized diagnostic procedures contribute to this study s potential policy impact.  While there are many factors such as diet, exercise and genetics associated with the increased risk of developing dementia, air pollution is now recognized to be among the key potentially modifiable risk factors. The new UW-led results add to this body of evidence suggesting air pollution has neurodegenerative effects and that reducing people s exposure to air pollution could help reduce the burden of dementia.  How we ve understood the role of air pollution exposure on health has evolved from first thinking it was pretty much limited to respiratory problems, then that it also has cardiovascular effects, and now there s evidence of its effects on the brain,  said Sheppard, who this year was awarded the Rohm & Haas Endowed Professorship of Public Health Sciences. Over an entire population, a large number of people are exposed. So, even a small change in relative risk ends up being important on a population scale,  Shaffer said.  There are some things that individuals can do, such as mask-wearing, which is becoming more normalized now because of COVID. But it is not fair to put the burden on individuals alone. These data can support further policy action on the local and national level to control sources of particulate air pollution. Reference: Shaffer RM, Blanco MN, Li G, et al.

But radiation detectors, which go under the body part being imaged, are rigid panels that contain harmful heavy metals, such as lead and cadmium. Now, researchers in ACS  Nano Letters report a proof-of-concept wearable X-ray detector prepared from nontoxic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) layered between flexible plastic and gold electrodes for high-sensitivity sensing and imaging.Most X-ray detectors are integrated into big, immobile instruments, such as computerized tomography (known as CT) and mammography equipment, or are stiff, like the sharp-edged bitewing detectors used in dental offices. Detectors that could conform to rounded body parts or mold to the inside of confined spaces could be beneficial in some radiation monitoring and medical imaging applications. Previous researchers have used MOFs for flexible radiation detectors because they are semiconducting materials that respond to electromagnetic radiation by creating an electrical current. However, some of these MOFs still include lead, just like the X-ray detectors that are currently in use. So, Shuquan Chang, Shenqiang Ren and colleagues wanted to create a heavy-metal-free MOF for a flexible X-ray detector and imager. The researchers mixed a solution of nickel chloride salt and 2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-dithiol (DABDT) for several hours, creating a MOF in which nickel linked the DABDT molecules. In initial tests, the nickel-containing MOF was more sensitive than recently reported detectors when irradiated with 20 keV X-rays, equivalent to the energy released during medical diagnostic imaging. Then, to make a flexible X-ray radiation detector, the team sandwiched the nickel-containing MOF between gold film electrodes, one of which was on a flexible plastic surface. They used copper wires to transmit current from each pixel of a 12x12 array and covered the whole device with a silicone-based flexible polymer. Finally, they placed an aluminum letter  H  on the detector and irradiated it with X-rays, measuring a much lower current output underneath the H than under the unimpeded material. The researchers say that their proof-of-concept device is promising for the next generation of radiology imaging equipment and radiation detection when wearable or flexible devices are needed.ReferenceLi Z, Chang S, Zhang H, et al.

The concept of such dyes is not new, but most previous mechanophores were able to only indicate the presence or absence of stress in plastics. The current research now enables to differentiate between stresses of different magnitude. This adds up great advantages whenever it is important to map stress distributions in macroscopic plastic components to monitor integrity of the material at all times. The research team is now one step further to developing this effective form of deformation and damage analysis, bringing it closer to practical applications.The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Communications on July 9, 2021.","Published: August 5, 2021"

The adult vaccine programme has progressed very successfully and more safety data has become available, so it was important to review the advice for the vaccination of children and young people.This updated advice means we can be confident that young people will be afforded around 80% protection against hospitalisation, following receipt of their first dose.It is expected that protection will probably be even higher as younger people respond better to vaccines and some will have already had the COVID-19 infection, meaning this first dose should act as a  booster  to their immunity.The JCVI has looked at the very latest safety data from the UK and other countries as we know that some serious side effects have been reported in this younger age group. This includes myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart). These are extremely rare and usually occur within a few days of the second dose, typically more in young men.Data from the USA suggests that, in males aged 12 to 17 years, 9.8 cases of myocarditis were reported per million first doses given. This rises to 67 per million after the second dose. Most people recovered quickly.We know that COVID-19 is usually mild in younger people and so it is important to weigh up the benefits of any vaccine against the possible, although extremely rare, side effects.In the current UK situation, where there is good uptake of the vaccine amongst adults, we can take a more precautionary approach to vaccine rollout in younger people, who are at lower risk of serious harm from COVID-19. Prioritising the first dose and delaying the recommendation on the second, allows the JCVI to provide the best available advice with the latest available information for the second dose, whilst providing some immediate protection from severe disease.The second dose can be given later and will extend protection for a longer period, for example when those young people start work or go to university, or if we begin to get another wave of cases in winter. It is important to keep young people well and in school in the autumn term and to minimise disruption to education as far as possible. For now we recommend prioritising the first dose in younger age groups.It is likely that, when the second dose is offered, this will be from 12 weeks after the first dose. The benefit of having an 8 to 12 week gap between the first and second doses is becoming increasingly clear, as it offers more protection for a longer period of time.Professor Wei Shen Lim, COVID-19 Chair for JCVI, said: After carefully considering the latest data, we advise that healthy 16 to 17 year olds are offered a first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Advice on when to offer the second vaccine dose will come later. While COVID-19 is typically mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some and for this particular age group, we expect one dose of the vaccine to provide good protection against severe illness and hospitalisation. As previously advised by the JCVI, children aged 12 to 15 with specific underlying health conditions that put them at risk of severe COVID-19 should be offered 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination with an interval of 8 weeks between doses.This includes children with severe neurodisabilities, Down s Syndrome, immunosuppression, profound and multiple learning disabilities, and severe learning disabilities or who are on the learning disability register. Children with additional underlying health conditions to be offered vaccination will be updated in the Green Book.Children and young people aged 12 years and over who are household contacts of an immunosuppressed person should also be offered 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Instead of running the algorithm on advanced quantum processors, the new approach uses a classical machine-learning algorithm that closely mimics the behavior of near-term quantum computers.In a paper published in Nature Quantum Information, EPFL professor Giuseppe Carleo and Matija Medvidovi , a graduate student at Columbia University and at the Flatiron Institute in New York, have found a way to execute a complex quantum computing algorithm on traditional computers instead of quantum ones.The specific  quantum software  they are considering is known as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and is used to solve classical optimization problems in mathematics; it s essentially a way of picking the best solution to a problem out of a set of possible solutions.  There is a lot of interest in understanding what problems can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer, and QAOA is one of the more prominent candidates,  says Carleo.Ultimately, QAOA is meant to help us on the way to the famed  quantum speedup , the predicted boost in processing speed that we can achieve with quantum computers instead of conventional ones. Understandably, QAOA has a number of proponents, including Google, who have their sights set on quantum technologies and computing in the near future: in 2019 they created Sycamore, a 53-qubit quantum processor, and used it to run a task it estimated it would take a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer around 10,000 years to complete. Sycamore ran the same task in 200 seconds. But the barrier of  quantum speedup  is all but rigid and it is being continuously reshaped by new research, also thanks to the progress in the development of more efficient classical algorithms,  says Carleo. In their study, Carleo and Medvidovi  address a key open question in the field: can algorithms running on current and near-term quantum computers offer a significant advantage over classical algorithms for tasks of practical interest?  If we are to answer that question, we first need to understand the limits of classical computing in simulating quantum systems,  says Carleo. This is especially important since the current generation of quantum processors operate in a regime where they make errors when running quantum  software , and can therefore only run algorithms of limited complexity.Using conventional computers, the two researchers developed a method that can approximately simulate the behavior of a special class of algorithms known as variational quantum algorithms, which are ways of working out the lowest energy state, or  ground state  of a quantum system. QAOA is one important example of such family of quantum algorithms, that researchers believe are among the most promising candidates for  quantum advantage  in near-term quantum computers.The approach is based on the idea that modern machine-learning tools, e.g. the ones used in learning complex games like Go, can also be used to learn and emulate the inner workings of a quantum computer. The key tool for these simulations are Neural Network Quantum States, an artificial neural network that Carleo developed in 2016 with Matthias Troyer, and that was now used for the first time to simulate QAOA. The results are considered the province of quantum computing, and set a new benchmark for the future development of quantum hardware. Our work shows that the QAOA you can run on current and near-term quantum computers can be simulated, with good accuracy, on a classical computer too,  says Carleo.  However, this does not mean that alluseful quantum algorithms that can be run on near-term quantum processors can be emulated classically. In fact, we hope that our approach will serve as a guide to devise new quantum algorithms that are both useful and hard to simulate for classical computers. Reference: Medvidovi  M, Carleo G.

The findings offer new insights into how the brain functions. Researchers have sought to identify neural circuits that have specialized functions, but there are simply too many tasks the brain performs for each circuit to have its own purpose,  explains Andr  Fenton, a professor of neural science at New York University and the senior author of the study, which appears in the journal Cell Reports.  Our results reveal how the same circuit takes on more than one function. The brain diverts  trains  of neural activity from encoding our experiences to recalling them, showing that the same circuits have a role in both information processing and in memory. This newly discovered dynamic shows how the brain functions more efficiently than previously realized. When the same circuit performs more than one function, synergistic, creative, and economic interactions become possible,  Fenton adds. To explore the role of brain circuits, the researchers examined the hippocampus a brain structure long known to play a significant role in memory in mice. They investigated how the mouse hippocampus switches from encoding the current location to recollecting a remote location. Here, mice navigated a surface and received a mild shock if they touched certain areas, prompting the encoding of information. When the mice subsequently returned to this surface, they avoided the area where they d previously received the shock--evidence that memory influenced their movement. The analysis of neural activity revealed a switching in the hippocampus. Specifically, the scientists found that a certain type of activity pattern in the population of neurons known as a dentate spike, which originates from the medial entorhinal cortex (DSM), served to coordinate changes in brain function. Railway switches control each train s destination, whereas dentate spikes switch hippocampus information processing from encoding to recollection,  observes Fenton.  Like a railway switch diverts a train, this dentate spike event diverts thoughts from the present to the past. Reference: Dvorak D, Chung A, Park EH, Fenton AA.

When implanted in rats with bone defects, the cylindrical scaffold promoted the regeneration of bone that was denser, more voluminous and more like the surrounding tissue than that achieved by many other state-of-the-art designs.The implant spurred regeneration even without the aid of externally sourced stem cells or so-called growth factors, which help promote healing but can also introduce regulatory complications and side effects that range from inflammation to unchecked tissue formation.""So far, we haven t found any scaffolds that can perform better than ours,"" said Jingwei Xie, PhD, professor of surgery at UNMC and courtesy professor of mechanical and materials engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. ""The structure is the key.""That signature structure stems from a recent engineering breakthrough, spearheaded by Dr. Xie, that has transformed a promising but limited two-dimensional approach into a 3D wonder.Prior to it, Dr. Xie said, many labs were developing 2D implants made from nanofibers that were aligned to form pores. Ideally, the thinking went, bone marrow stem cells would infiltrate those pores and eventually form tissues with an architecture similar to the native, adjacent bone. But engineers were often struggling to craft pores large or organized enough for cells to consistently pass through and subsequently form the tendrils of tissue that make up bone.So, inspired by a high school math concept, Dr. Xie set out to fabricate 3D scaffolds with larger, less haphazard, more navigable pores. The concept, called the solid of revolution, shows how any 2D curve   a rectangle, a triangle, a circle   can be rotated around an axis to form a mathematical solid. Rotating a rectangle forms a cylinder, for instance, whereas a triangle creates a cone and a circle makes a sphere.Dr. Xie s team applied the principle by taking a rectangular, millimeter-scale mat of stacked nanofibers, using heat to fix one end together like the spine of a book, then submerging the mat in a solution that expanded those fibers. Eventually, the loose end fanned around to form a cylinder whose nanofibers, and associated pores, radiated out from the center like the spokes of a wheel.The researchers suspected that the radial layout would encourage various types of cells from all around the injury site to migrate toward its center, forming networks of tissue in the process. To test it, they embedded the radial scaffolds into divots of missing bone in the upper skulls of rats, assessing the regrowth after four and eight weeks.At both time points, the radial scaffolds had regenerated bone that covered substantially more of the injury sites than in a control group and a group implanted with collagen sponges, a commonly used implant.""We found that the radially aligned nanofibers can really enhance the bone regeneration in this scenario, especially with the cranial bone,"" Dr. Xie said. ""The first four weeks, especially, we saw a significant difference. It can begin promoting bone regeneration within a very short timeframe.""The regenerated bone featured more minerals, such as calcium, essential to healthy bone formation. It was markedly denser and thicker, meaning it could help address the symptoms of osteoporosis. It grew in a radial alignment very similar to the scaffold s, suggesting that the cells were, in fact, following the pores. And when European colleagues ran simulations of mechanical stress based on the resulting growth, the regenerated bone s profile paralleled that of healthy cranial bone, hinting that the former might withstand compressive forces about as well as the latter.On top of all that, bone marrow cells that were cultured on the team s scaffold boasted naturally higher levels of multiple growth factors, including bone morphogenetic protein 2, or BMP-2   a form of which has been used in combination with collagen sponges to stimulate bone growth. Other emerging regenerative approaches   3D-printed scaffolds, aerogels, injectable hydrogels   often incorporate externally sourced BMP-2, too. Even so, those put to the test in rats have failed to stimulate growth as well as the Nebraska team s design, Dr. Xie said.The promise of a biodegradable implant that can stimulate such growth on its own, sans any external biological agents, could smooth its path toward eventually earning approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he said. Also working in its favor: The team fabricated the implant from a polyester already widely used in biomedical devices approved by the FDA.If it does eventually translate to a clinical setting, the implant could prove an appealing alternative to more traditional approaches, Dr. Xie said. Those include allografts, which consist of implanting bone fragments from donors, and autografts, which entail harvesting a segment of bone from one s own body and transplanting it to the injury site. The latter requires multiple surgeries and, among other issues, can reduce the functionality of whatever bone is harvested.Reference: Chen S, Wang H, Mainardi VL, et al.

A significant portion of these collections are available to the general public through digital imagery, but experts say there is an extraordinary amount of material that has never been read   a treasure trove of insight into the world s history hidden within.Now, researchers at University of Notre Dame are developing an artificial neural network to read complex ancient handwriting based on human perception to improve capabilities of deep learning transcription. We re dealing with historical documents written in styles that have long fallen out of fashion, going back many centuries, and in languages like Latin, which are rarely ever used anymore,  said Walter Scheirer, the Dennis O. Doughty Collegiate Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Notre Dame.  You can get beautiful photos of these materials, but what we ve set out to do is automate transcription in a way that mimics the perception of the page through the eyes of the expert reader and provides a quick, searchable reading of the text. In research published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers journal Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Scheirer outlines how his team combined traditional methods of machine learning with visual psychophysics   a method of measuring the connections between physical stimuli and mental phenomena, such as the amount of time it takes for an expert reader to recognize a specific character, gauge the quality of the handwriting or identify the use of certain abbreviations.Scheirer s team studied digitized Latin manuscripts that were written by scribes in the Cloister of St. Gall in the ninth century. Readers entered their manual transcriptions into a specially designed software interface. The team then measured reaction times during transcription for an understanding of which words, characters and passages were easy or difficult. Scheirer explained that including that kind of data created a network more consistent with human behavior, reduced errors and provided a more accurate, more realistic reading of the text. It s a strategy not typically used in machine learning,  Scheirer said.  We re labeling the data through these psychophysical measurements, which comes directly from psychological studies of perception   by taking behavioral measurements. We then inform the network of common difficulties in the perception of these characters and can make corrections based on those measurements. Using deep learning to transcribe ancient texts is something of great interest to scholars in the humanities. There s a difference between just taking the photos and reading them, and having a program to provide a searchable reading,  said Hildegund M ller, associate professor in the Department of Classics at Notre Dame.  If you consider the texts used in this study   ninth-century manuscripts   that s an early stage of the Middle Ages. It s a long time before the printing press. That s a time when an enormous amount of manuscripts were produced. There is all sorts of information hidden in these manuscripts   unidentified texts that nobody has seen before. Scheirer said challenges remain. His team is working on improving accuracy of transcriptions, especially in the case of damaged or incomplete documents, as well as how to account for illustrations or other aspects of a page that could be confusing to the network.However, the team was able to adjust the program to transcribe Ethiopian texts, adapting it to a language with a completely different set of characters   a first step toward developing a program with the capability to transcribe and translate information for users. In the literary field, it could be really helpful. Every good literary work is surrounded by a vast amount of historical documents, but where it s really going to be useful is in historical archival research,  said M ller.  There is a great need to advance the digital humanities. When you talk about the Middle Ages and early modern times, if you want to understand the details and consequences of historical events, you have to look through the written material, and these texts are the only thing we have. The problem may be even greater outside the Western world. Think of languages that are disappearing in cultures that are under threat. We must first of all preserve these works, make them accessible and, at some point, incorporate translations to make them a part of cultural processes that are still underway   and we are racing against time.

Take a tiny insect brain, which has less than a million neurons but shows a diversity of behaviors and is more energy efficient than current AI systems. These tiny brains serve as models for computing systems that are becoming more sophisticated as billions of silicon neurons can be implemented on hardware.The secret to achieving energy efficiency lies in the silicon neurons  ability to learn to communicate and form networks, as shown by new research from the lab of Shantanu Chakrabartty, the Clifford W. Murphy Professor in the Preston M. Green Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis  McKelvey School of Engineering.Their results were published July 28, 2021 in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience.For several years, his research group studied dynamical systems approaches to address the neuron-to-network performance gap and provide a blueprint for AI systems as energy efficient as biological ones.Previous work from his group showed that in a computational system, spiking neurons create perturbations which allow each neuron to  know  which others are spiking and which are responding. It s as if the neurons were all embedded in a rubber sheet formed by energy constraints; a single ripple, caused by a spike, would create a wave that affects them all. Like all physical processes, systems of silicon neurons tend to self-optimize to their least-energetic states, while also being affected by the other neurons in the network. These constraints come together to form a kind of secondary communication network, where additional information can be communicated through the dynamic but synchronized topology of spikes. It s as if the rubber sheet vibrates in a synchronized rhythm in response to multiple spikes.In the latest research, Chakrabartty and doctoral student Ahana Gangopadhyay showed how the neurons learn to pick the most energy-efficient perturbations and wave patterns in the rubber sheet. They show that if the learning is guided by sparsity (less energy), it s like the electrical stiffness of the rubber sheet is adjusted by each neuron so that the entire network vibrates in a most energy-efficient way. The neuron does this using only local information which is communicated more efficiently. Communications between the neurons then become an emergent phenomenon guided by the need to optimize energy use.This result could have significant implications on how neuromorphic AI systems might be designed.  We want to learn from neurobiology,  Chakrabartty said.  But we want to be able to exploit the best principles from both neurobiology and silicon engineering. Historically, neuromorphic engineering   modeling AI systems on biology   has been based on a relatively straightforward model of the brain. Take some neurons, a few synapses, connect everything together and, voila, it s  if not alive, at least able to perform a simple task (recognizing images, for example) as efficiently, or moreso, than a biological brain. These systems are built by connecting memory (synapses) and processors (neurons). Each performing its single task, as it was presumed to work in the brain. But this one-structure-to-one-function approach, though easy to understand and model, misses the full complexity and flexibility of the brain.Recent brain research has shown tasks are not so neatly divided, and there may be instances in which the same function is being performed by different brain structures, or multiple structures working together.  There is more and more information showing that this reductionist approach we ve followed might not be complete,  Chakrabartty said.The key to building an efficient system that can learn new things is the use of energy and structural constraints as a medium for computing and communications or, as Chakrabartty said,  Optimization using sparsity. The situation is reminiscent of the theory of six-degrees of Kevin Bacon: The challenge   or constraint   is to make connections to the actor by connecting six or fewer people.For a neuron that is physically located on one chip to be its most efficient, the challenge   or constraint   is completing its task within the allotted amount of energy. It might be more efficient for one neuron to communicate through intermediaries to get to the destination neuron. The challenge is how to pick the right set of  friend  neurons among many choices that might be available. Enter energy constraints and sparsity. Like a tired professor, a system in which energy has been constrained also will seek the least resistant way to complete an assigned task. Unlike the professor, an AI system can test all of its options at once, thanks to the superposition techniques developed in Chakrabartty s lab, which uses analog computing methods. In essence, a silicon neuron can attempt all communication routes at once, finding the most efficient way to connect in order to complete the assigned task.The current paper shows that a network of 1,000 silicon neurons can accurately detect odors with very few training examples. The long-term goal is to look for analogs in the brain of a locust which has also been shown to be adept in classifying odors. Chakrabartty has been collaborating with Barani Raman, a professor in Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Srikanth Singamaneni, The Lilyan & E. Lisle Hughes Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, to create a sort of cyborg locust   one with two brains, a silicon one connected to the biological one. This would be the most interesting and satisfactory aspect of this research if and when we can start connecting the two realms,  Chakrabartty said.  Not just physically, but also functionally.

The strategy applied a machine learning algorithm called SPLS-DA to analyze specific regions of the human genome called CoRSIVs, hoping to reveal epigenetic markers for the condition.  In DNA from blood samples, the team identified epigenetic markers, a profile of methyl chemical groups in the DNA, that differ between people diagnosed with schizophrenia and people without the disease and developed a model that would assess an individual s probability of having the condition. Testing the model on an independent dataset revealed that it can identify schizophrenia patients with 80% accuracy. The study appears in the journal Translational Psychiatry. Schizophrenia is a devastating disease that affects about 1% of the world s population,  said corresponding author Dr. Robert A. Waterland professor of pediatrics  nutrition at the USDA/ARS Children s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor and of molecular and human genetics.  Although genetic and environmental components seem to be involved in the condition, current evidence only explains a small portion of cases, suggesting that other factors, such as epigenetic, also could be important. Epigenetics is a system for molecular marking of DNA   it tells the different cells in the body which genes to turn on or off in that cell type, therefore epigenetic markers can vary between different normal tissues within one individual. This makes it challenging to assess whether epigenetic changes contribute to diseases involving the brain, like schizophrenia.To address this obstacle, Waterland and his colleagues had identified in previous work a set of specific genomic regions in which DNA methylation, a common epigenetic marker, differs between people but is consistent across different tissues in one person. They called these genomic regions CoRSIVs for correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation. They proposed that studying CoRSIVs is a novel way to uncover epigenetic causes of disease. Because methylation patterns in CoRSIVs are the same in all the tissues of one individual, we can analyze them in a blood sample to infer epigenetic regulation on other parts of the body that are difficult to assess, such as the brain,  Waterland said.Many previous studies have analyzed methylation profiles in blood samples with the goal of identifying epigenetic differences between individuals with schizophrenia, the researchers explained. Our study is innovative in various ways,  said first author Dr. Chathura J. Gunasekara, computer scientist in the Waterland lab.  We focused on CoRSIVs and also applied for the first time the SPLS-DA machine learning algorithm to analyze DNA methylation. As a scientist interested in applying machine learning to medicine, our findings are very exciting. They not only suggest the possibility of predicting risk of schizophrenia early in life, but also outline a new approach that may be applicable to other diseases. The current study also is innovative because it considered major potential confounding factors other studies did not take into account. For instance, methylation patterns in blood can be affected by factors such as smoking and taking antipsychotic medications, both of which are common in schizophrenia patients. Here, we took various approaches to evaluate whether the methylation patterns we detected at CoRSIVs were affected by medication use and smoking. We were able to rule that out,  Waterland said.  This, together with the fact that DNA methylation at CoRSIVs is established very early in life, indicates that the epigenetic differences we identified between schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals were there before the disease was diagnosed, suggesting they may contribute to the condition. Using this novel approach, the researchers were able to achieve much stronger epigenetic signals associated with schizophrenia than has ever been done before, said the team. We consider our study a proof of principle that focusing on CoRSIVs makes epigenetic epidemiology possible,  Waterland said.Reference: Gunasekara CJ, Hannon E, MacKay H, et al.

Scientists have long suspected that these barometers, or  baroreceptors,  existed in specialized kidney cells called renin cells, but no one has been able to locate the baroreceptors until now.The new findings, from UVA Health s Dr. Maria Luisa S. Sequeira-Lopez and colleagues, finally reveal where the barometers are located, how they work and how they help prevent high blood pressure (hypertension) or low blood pressure (hypotension). The researchers hope the insights will lead to new treatments for high blood pressure. It was exhilarating to find that the elusive pressure-sensing mechanism, the baroreceptor, was intrinsic to the renin cell, which has the ability to sense and react, both within the same cell,  said Sequeira-Lopez, of UVA s Department of Pediatrics and UVA s Child Health Research Center.  So the renin cells are sensors and responders. Sensing blood pressureThe existence of a pressure sensor inside renin cells was first proposed back in 1957. It made sense: The cells had to know when to release renin, a hormone that helps regulate blood pressure. But even though scientists suspected this cellular barometer had to exist, they couldn t tell what it was and whether it was located in renin cells or surrounding cells. Sequeira-Lopez and her team took new approaches to solving this decades-old mystery. Using a combination of innovative lab models, they determined that the baroreceptor was a  mechanotransducer  inside renin cells. This mechanotransducer detects pressure changes outside the cell, then transmits these mechanical signals to the cell nucleus, like how the cochlea in our ear turns sound vibrations into nerve impulses our brain can understand.The researchers have unlocked exactly how the baroreceptors work. They found that applying pressure to renin cells in lab dishes triggered changes within the cells and decreased activity of the renin gene, Ren1. The scientists also compared differences in gene activity in kidneys exposed to lower pressure and those exposed to higher pressure.Ultimately, when the baroreceptors detect too much pressure outside the renin cell, production of renin is restricted, while blood pressure that is too low prompts the production of more renin. This marvelous mechanism is vital to the body s ability to maintain the correct blood pressure. And now, after more than 60 years, we finally understand how and why. I feel really excited about this discovery, a real tour de force several years in the making. We had a great collaboration with Dr. [Douglas] DeSimone from the Department of Cell Biology,  Sequeira-Lopez said.  I am also excited with the work to come, to unravel the signaling and controlling mechanisms of this mechanotransducer and how we can use the information to develop therapies for hypertension.

The body needs sugar, or glucose, to survive, but, as the saying goes:  All good things in moderation,  said Ning Wu, Ph.D., an assistant professor at Van Andel Institute and corresponding author of the study.  We found that too much glucose in cells, which is directly linked to the amount of sugar consumed in one s diet, affects lipid composition throughout the body, which in turn affects the integrity of mitochondria. The overall effect is a loss of optimal function. Using their new model, Wu and her colleagues demonstrated that excess glucose reduces the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the mitochondrial membrane and makes mitochondria less efficient. PUFAs are vital players in supporting mitochondrial function and mediating a host of other biological processes such as inflammation, blood pressure and cellular communication.Instead, excess glucose is synthesized into a different form of fatty acid that isn t as efficient or as flexible as PUFAs. This upends the lipid composition of the membrane and puts stress on the mitochondria, damaging them and impacting their performance.Wu and her colleagues were able to reverse this detrimental effect by feeding their mouse models a low-sugar ketogenic diet, which suggests that reducing glucose and restoring normal membrane lipid composition supports healthy mitochondrial integrity and function. They also found that consuming excess carbohydrates reduces the beneficial effect of PUFA supplements. Although we may not always notice the difference in mitochondrial performance right away, our bodies do,  Wu explained.  If the lipid balance is thrown off for long enough, we may begin to feel subtle changes, such as tiring more quickly. While our study does not offer medical recommendations, it does illuminate the early stages of metabolic disease and provides insights that may shape future prevention and therapeutic efforts.

Since we cannot typically see our own faces and tongues while we speak, however, the potential role of visual feedback has remained less clear.In the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, University of Montreal and McGill University researchers present a study exploring how readily speakers will integrate visual information about their tongue movements   captured in real time via ultrasound   during a speech motor learning task. Participants in our study, all typical speakers of Quebec French, wore a custom-molded prosthesis in their mouths to change the shape of their hard palate, just behind their upper teeth, to disrupt their ability to pronounce the sound  s    in effect causing a temporary speech disorder related to this sound,  said Douglas Shiller, an associate professor at the University of Montreal.One group received visual feedback of their tongue with a sensor under their chin oriented to provide an ultrasound image within the sagittal plane (a slice down the midline, front to back).A second group also received visual feedback of their tongue. In this case, the sensor was oriented at 90 degrees to the previous condition with an image of the tongue within the coronal plane (across the tongue from left to right).A third group, the control group, received no visual feedback of their tongue.All participants were given the opportunity to practice the  s  sound with the prosthesis in place for 20 minutes. We compared the acoustic properties of the  s  across the three groups to determine to what degree visual feedback enhanced the ability to adapt tongue movements to the perturbing effects of the prosthesis,  said Shiller.As expected, participants in the coronal visual feedback group improved their  s  production to a greater degree than those receiving no visual feedback. We were surprised, however, to find participants in the sagittal visual feedback group performed even worse than the control group that received no visual feedback,  said Shiller.  In other words, visual feedback of the tongue was found to either enhance motor learning or interfere with it, depending on the nature of the images being presented. The group s findings broadly support the idea that ultrasound tools can improve speech learning outcomes when used, for example, in the treatment of speech disorders or learning new sounds in a second language. But care must be taken in precisely how visual information is selected and presented to a patient,  said Shiller.  Visual feedback that isn t compatible with the demands of the speaking task may interfere with the person s natural mechanisms of speech learning   potentially leading to worse outcomes than no visual feedback at all.

In response to a foreign invader in the body, various subsets of T cells are responsible for several functions that include killing infected cells and secreting signaling molecules called cytokines that tell other immune cells where to go and what to do. Different types of T cells and other immune cells are often characterized by the presence of certain proteins on the cell surface. However, how these proteins affect cell functions and interactions during an immune response is not clear.In a new study published in Journal of Investigative Dermatology, a team led by researchers at the University of Tsukuba have examined the roles of a receptor called programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), as well as two cell surface molecules that can bind to this receptor, programmed cell death ligand-1/2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2). These proteins form a system known as immune checkpoints. PD-1 is expressed by activated T cells, while PD-L1 and PD-L2 can be expressed by a wide variety of cell types. Immune checkpoints are part of tolerance, which is how the immune system knows to not attack its own cells. The interactions between PD-1 and its ligands can block T cells from proliferating and producing cytokines. The importance of this was previously demonstrated when lab mice lacking the PD-1 gene developed autoimmune diseases. However, less is known about the roles and expression patterns of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Because of this, the research group aimed to investigate these ligands in various T cell subsets. ""We know that ligand binding of the PD-1 receptor is extremely significant, and it has been a target of different immunotherapies for cancer treatment. Many cancer cells express these checkpoint molecules and so are able to evade the immune system,"" explains Professor Naoko Okiyama, senior author of the study. ""Yet, we do not fully understand the differences between the PD-L1 and PD-L2 functions in immune responses."" The team stimulated two immune cell types with three individual cytokines, finding that PD-L1 was induced in these cells by both interferon-gamma (IFN- ) and interleukin (IL)-17A, while PD-L2 was induced by IL-4. On the basis of these results, the researchers then examined mouse models of various inflammatory skin conditions, focusing on the three T cell subsets that have responses mediated by IFN- , IL-17A, and IL-4, respectively. IFN- -mediated Th1 responses include immune reactions to virus infections and almost all autoimmune diseases, and IL-17A-mediated Th17 cells respond to fungal infections and some inflammatory disorders like psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. However, IL-4-mediated Th2 responses are represented by immune reactions in vermination and allergic disorders like atopic dermatitis. ""The mice we tested were either wild-type (normal), PD-L1-deficient, or PD-L2-deficient,"" says Professor Okiyama. ""Increased ear thickness from swelling was indicative of dermatitis-like skin inflammation in this model system."" Interestingly, the group observed that ear thickness was more pronounced in the PD-L1-deficient mice in both the Th1 and Th17 models compared with the wild-type and PD-L2-deficient animals. The reverse was true for the Th2 model, with the PD-L2-deficient mice having more extensive ear thickness. These results suggest that PD-L1 plays a more predominant role in IFN-  and IL-17A-mediated T cell responses, while PD-L2 is more central to IL-4-based T cell responses. These fascinating data provide a greater understanding of immune checkpoints and will aid in the further development of cancer immunotherapies.ReferenceTanaka R, Ichimura Y, Kubota N, et al.

The gel also offers hope for patients who have suffered from other neurological conditions such as strokes. The new material is made from natural amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - and acts as a gateway to facilitate the safe transfer of stem cells into the brain and restore damaged tissue by releasing a growth-enabling protein called GDNF. By putting the stem cells into a gel, they are exposed to less stress when injected into the brain and are more gently and successfully integrated.  ""When we shake or apply energy to the hydrogel, the substance turns into a liquid which allows us to inject it into the brain through a very small capillary using a needle,"" Professor David Nisbet, from the ANU John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR), said. ""Once inside the brain, the gel returns to its solid form and provides support for the stem cells to replace lost dopamine neurons."" Professor Clare Parish, Head of the Stem Cell and Neural Development Laboratory at The Florey Institute, said: ""Through use of the hydrogel technique we demonstrated increased survival of the grafted dopamine neurons and restored movement in an animal model of Parkinson's disease."" Although dopamine-related drugs are a readily used treatment for people living with Parkinson's disease, many have undesirable side effects that are exacerbated with time. ""The stem cell transplant delivered in this hydrogel on the other hand avoids many of these side effects and could provide a one-off intervention that can sustain dopamine levels for decades to come,"" Professor Parish said. Professor Nisbet said the hydrogel has the potential to also treat patients who have suffered a stroke and could even be used to treat damaged knees or shoulders, following successful animal trials. ""When we introduced the gel technology with the stem cells we saw huge improvement in the animals' coordinated paw movement and overall motor function recovery,"" he said. The hydrogel technology is cost-effective and easy to manufacture on a mass scale, and it's hoped the treatment could soon be made available in hospitals, but it must first undergo clinical trials. ""We must do our due diligence and ensure we check all the right boxes regarding safety, efficacy and regulatory approval before we can take this technology into the clinic, but we hope it can be available for use in the not-too-distant future,"" Professor Parish said.Reference: Hunt CPJ, Penna V, Gantner CW, et al.

Over 65 percent of these plants use evaporative cooling, leading to huge white plumes that billow from their cooling towers, which can be a nuisance and, in some cases, even contribute to dangerous driving conditions.Now, a small company based on technology recently developed at MIT by the Varanasi Research Group is hoping to reduce both the water needs at these plants and the resultant plumes   and to potentially help alleviate water shortages in areas where power plants put pressure on local water systems.The technology is surprisingly simple in principle, but developing it to the point where it can now be tested at full scale on industrial plants was a more complex proposition. That required the real-world experience that the company s founders gained from installing prototype systems, first on MIT s natural-gas-powered cogeneration plant and then on MIT s nuclear research reactor.In these demanding tests, which involved exposure to not only the heat and vibrations of a working industrial plant but also the rigors of New England winters, the system proved its effectiveness at both eliminating the vapor plume and recapturing water. And, it purified the water in the process, so that it was 100 times cleaner than the incoming cooling water.

At present, however, as highlighted by a research team from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) together with researchers from Nigeria, the plants still contain highly toxic substances that are carcinogenic and liver-damaging. The researchers are now aiming to generate toxin-free varieties so that the plant can be safely used.Our planet is home to a rich treasury of plant species. Some 300,000 edible plants are available to feed the world s population, although only a fraction of them is consumed. The three major crops rice, wheat and maize feed half of the world s population. These cereals have high yields and are staple crops. They are rich in carbohydrates, and thus are efficient calorie sources. In some countries however, they are often the only food source for the poor, and because certain grain crops such as rice contain very few vitamins and minerals, malnutrition and resulting diseases are the outcome.Using additional plant species is important for preventing unbalanced diets and for increasing agricultural biodiversity. In this respect, fruit and vegetable are of crucial importance.  Although these orphan crops are often highly important locally and well-adapted to regional climates, they have been neglected in research and breeding activities, since they are minor in terms of global trade,  explains Brigitte Poppenberger, Professor of Biotechnology of Horticultural Crops at TUM. Therefore, to promote research with neglected crops from Africa, the  African Orphan Crops Consortium  was founded, a consortium of universities, industrial partners and non-governmental organizations that is sequencing the genomes of the 101 most important orphan crop species of Africa, to create essential resources for research and breeding. One of these orphan crops is the leafy vegetable and medicinal plant Ebolo. Ebolo (Crassocephalum crepidioides), which is used for example in soups, stews and salads, is still mainly collected from the wild.  In some areas, when the demand is high, over-harvesting occurs and threatens natural populations,  says Prof. Poppenberger. Therefore, it is important to establish cultivation techniques for plant production and to improve key characteristics through breeding, and for this purpose a research team at TUM has started to analyze the plant in detail.The team, headed by Prof. Poppenberger, in collaboration with Prof. Traud Winkelmann from the Leibniz University of Hannover, has demonstrated that Ebolo synthesizes a toxin called jacobine, which is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid. Jacobine is liver-damaging and carcinogenic, even in the smallest of quantities.  A number of our modern crops such as zucchini, tomatoes, peppers and potatoes can produce highly toxic substances as well, but still, they were domesticated. The removal or reduction of toxins through breeding is often an important step in improving crop species,  explains Prof. Poppenberger. The research team has succeeded in showing that the formation of jacobine is stimulated by nitrogen deficiency, and that it is absent in the related species Crassocephalum rubens.  That is, of course, an important finding. However, we should not rely solely on this related plant, as Crassocephalum crepdioides has other advantages, such as higher yields, even in very poor growth conditions,  says Prof. Poppenberger.The findings regarding the biochemistry and genetics of jacobine biosynthesis will now facilitate the development of cultivation techniques and the breeding of toxin-free varieties, to enable a safe consumption of the plants. Since pyrrolizidine alkaloids are formed by many species as part of the chemical defense system of plants, a more detailed knowledge of the formation of these toxins is also of interest for other plants. The scientists from Germany and Nigeria will continue to cooperate to promote research with neglected crops. In the case of Ebolo, for example, it will be necessary to test in the fields in Nigeria, if the removal of the toxin has a negative impact on insect resistance. After all, while improved nutritional traits for humans are desired, the plants should not also become  tastier  for harmful insects.ReferenceSchramm S, Rozhon W, Adedeji-Badmus AN, et al.

This ensures that each new cell has a unique genetic makeup and explains why, with the exception of identical twins, no two siblings are ever completely genetically alike.These exchanges of DNA, or crossovers, are essential for generating genetic diversity, the driving force for evolution, and their frequency and position along chromosomes are tightly controlled.Co-first author of the study Dr Chris Morgan explains the significance of this phenomenon:  Crossover positioning has important implications for evolution, fertility and selective breeding. By understanding the mechanisms that drive crossover positioning we are more likely to be able to uncover methods to modify crossover positioning to improve current plant and animal breeding technologies. Despite over a century of research, the cellular mechanism that determines where, and how many, crossovers form has remained mostly mysterious, a puzzle that has fascinated and frustrated many eminent scientists. The phrase  crossover interference  was coined in 1915 and describes the observation that when a crossover occurs at one location on a chromosome, it inhibits the formation of crossovers nearby.Using a cutting-edge combination of mathematical modelling and  3D-SIM super-resolution microscopy, a team of John Innes Centre researchers have solved this century old mystery by identifying a mechanism which ensures that crossover numbers and positions are  just right : not too many, not too few and not too close together.The team studied the behaviour of a protein called HEI10 which plays an integral role in crossover formation in meiosis. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that HEI10 proteins cluster along chromosomes, initially forming lots of small groups.However, as time passes, the HEI10 proteins concentrate in only a small number of much larger clusters which, once they reach a critical mass, can trigger crossover formation.These measurements were then compared against a mathematical model which simulates this clustering, based on diffusion of the HEI10 molecules and simple rules for their clustering. The mathematical model was capable of explaining and predicting many experimental observations, including that crossover frequency could be reliably modified by simply altering the amount HEI10.Co-first author Dr John Fozard explains:  Our study shows that data from super-resolution images of Arabidopsis reproductive cells is consistent with a mathematical  diffusion-mediated coarsening  model for crossover patterning in Arabidopsis. The model helps us understand the patterning of crossovers along meiotic chromosomes. The work builds on the John Innes Centre legacy of using plants as model organisms to study conserved and fundamental aspects of genetics. This same process was also studied by John Innes Centre alumni J.B.S Haldane and Cyril Darlington in the 1930s. The model also supports predictions that were made by another famous John Innes Centre alumnus, Robin Holliday, in the 1970s.Corresponding author, Professor Martin Howard, adds:  This work is a great example of interdisciplinary research, where cutting-edge experiments and mathematical modelling were both needed to unlock the heart of the mechanism. One exciting future avenue will be to assess whether our model can successfully explain crossover patterning in other diverse organisms. This research will be particularly valuable for cereal crops, such as wheat, in which crossovers are mostly restricted to specific regions of the chromosomes, preventing the full genetic potential of these plants from being available to plant breeders.Reference: Morgan C, Fozard JA, Hartley M, Henderson IR, Bomblies K, Howard M.

Now, a team of Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers have found that an anti-parasitic drug prevents pancreatic cancer s initiation, progression and metastasis in genetically engineered mice.In a study published in the journal Oncotarget on July 6, Gregory Riggins, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurosurgery and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and his team used two different mouse models to determine that the anti-parasitic drug mebendazole could slow or stop the growth and spread of both early and late-stage pancreatic cancer. We think that mebendazole could have a role in all stages,  Riggins says.  It was particularly effective for pancreatic cancer that was detected early. Riggins and his team administered mebendazole to mice that were genetically engineered to develop pancreatic cancer. The team measured the inflammation and the change in tissue, as well as the stage, grade and metastatic status in each tumor.Originally used to fight roundworm, hookworm and other parasitic infections by cutting off the parasites  supply of nutrition, mebendazole inhibits the formation of tubulin. Tubulin, Riggins explains, is both a micro-skeleton of the inner cell and a highway for transport. The drug gets into the parasite s gut and collapses the tubulin, starving the parasite to death. The study shows that mebendazole may act similarly in pancreatic cancer by collapsing cancer cells  structure, along with other mechanisms such as reducing inflammation.Riggins says he hopes to continue his team s research through human clinical trials. We are advocating for use of mebendazole as a therapy for those diagnosed before metastasis to see if we can slow or prevent pancreatic cancer,  Riggins says.  For those with more advanced cancers, it could be an alternative to certain surgeries. Mebendazole may have utility as a therapy after initial treatment to prevent tumor recurrence in the 15% to 20% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who undergo surgery. It may also increase the durability of response to standard chemotherapy in the remaining 80% to 85% of patients with advanced disease. Reference: Williamson T, Abreu MC de, Trembath DG, et al.

Michael King, chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Joshua D. Greenlee, graduate research fellow in biomedical engineering, are investigating whether a naturally occurring protein made in immune cells, called TRAIL, is effective in killing colon cancer cells.This knowledge may enable the development of new therapies that make aggressive cancer cells easier to kill off before they spread to other parts of the body.The researchers found that TRAIL is more effective in killing these drug resistant colon cancer cells.  We found that these cells had higher quantities of a protein called death receptor 4 on the cell surface,  Greenlee said.  This receptor does just what the name suggests, causes death of the cell upon binding to TRAIL. We also found that these death receptors were more likely to cluster together on the cell membrane in what are known as  lipid rafts.  When these receptors are found within these rafts, TRAIL is even more effective at killing cancer cells. Using this knowledge, King, Greenlee and their collaborators designed TRAIL-coated nanoparticles that effectively kill 57 percent of cancer cells in the blood of patients with advanced chemo-resistant colon cancer. In some patient blood samples, the TRAIL-coated nanoparticles destroyed all detectable cancer cells, King said. Higher levels of lipid raft death receptor 4 in these patients also coincided with increased treatment efficacy of TRAIL-coated nanoparticles. ","Published: August 4, 2021"

However, less is known about how the complex flow patterns and mechanical stresses produced in the stomach contribute to digestion.Researchers from France, Michigan, and Switzerland built a prototype of an artificial antrum, or lower stomach, to present a deeper understanding of how physical forces influence food digestion based on fluid dynamics. In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, they reveal a classifying effect based on the breakup of liquid drops combined with transport phenomena derived from complementary computer simulations. The relevant parts of the stomach are the corpus, where food is stored; the antrum, where food is ground; and the pylorus, or pyloric sphincter, the tissue valve that connects to the small intestine. Slow-wave muscle contractions begin in the corpus, with wave speed and amplitude increasing to form the antral contraction waves (ACWs) as they propagate toward the pylorus. The researchers  antrum device consists of a cylinder, capped at one end to imitate a closed pylorus, and a hollow piston that moves inside the cylinder to replicate ACWs. As verified through computer simulations and experimental measurements, the protype produces the characteristics of retropulsive jet flow that exist in the antrum. Food disintegration is quantified by determining the breakup of liquid drops in flow fields produced by ACWs. The researchers studied different model fluid systems with various viscosity to account for the broad physical properties of digested food. The drop size and other parameters resemble conditions in a real stomach. Drop breakup occurred near the surface of the hollow piston, where the flow field exhibited slower velocities but higher strain rates, thus exposing the drop to higher shear stresses during a longer period of time. No breakup occurred for drops near the center of the piston, because the stresses and residence times are smaller and shorter.  The results extracted from this simple prototype have deepened insights into the disintegration process that takes place in the stomach,  co-author Damien Dufour said.  Drops near the wall will break up as they are transported toward the pylorus. The drops in the center return toward the corpus, without major size reduction, to disintegrate later. One may perceive this combined action of the ACWs as a classifying effect. ReferenceDufour D, Tanner FX, Feigl KA, Windhab EJ.

But the process of developing new drugs is costly, can take decades, and often leads to failed treatments. The database, called NICEdrug.ch and described today in eLife, may help expedite the process by helping scientists find promising, existing drugs that might be repurposed for these diseases. By finding a way to improve how we discover and design new drugs, we could reduce the time and costs involved in the drug-development process,  says lead author Homa Mohammadi Peyhani, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Laboratory of Computational Systems Biotechnology,  cole Polytechnique F d rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.To help, Peyhani and colleagues created the NICEdrug.ch database with information on 250,000 potential drug molecules. The database includes detailed analysis of the drugs  structures, the enzymes they target, how they are likely to be altered by human metabolism, and their potential side effects.Using their database, the team showed that it could accurately predict the behaviour of drug-enzyme pairs around 70% of the time, and that it was 100% accurate for half of the pairs tested.They then used the system to look for drugs that could be repurposed for cancer, high cholesterol, malaria and COVID-19. Their search yielded some clues on how scientists might alleviate the toxic side effects of the cancer drug 5-fluorouracil. They also identified shikimate 3-phospate as a potential drug to treat the liver stage of malaria with fewer side effects. And they identified over 1,300 potential anti-COVID-19 drugs, including some that are already safely used to treat a number of other conditions. Further studies are now necessary to validate that these drugs can be repurposed for this disease.The researchers have made the NICEdrug.ch database available for others as an open-access resource. In addition to helping find new purposes for existing drugs, the system may help scientists understand why some drugs cause harmful side effects and either identify ways to alleviate them or explore alternative drugs. Our hope is that scientists and decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry alike can use this unique database to better inform their research and clinical decisions   saving time, money and ultimately lives,  concludes senior author Vassily Hatzimanikatis, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering at EPFL.Reference: MohammadiPeyhani H, Chiappino-Pepe A, Haddadi K, Hafner J, Hadadi N, Hatzimanikatis V.

It can lead to significant blood loss during pregnancy and delivery, requiring blood transfusions and intensive care, and it can result in serious illness and infection and can even be fatal for the mother. The condition occurs in less than 0.5% of pregnancies.Currently, placenta accreta spectrum disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound in combination with an assessment of a mother s pregnancy history. For example, a previous cesarean birth and a history of placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta that covers the birth canal, can indicate a heightened risk. But those factors alone are usually not reliable enough to detect cases other than the most severe ones.The new blood test can be performed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, which allows for early referrals to doctors who specialize in high-risk pregnancies. In tests with more than 100 women, the blood test was 79% accurate in confirming the presence of placenta accreta and 93% accurate in ruling it out with a negative result. Early and precise detection of this very high-risk obstetrical problem can greatly improve outcomes for both the mother and baby,  said Dr. Yalda Afshar, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and co-first author of the study.  With the unreliability of the current screening methods for placenta accreta, we saw a pressing need to create an easy-to-implement screening that can be conducted early in the pregnancy in all healthcare settings regardless of resources available to patients. A paper detailing the new method is published today in Nature Communications.The new approach uses a technology called the NanoVelcro Chip, which has been developed over the past 15 years by Dr. Yazhen Zhu and Hsian-Rong Tseng, UCLA professors of molecular and medical pharmacology. Originally created to detect tumor cells in people with cancer, the chip is a postage stamp sized device with nanowires that are 1,000 times thinner than a human hair and coated with antibodies that can recognize specific cells.For the new study, the researchers adapted the chip so that it could detect placenta cells in the mother s blood that are linked to placenta accreta spectrum disorder. Those cells, called trophoblasts, appear in the first few days of pregnancy. When a blood sample is tested using the chip, trophoblasts stick to the chip and can be detected under a microscope. An abnormally high count of trophoblasts or a trophoblast cluster in the blood indicates an elevated risk for placenta accreta disorder. Seeing a trophoblast cluster for the first time was like seeing glistening pearls,  said Zhu, one of the study s senior authors.  When we saw the cells on the microscope, it felt like we had a direct view into the placenta in the developing pregnancy. Dr. Margareta Pisarska, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Cedars-Sinai, said the research team s multidisciplinary approach was a key to the study s success. The efficacy of this test, and the strength of our work comes from bringing together experts from many disciplines, including obstetrics, nanotechnology, pathology, engineering, chemistry, microfluidics and biostatistics,  said Pisarska, a co-senior author of the study.  The diversity in our team allowed us to create an innovative solution to improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. The researchers are exploring ways to refine the test to improve its accuracy and reliability.Reference: Afshar Y, Dong J, Zhao P, et al.

A key element to slowing metastasis is understanding the mechanisms of how tumor cells invade tissues.In APL Bioengineering, by AIP Publishing, biophysics researchers at the University of Wisconsin explain how microscopic defects in how healthy cells line up can alter how easily ovarian cancer cells invade tissue. Using an experimental model, where the cellular makeup mimics the lining of the abdominal cavity, the group found that disruptions in the normal cellular layout, called topological defects, affect the rate of tumor cell invasion.""My lab is very interested in identifying ways to slow metastasis. This study is exciting, because it demonstrates a unique role for organization of nontumor cells to either aid or slow that process,"" said author Pamela Kreeger. ""Identifying factors that regulate this organization could help us to achieve our goal.""Topological defects are well known to the world of physics, ranging from quantum field theory to cosmological phenomena, but are only starting to find use in medicine and biology.The group's model consisted of a single layer of healthy cells, called mesothelial cells, the predominant cell type that covers structures inside the abdomen, where ovarian cancer often metastasizes.""A common way to fill space is a honeycomblike packing, in which each 'cell' would be nearly spherical,"" said author Jacob Notbohm. ""But in our case, the mesothelial cells were elongated, making the honeycomb packing not possible.""Such elongation led to areas of well-ordered cell layers and left other areas with alignment imperfections, causing the topological defects. These flaws in this alignment have been associated with a host of microscopic influences, including altered cell density, motion, and forces.They seeded ovarian cancer cells on top of the mesothelial cell layer and compared what effect the arrangement of the mesothelial cells had on how the tumor cells passed through this barrier.The patterns of cell flow were different near the defects, with certain defects causing inward cell flow, toward the center of the defect. At those locations of inward flow, the cancer cells passed through the mesothelial barrier more slowly.In addition to pursuing the impact of topographical organization in cancer cell metastasis, the group is looking to investigate the cause of topological defects, with the hopes of finding ways to direct cell patterning in uses, such as tissue engineering.Reference: Zhang J, Yang N, Kreeger PK, Notbohm J.

Preterm births are common,  said Hanne Hoffmann, an assistant professor in the Department of Animal Science in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.  If we know the mother is at risk for a preterm birth, her doctor can monitor her more closely. Hoffmann s research was published online in the Journal Biology of Reproduction. Hoffmann and her colleagues studied 157 healthy mothers with no history of preterm births, among them 51 who subsequently gave birth preterm. Researchers looked at second trimester data for evidence of biomarkers that could signal preterm delivery. How often do you find the needle in the haystack?  Hoffmann said.  We were excited to discover lower mRNA levels in the CRY2 and CLOCK genes. The CRY2 and CLOCK genes belong to a family of genes responsible for cell circadian rhythms. Hoffmann said that each human cell has its own 24-hour clock that keeps track of time inside the cell. Low levels of mRNA, or messenger DNA, in those two genes is associated with a higher risk of preterm birth, suggesting these genes provide information as to when labor should start.Decreased levels of mRNA in the mother's blood become present during the second trimester of pregnancy when most women have an important 20-week prenatal appointment to screen for Down syndrome. This presents the ideal time to also test for the risk of preterm delivery.The next step is to determine if the CRY2 and CLOCK genes are coming from the mother, placenta or fetus. The researchers also want to see how the mRNA levels in healthy women compare with levels in women with underlying conditions or a history of preterm births to determine if this blood test could be helpful for these at-risk mothers, too. If we could measure women s mRNA levels and tell them for their second or third pregnancies, that they aren t at risk for a preterm birth because their levels are higher (in a normal/healthy range), that would be such a comfort to the mothers who previously had a preterm birth,  Hoffmann said.The researchers are also interested in looking at other genes such as another circadian clock gene, called PER3, that in combination with CRY2 and CLOCK levels could indicate other pregnancy complications such a preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.  If I can help one baby make it to full term who wasn t supposed to, that would make my day,  said Hoffmann.Reference: Zhou G, Duong TV, Kasten EP, Hoffmann HM.

Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: On behalf of my colleagues across Oxford I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to AstraZeneca for the extraordinary accomplishment of releasing one billion doses of our life saving vaccine. By distributing this vaccine at cost, they have made an admirable and exemplary contribution to global health. We are delighted to be in partnership with them. Dame Sarah Gilbert, Sa d Professor of Vaccinology, and co-developer of the vaccine, said: We started to create this vaccine in January 2020 without knowing if it would ever be needed. To have reached one billion doses released only 18 months later is a phenomenal achievement on the part of AstraZeneca, who have co-ordinated manufacturing at multiple sites around the world to reach this milestone. It was made possible by many years of research at Oxford University in the production of the vaccine platform technology, developing a manufacturing process and conducting clinical trials with other ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines. Sir Andy Pollard, Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity, and Director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: There is huge satisfaction and pride for the vaccine researchers, and the members of the public who took part in the trials, to have brought a billion doses of a life-saving vaccine to the world. We also pay tribute to the superhuman efforts of the teams at AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India who are producing a phenomenal number of doses 24 hours a day and getting them to vaccine clinics in more than 170 countries. There is still so much to do, and all in the supply chain are pushing on knowing the next billion people are still waiting for their doses. Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute, said: This extraordinary manufacturing achievement, supplying over 170 countries with a billion doses of vaccine within seven months of licensure, reflects important improvements in manufacturing process yield made in Oxford, AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India last year, and our engagement from March 2020 onwards with some of the world s largest vaccine manufacturers.

They hope that this will enable doctors to react more precisely when treating the disease.Epilepsy affects some 50 million people worldwide and pharmaceutical treatment of the disease is a tightrope walk, as the dose must be tailored precisely to the individual patient:  Slightly too little and it isn t effective. Slightly too much and it becomes toxic,  explains Professor Pablo Sinues.Sinues is Botnar Research Professor of Pediatric Environmental Medicine at the University of Basel and University Children s Hospital Basel (UKBB). He is also a member of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Basel. Together with colleagues from University Hospital Zurich (UHZ), he spent two and a half years looking for a way to tailor the dosage of drugs administered to epilepsy patients as precisely as possible. They ultimately achieved this goal with the help of a breath test. The advantage is that monitoring does not require a blood sample, which can always be a stress factor for children. And as the sample doesn t need to be sent to the laboratory first, the results are available immediately.Searching for the tiniest concentrations You can think of it as being like the alcohol test that police use when they stop drivers,  Sinues explains. The difference is that this breath measurement device is actually a big machine.  Because alcohol is present at high concentrations in breath, one only need a small device. But we re searching for a droplet in 20 swimming pools,  he says. The researchers want to use the results to determine whether the active substances are present at the right concentrations in the body and whether they have the desired effect on the disease.Their efforts have not been in vain: both among the young patients at UKBB and the adult reference group at the University Hospital Zurich, the breath tests produced the same results as conventional blood tests, as reported by the research group in their study published in Communications Medicine. This means that in addition to blood tests, there is a second way of monitoring epilepsy treatment   and the method also provides further information on the patient's metabolism that doctors can use in the therapy.Interdisciplinary collaboration is a recipe for successThe special thing about this research project is the unique dovetailing of science and medical practice at the University of Basel, says Sinues:  Thanks to this favorable initial situation, we are able to build machines that are precisely tailored to the needs of doctors. At UKBB, the rapid availability of test results is a particular advantage of the new method: young patients require constant adjustments of their medication because their metabolism changes as they grow. The new technology provides doctors with a non-invasive test that gives them immediate clues as to how well the course of therapy is going. This enables them to respond quickly if the dose has to be adjusted.It took four years to reach this breakthrough and the technique is not yet suitable for widespread use   but that is the goal that Sinues has set himself. Indeed, the start-up  Deep Breath Intelligence  was founded specifically for that purpose and now aims to obtain a license for the measurement technique.Reference: Singh KD, Osswald M, Ziesenitz VC, et al.

Previously, technicians relied on gravity to perform separations in hot cells, since high radiation levels would destroy an HPIC s electronic components. Gaddis used radiation-tolerant materials to build a HPIC that uses air pressure, not electricity, to control the flow of the sample and chemicals that separate Ac-225 from byproducts. In tests, the HPIC cut separations time by 75%. That s important because demand is high for Ac-225, which has a short half-life.  Hours matter,  Gaddis said.

In digital cameras, the sensor consists of many millions of photosensitive cells distributed evenly over the sensor surface. These pixels all have the same size and are uniformly packed. In the human retina, on the other hand, there are two types of pixels: rod and cone photoreceptors. While rods help seeing in dim light, cones enable us to see color and fine details. In contrast to their technical counterparts, cones vary greatly in size and spacing. In the fovea, a specialized central area conveying sharpest vision, there are up to 200,000 cones per square millimeter; this number drops to about 5,000 in the periphery. This is comparable to a camera with varying resolution across the field of view, resulting in sharp and less sharp areas in the final image.Dr. Wolf Harmening, head of the adaptive optics and visual psychophysics group at the Department of Ophthalmology at the University Hospital Bonn explains: ""In humans, cone packing varies within the fovea itself, with a sharp peak in its center. When we focus on an object, we align our eyes so that its image falls exactly on that spot   that, at least, was the general assumption so far.""","Published: August 3, 2021"

These chemically-modified guide RNAs significantly enhance the ability to target   trace, edit, and/or knockdown   RNA in human cells.In a study published today in Cell Chemical Biology, the team explores a range of different RNA modifications and details how the modified guides increase efficiencies of CRISPR activity from 2- to 5-fold over unmodified guides. They also show that the optimized chemical modifications extend CRISPR targeting activity from 48 hours to four days. The researchers worked in collaboration with scientists at Synthego Corporation and New England BioLabs, bringing together a diverse team with expertise in enzyme purification and RNA chemistry. To apply these optimized chemical modifications, the research team targeted cell surface receptors in human T cells from healthy donors and a  universal  segment of the genetic sequence shared by all known variants of the RNA virus SARS-COV-2, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.Increasing the efficiencies and  life  of CRISPR-Cas13 guides is of critical value to researchers and drug developers, allowing for better gene knockdown and more time to study how the gene influences other genes in related pathways. CRISPR RNA guide delivery can be challenging, with knockdown time limited due to rapid guide degradation. We were inspired by the guide modifications developed for other DNA-targeting CRISPRs and wanted to test if chemically modified guides could improve knockdown time for RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 in human cells,  says Alejandro M ndez-Mancilla, PhD, a postdoctoral scientist in the lab and co-first author of the study.Drawing on the lab s previous study that outlined principles for optimal Cas13 guide design, published in Nature Biotechnology in March 2020, the researchers systematically applied and tested a variety of chemical modifications. For example, they found that adding 3 bases with a different type of chemical bond linking them to each other (phosphorothioate modification) extended RNA target knockdown ability by several days in a human cell line. In primary T cells, the phosphorothioate modification resulted in 60   65% knockdown of expression of CD46, a receptor involved in immune system regulation, as compared to achieving 40 - 45% knockdown when using an unmodified guide.The team also found that certain methylation and inverted terminator modifications also improved Cas13 activity. For all modifications, the placement of these modified RNA bases was also crucial. When placed incorrectly, the modifications resulted in guide RNAs that did not function.  We hope the improved effectiveness and stability from these modified CRISPR Cas13 guides will help pave the way for use of RNA-targeting CRISPRs in primary cells,  says Hans-Hermann Wessels, PhD, a postdoctoral scientist in the lab who is a co-first author of the study. These modified guides further expand the toolbox for genome and transcriptome engineering. For non-coding elements in the human genome, targeting DNA may not be effective, and other organisms, such as RNA viruses like coronavirus or flu, cannot be targeted at all,  said Dr. Sanjana, Core Faculty Member, NYGC, Assistant Professor of Biology, NYU, and Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the study s senior author.The team s test to knockdown the universal leader sequence segment of the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, for example, is only possible using an RNA-targeting CRISPR like Cas13. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells and releases its RNA genome, which is then transcribed into smaller RNAs, referred to as subgenomic RNAs. These subgenomic RNAs are responsible for making the different proteins required for the virus to replicate and then infect other cells. The universal leader sequence is found at the beginning of each subgenomic RNA. Thus, an effective approach for targeting the universal leader sequence may protect cells against further viral replication and infection.Also of key import is CRISPR-Cas13 s ability to modulate genetic expression without permanently altering the underlying DNA genome sequence, as do DNA-targeting CRISPRs like Cas9 or Cas12a.  Transient modulation to spur genetic expression outcomes is often preferred in biomedical research and drug development. For example, the messenger RNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 express transiently but create an immune memory that lasts beyond their expression lifetime,  notes Dr. Sanjana.Reference: M ndez-Mancilla A, Wessels H-H, Legut M, et al.

One of the challenges climate activists face is determining who exactly is to blame for the climate crisis,  Don Grant, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the paper, told VICE.  Our study begins to address this problem in identifying super polluters. For the study, Grant and his colleagues analyzed emissions data on more than 29,000 fossil-fuel power plants in 221 countries to identify the world s most prolific polluters. These power plants were uniformly coal-powered, highly inefficient, and concentrated in the Global North.The highest-emitting power plant is in Rogowiec, Poland, a facility that produces 20 percent of the nation s electricity but spewed 38 million tons of CO2 in 2018. Six of the 10 highest-emitting plants are in China and East Asia; two are in India; and two in Europe, including the Rogowiec facility.Researchers calculated how much  super polluters  could reduce emissions by boosting their efficiency, switching to lower-carbon fuels, or adding carbon-capture technology. The found that boosting efficiency at hyper-polluting power plants would cut total global power sector emissions by 25 percent. Switching from coal to oil or gas would lower emissions by around 30 percent, while installing carbon capture technology would slash emissions nearly in half. The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Findings suggest that instead of relying on sweeping environmental initiatives, substantial environmental progress can be made through selectively targeting nations  hyper-polluters   the worst-of-the-worst   that are responsible for the lion s share of their carbon pollution,  authors wrote.  As the fossil-fuel-burning energy infrastructure continues to expand and the urgency of combating climate change grows, nations will likely need to consider more expedient strategies of this sort.

A gene essential to the bacteria s lifecycle is discovered, scientists rush to develop drugs that inhibit the target, and then disappointment. Volleys of compounds hurled at the essential gene target have little impact on microbial growth. The bacteria live on. The scientists return to the drawing board. Now, a new study in Cell helps explain why target-based antibiotics have had so much trouble getting off the ground. One answer is that essential gene targets differ in their degree of vulnerability to antibiotics. An ideal target, the researchers found, is so vulnerable to attack that the cell cannot survive when it is even slightly inhibited. Invulnerable genes, on the other hand, can weather nearly total inhibition, eking out just enough target activity to keep the cell alive while beset with antibiotics. Further, the authors quantified vulnerability in a pathogen for the first time, producing an index that ranks almost every essential gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the amount of inhibition necessary to disable the gene and cripple the cell.  The failures of target-based drug discovery are often ascribed to problems with the compound, like its inability to cross the bacterial envelope,  says Jeremy Rock, head of The Rockefeller University s Laboratory of Host-Pathogen Biology.  This is the other side of that coin. If you pick a gene target that is highly invulnerable, you re just not setting yourself up for success.  ","Published: August 3, 2021"

In essence, the brain system that normally tracks economic value becomes very active and  talks  to the system that processes visual information. These value signals, much decried as the basis for marketing strategies, actually serve a crucial aspect of our intelligence. Value is used by the brain to select information and create mental abstractions. The study, published in the journal eLife, could open the way to new advances in basic research, education and rehabilitation, the treatment of psychiatric disorders, as well as for the development of novel algorithms in artificial intelligence. The international team tested people s ability to solve decision problems presented on a computer screen, while inside an MR scanner. When participants responded correctly, they were given a small reward. The problems could be solved according to two strategies: an inefficient one based on all the information presented on the screen, and a better one that required mental abstractions. By analysing the brain data with machine learning, the researchers found that when people used mental abstractions, this coincided with increased activity in the brain area that signals how valuable things are. In a second experiment the researchers used a novel neurofeedback technique to artificially change, directly in the brain, the value of some of the items used in the decision problems. After the manipulation, participants were more likely to use mental abstractions in those decision problems. Dr. Aurelio Cortese, Chief Researcher at the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Kyoto, that led the team, said: This study is quite unique in its kind in that a high level, complex function like abstraction was studied with basic visual stimuli and simple decision problems. Yet, this simplicity led us directly to the underlying mechanism, helping resolve a long-standing question in the neuroscience literature: why do we see value signals in the brain literally all the time? Mental abstractions may be the key   we constantly need to think in abstract terms, since our world would be too complex otherwise. Dr. Mitsuo Kawato, Director of the Computational Neuroscience Laboratories at ATR, Kyoto, was a co-author on the study, and explained the state-of-the-art neurofeedback manipulation: With machine learning and advanced neuroimaging, we can now detect when, and if, a mental representation appears in the brain below the awareness threshold, in real time. When we do so   we give our participants a small reward. With time, that mental representation becomes paired with reward, or in terms of this experiment, with value. This way, we were able to  trick  the brain into using these newly valuable mental representations to construct abstract thoughts. Dr. Benedetto De Martino, Professor at University College London, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, was the senior author on the study and a leading expert in neuroeconomics: The proposal that value   traditionally associated with its hedonic dimension (for example the value of a chocolate bar)   could be crucial for some aspects of our general intelligence is radical. Value may well be an abstraction in its own right. This research is part of our broader effort to understand the algorithmic nature of the human mind   and eventually translate this knowledge into new architectures in artificial intelligence, and lead to new treatments for psychiatric illnesses.

The study has now been published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. Chemically similar to nicotine, neonicotinoids are insecticides that protect against plant-consuming insects like aphids, but seriously harm beneficial insects, like bees. They are widely used by commercial growers.Much research has focused on their use in food crops like canola, in which they are typically applied at low doses. However, this study is one of the few to examine neonicotinoid application in potted ornamental plants, which can represent more potent, acute sources of exposure to the toxin for bees. Neonicotinoids are often used on food crops as a seed treatment,  explained UCR entomologist and lead study author Jacob Cecala.  But they re usually applied in higher amounts to ornamental plants for aesthetic reasons. The effects are deadly no matter how much the plants are watered. Cecala said he was surprised by this result, given that neonicotinoids are water soluble. Going into the study, he assumed that more water would dilute the amount of harm they caused the bees. The researchers were also curious whether increased watering could benefit bees despite insecticide exposure by increasing the quantity or quality of nectar offered by the plants.To test these assumptions, the researchers raised bees on flowering native plants in pots that either received a lot of watering, or a little. Plants were selected based on their popularity at nurseries, drought tolerance to ensure blooming even without much water, and their attractiveness to bees. In addition, half the plants were treated with the insecticide.Though increased water decreased the pesticide s potency in the nectar of the flowers, the negative effects on bees were still observed. Unfortunately, we observed a 90% decrease in the bees  reproduction with both high and low levels of irrigation,  Cecala said. This study is also one of the few to examine neonicotinoid effects via ornamental plants on solitary bees, which make up more than 90% of native bee species in North America, and an even higher percentage in California. Solitary bees are not bees who have left the hive and are now alone. This is a type of bee that lives alone, does not produce honey, and does not have a queen or live in a hive. Because they do not have a store of honey to protect, they are also not aggressive. Solitary bees are more representative of the ecosystem here, and they are potentially more vulnerable to pesticides,  said UCR entomologist and study co-author Erin Rankin. If a worker bee that is social   like the honeybee   gets exposed to insecticide and dies, it won t necessarily affect the longevity of the hive. However, if a solitary bee dies, its lineage is cut short. In this study, the researchers used alfalfa leafcutter bees, which make their nests in tunnels and lay eggs one at a time. They are very similar to California s solitary native bees and are part of a genus that can be found worldwide. The first time Cecala and Rankin tried this experiment, they used the concentration of insecticide recommended on the product label. All the bees died in a matter of days. The next time they ran the experiment, they used a third of the recommended dose and still found negative effects on reproduction, the ability of the bees to feed themselves, and overall fitness.  It almost completely wiped them out,  Cecala said. Though this study used a neonicotinoid product formulated for nurseries, formulations of similar products for home gardeners also tend to be highly concentrated.Plants in nurseries or residential backyards represent a smaller total area than food plant fields like corn or soy. However, high-potency neonicotinoid products can have a big effect even in small areas. In 2013, neonicotinoids applied to flowering trees in a retail parking lot in Oregon caused a massive bumblebee die off, with more than 25,000 found dead.The researchers recommend that nurseries quantify the amount of pesticides that are making their way into flowers given their watering and pesticide regimes, and consider alternative management practices that reduce harm to bees and the ecosystems dependent on them.  It s not as simple as  don t use pesticides    sometimes they re necessary,  Cecala said.  However, people can look for a different class of insecticide, try to apply them on plants that aren t attractive to bees, or find biological methods of pest control.

Drug development for Alzheimer s disease has run into challenges due to incomplete understanding of the disease s pathological mechanisms,  said Yanhong Shi, Ph.D., the Herbert Horvitz Professor in Neuroscience and director of the Division of Stem Cell Biology Research within the Department of Developmental and Stem Cell Biology at Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope. Preclinical research in this arena predominantly uses animal models, but there is a huge difference between humans and animals such as rodents, especially when it comes to brain architecture. We, at City of Hope, have created a miniature brain model that uses human stem cell technology to study Alzheimer s disease and, hopefully, to help find treatments for this devastating illness. City of Hope researchers were able to model sporadic Alzheimer s disease, the most common form of the condition, using  brain organoids  derived using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology. Because Alzheimer s is a disease of age, the scientists exposed the models to serum to mimic age-associated blood-brain barrier breakdown. Then they ran the organoids through different experiments to test known Alzheimer s biomarkers, including elevated levels of amyloid plaques and tau tangles as well as synaptic breaks linked to cognitive decline, among other pathological phenotypes brought on by the condition.More than 6 million people are living with Alzheimer s disease, which kills more people than breast and prostate cancer combined, reports the Alzheimer s Association. The heartbreaking degenerative disease affects not only the individual diagnosed with the condition, but also their primary caregiver, family and friends. No cure currently exists, and available treatments merely address symptoms rather than the root cause. Other studies using brain organoids to examine Alzheimer s disease used miniature brain models that are phenotypically young, but to truly understand what happens when Alzheimer s strikes, we need to use age-associated models, and that s what we did in this research project when we exposed the miniature brains to serum,  said Xianwei Chen, Ph.D., first author of the study and postdoctoral fellow at City of Hope.  We believe the age-associated brain organoids we generated will provide a powerful platform for us to find effective treatments for disorders affecting the human body s most complex organ. Preclinical research using brain organoids found that exposure to serum from blood could induce multiple Alzheimer s symptoms, suggesting combination therapies targeting multiple pathological alterations likely would be more effective than single-target therapies currently in development. The researchers studied late-onset or sporadic Alzheimer s disease, which accounts for most cases (95% sporadic vs. 5% inherited). They found that attempting a single therapy   for example inhibiting only amyloid or tau proteins   did not reduce the levels of tau or amyloid, respectively, suggesting that these two key biomarkers likely cause disease progression independently. Moreover, exposure to serum from blood   which mimics a leaky blood-brain barrier   could cause breaks in synaptic connections that help brains remember things and function properly.Matt Huentelman, Ph.D., professor of neurogenomics at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), said the brain model developed by City of Hope provides a new avenue for examining emerging treatments for this memory-robbing disease. Huentelman is a leading expert in the genetic study of Alzheimer s disease and was not part of this study. Using the model developed in this City of Hope-led study could help accelerate the evaluation of potential treatment options, giving a new sense of hope to Alzheimer s patients and their families,  he said.Reference: Chen X, Sun G, Tian E, et al.

These biomarkers are proteins, which predict cognitive decline and subsequent increased risk of dementia already 20 years before the disease onset.The proteins are related to immune system dysfunction, blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, vascular pathologies, and central insulin resistance. Six of these proteins can be modified with currently available medications prescribed for conditions other than dementia.  These findings provide novel avenues for further studies to examine whether drugs targeting these proteins could prevent or delay the development of dementia , says lead author Joni Lindbohm MD, PhD from the University College London and University of Helsinki.The results of the study have been published in the Alzheimer s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.New methods enable advances in dementia researchAmyloid beta and tau proteins have dominated pathophysiological research on dementia etiology, but to date prevention and treatment trials targeting these biomarkers have been unsuccessful. This has motivated researches to search also other potential mechanisms that could predispose to dementia. Recent development of scalable platforms has made it possible to analyze a wide range of circulating proteins, which may reveal novel biological processes linked to dementias.In this study the authors were able to analyze proteins with novel large-scale protein panel from stored blood samples of the British Whitehall II and US Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study collected 20 years ago. Using a panel of 5,000 proteins measured from plasma, the researchers identified proteins that predicted cognitive decline in 5-yearly screenings and subsequent onset of clinical dementia. The 15 proteins predicted dementia in both the British and US cohorts.Further research will provide more information to find drug targets This new study is the first step in our 5-year Wellcome Trust funded research programme. We will next examine whether the identified proteins have a causal association with dementia, and whether they are likely to be modifiable, and druggable , tells one of the authors, Professor Mika Kivim ki, Director of the Whitehall II study at University College London.The ultimate aim of the research programme is to identify novel drug targets for dementia prevention.Dementia rates and related cost are increasingThe global number of individuals living with dementia is approximately 45 million and the number is projected to two or three times higher in 2050. In USA the annual cost of care for those living with dementia have increased 35% since 2015 and are nearly one billion annually. It is the fifth leading cause of death globally and currently no cure for dementia causing diseases exist.Reference: Lindbohm JV, Mars N, Walker KA, et al.

The preclinical results could eventually lead to vaccines that cause the immune system to target cancers early in their development, preventing the disease from becoming established.The study, published July 2 in Gastroenterology, found that the vaccine reduced the tumor burden, prompted an immune response to cancerous cells and improved overall survival in an animal model of Lynch syndrome.Cancer vaccines are not a new idea. As part of their development, cancer cells often express proteins on their surface that don't normally appear on healthy cells. The immune system can naturally detect these abnormal antigens and destroy the tumors before they get established. This ""immune surveillance"" process isn't perfect, though, and it tends to weaken with age. In theory, a cancer vaccine could boost immunity against a particular type of tumor and reinvigorate immune surveillance against it. In practice, that approach has been hard to implement.""There have been many trials that have tried to use cancer vaccines as a therapy, not as a prevention, but those have largely been unsuccessful,"" said senior author Dr. Steven Lipkin, vice chair for research in the Weill Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and a medical geneticist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. That's because once tumors become established, they often develop strategies to suppress or evade the patient's natural immune response against them, rendering vaccines ineffective. ""However, we've known for many years that when cancers first start, when they're at the level of a single cancer cell that has just transformed or a few cancer cells, that's when they're most vulnerable,"" said Dr. Lipkin, who is also the Gladys and Roland Harriman Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.To begin developing a preventive cancer vaccine, Dr. Lipkin and his colleagues and collaborators targeted Lynch syndrome, the most common genetic predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer. About one in 280 people carry Lynch syndrome mutations, which cause defects in their DNA repair systems. Faulty repair of mutations during normal cell division predisposes them to cancer, especially in the intestinal tract. The mutations also cause the cancer cells to produce altered proteins, or neoantigens, that can be targeted by the immune system.Using a mouse model of Lynch syndrome, the investigators identified the most common neoantigens that appeared in the animals' tumors. ""We then used computational methods to predict which of those would be the most effective in a vaccine,"" said Dr. Lipkin. That process yielded four neoantigens that were widespread in the mouse tumors and also capable of stimulating strong immune responses. When the team vaccinated the Lynch syndrome mice with a combination of those four protein antigens, the animals developed robust immune responses against them, and subsequently had lower tumor burdens and survived longer than unvaccinated mice.The scientists have already started moving into human studies. A pioneering phase 1/2a clinical trial initiated by Heidelberg University Hospital demonstrated that neoantigen peptide vaccines are feasible and induce strong immune responses. In an alternative approach, Italian biotechnology company Nouscom has used an adenovirus-based vaccine - conceptually similar to the technology behind some of the major COVID-19 vaccines now in widespread use - to immunize patients with Lynch syndrome and advanced gastrointestinal tumors. ""It seems to be safe, which is good,"" said Dr. Lipkin. He adds that a larger study to test the efficacy of a Lynch syndrome tumor vaccine should get underway in 2022. Besides the adenovirus platform, Lipkin and his colleagues are also looking into developing messenger RNA-based cancer vaccines.Even modest success in the clinic could have a big impact. ""I'm not trying to say at all that this is the end of cancer, but ... even if you can reduce it by 10 percent, that's millions of lives saved, and if we can do it with minimal side effects, hopefully, that would be a godsend,"" said Dr. Lipkin.Reference: Gebert J, Gelincik O, Oezcan-Wahlbrink M, et al.

Over the last decade these two antibodies have become the mainstay of many treatments for lymphoma and more recently autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.However, not all patients respond and it has long remained speculation as to why this is the case. In one hypothesis, researchers speculated whether inherited genetic differences in FCGRs, might explain this difference. These single genetic changes, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be present throughout the population and can impact antibody binding. It was also speculated as to whether the same effect would be seen with rituximab as with obinutuzumab, as through antibody engineering obinutuzumab binds much more tightly to several FCGRs.The new study, published in the American Society of Hematology journal Blood Advances shows that these SNPs do not impact the therapeutic success of either antibody in either diffuse B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma.Professor Jon Strefford of the University of Southampton, who led this aspect of the work, said  This work is the culmination of five years of research, performed in close collaboration with our commercial partners. We have been able to demonstrate, in by far the most conclusive manner to date, that key SNPs in the FCGR genes do not influence the clinical outcome of patients with lymphoma treated with anti-CD20 antibodies, most notably whether an individual will develop aggressive disease despite treatment. This research will allow future studies to investigate other aspects of FCGR biology, helping us to understand why certain patients respond to these treatments whilst facilitating the development of the next generation of anti-CD20 therapies. A second hypothesis for why certain lymphoma patients may not respond effectively is due to the increased levels of another FCGR, FCGR2B, on the surface of the lymphoma cells. In earlier pre-clinical work the University of Southampton team including Dr Sean Lim, Professor Stephen Beers, Professor Martin Glennie and Professor Mark Cragg had observed that the FCGR2B could cause the rituximab antibody to be lost from the cell surfaces but that obinutuzumab was not effected in the same way.In the second paper published in Blood Advances, the team assessed this hypothesis in multiple clinical studies of DLBCL, including the GOYA trial of over 1200 patients   measuring the expression of the FCGR2B on the tumour and assessing its impact on clinical efficacy with rituximab or obinutuzumab.In all four clinical cohorts examined the authors saw evidence of the ability of high levels of FCGR2B on the tumour to prevent rituximab efficacy, independent of other established prognostic biomarkers. Moreover, in the GOYA trial they showed that obinutuzumab was not impacted in the same way, indicating this different antibody could more successfully treat patients with high FCGR2B on their tumour cells.  Professor Cragg who led this aspect of the work said  It is very satisfying to follow this work from initial lab studies in 2011 all the way through to clinical validation of the findings 10 years later. This finding may help to identify patients who would benefit most from different antibody treatments. The study was done in close collaboration with Roche as well as Blood Cancer UK and Cancer Research UK, who funded various aspects of the work.  Both Professor Cragg and Strefford noted that this work was only possible through the fantastic collaboration with their colleagues across the many sites and institutions.References:Strefford JC, Nowicka M, Hargreaves CE, et al.

Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and collaborating institutions have discovered that a cellular phenomenon called cryptic transcription, which had been previously described and linked to aging in yeasts and worms, is elevated in aging mammalian stem cells.The team reports in the journal Nature Aging that cryptic transcription occurs because a cellular mechanism that keeps it in check falls apart as cells get old. The findings suggest that strategies that control cryptic transcription could have pro-longevity effects. In previous work, we showed that cryptic transcription in yeasts and worms is not only a marker of aging but also a cause,  said corresponding author Dr. Weiwei Dang, assistant professor of molecular and human genetics and the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor.  Reducing the amount of this aberrant transcription in these organisms prolonged their lifespan. Cryptic transcription is a phenomenon that interferes with normal cellular processes. Normal gene transcription is a first step in the production of proteins. It begins in a specific location on the DNA called the promoter. This is where the protein coding gene begins to be transcribed into RNA, which is eventually translated into protein. Gene transcription is a well-regulated cellular process, but as cells age, they lose their ability to control it. Promoters have a specific DNA sequence that identifies the starting point of the transcription process that is usually located preceding the actual protein coding sequence,  explained Dang.  But promoter look-alike sequences do exist in other locations, including along the actual protein coding sequence, and they could start transcription and generate shorter transcripts, called cryptic transcripts. Here we investigated whether cryptic transcription increased with age in mammals and potential mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. The team worked with mammalian stem cells, which have shown to play a significant role in aging. They adapted a method to detect cryptic transcription to determine the level of this transcription in mice and human stem cells and cultured cells. When compared to young stem cells, older ones had increased cryptic transcription. They also looked into other aging cells and found that, in the majority of cells spanning a range of tissues, cryptic transcription was also elevated with age. Altogether, our findings indicate that elevated cryptic transcription is a hallmark of mammalian aging,  Dang said.Young cells have mechanisms in place to prevent cryptic transcription. In aged mammalian cells, the researchers found that one such mechanisms, which involves limiting the access to chromatin, the material that makes up the chromosomes, is failing, facilitating the production of cryptic transcripts. It is still not clear how elevated cryptic transcription contributes to aging, but the evidence is accumulating that it is detrimental to mammals as it is for yeast and worms,  Dang said.  Future studies may result in ways of reduce the pro-aging effects of cryptic transcription. Other contributors to this work include Brenna S.

Lysosomes were once believed to merely be the  garbage bin  of the stem cell, recycling waste material, regulating cellular regeneration and functioning the same in all cell types. But the PM team s research builds on new knowledge about lysosomes which shows they act as key signaling hubs, regulating long-term hematopoietic stem cells.Work done by the researchers examines why a hematopoietic stem cell can remain dormant for years, and how the lysosome constantly acts as a sensor even in that deeply inactive state. The Princess Margaret team found that in spite of the cell s dormancy, the lysosome inside it is still very active,  clipping and inactivating  receptors involved in growth signaling and nutrient transport within the stem cell membrane, allowing it to remain asleep.The findings could have implications beyond the study, potentially allowing for control of the balance between cell dormancy and when stem cells are activated to help replenish the blood supply.The results come from the laboratory of Princess Margaret senior scientist Dr. John Dick and are published in Cell Stem Cell. Post-doctoral fellow Dr. Laura Garcia-Prat is first author, and affiliate scientist Dr. Stephanie Xie is co-senior author along with Dr. Dick. The study has discovered a new mechanism of dormancy, which is to harness an organelle, a lysosome, and keep that cell dormant,  says Dr. Garcia-Prat.  This opens a way that lysosomes could potentially be harnessed as a therapeutic target. Every year, tens of thousands of people around the world receive bone marrow transplants to help fight leukemia. High doses of chemotherapy are used to kill the rapidly dividing cancer cells, but at the same time it also kills stem cells needed to reproduce healthy blood.Stem cell transplants are used to regenerate a patient s heathy blood supply, but finding a matching donor can be challenging, especially within different ethnic communities where donor lists may not be extensive or exist at all. Stem cells found in cord blood would have considerable value as additional donor sources, but the number of stem cells is often too low for an adult recipient. Understanding how to activate and expand stem cells in a controlled way could make cord blood more widely useful.Being able to control the activation of stem cells might also be useful for situations where stem cells are inappropriately activated due to disease, inflammation or drug treatment, helping to restore dormancy to conserve these valuable commodities. Learning how to conserve, and preserve, blood stem cells is vital,  says Dr. Dick.  If that stem cell gets activated in an inappropriate way that can have huge consequences for the blood system because you're now losing your stem cells and you're not going to have that for your lifetime. You've got to do everything you can to keep that cell dormant. And one way you do that is by preventing it from sensing any signals from the surface,  added Dr. Dick.The work could also be used to help more fully understand leukemia stem cells which closely mimic regular stem cells and sometimes are able to go dormant and evade treatments. Now it will be interesting to look at these leukemia stem cells and see how this mechanism is regulated,  says Dr. Stephanie Xie.  We may see differences and utilize them for treatment. Dr. Garcia-Prat, the lead author, said this is work could have only done at Dr. Dick s lab at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre at the University Health Network. We are one of the few labs in the world working with human hematopoietic stem cells,  says Dr. Garcia-Prat.

All these reactions are mediated via our brain, which has its own suite of responses to musical stimuli. Researchers at the ENS, part of PSL University, have gone a step further into the exploration of our brain's response to music. In a new body of work, they ask  an unusual question that takes full advantage of the brain s predictive abilities: what is our response to music that can t be heard?In a pair of studies published in the Journal of Neuroscience, ENS researchers, including Marion and Dr. Giovanni DiLiberto used electroencephalography (EEG), an electrophysiological technique that measures electrical signals from the brain via electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp, to measure brain signals taken from 21 trained musicians. The musicians were recorded when listening to periods of silence within melodies taken from the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and when imagining Bach s melodies while sitting in silence. These differences, however, happened in such a predictable fashion that the researchers were able to identify the heard melody just by analyzing the EEG signals produced during the imagery sessions.The researchers estimated expectations by building a statistical model that was fed with a huge variety of Western music. This model enabled the researchers to assess how well their participants  brains were predicting the notes they heard or imagined. Their analysis showed that, regardless of whether music was actually audible, their volunteers  brains predicted it in a very similar way.","Published: August 2, 2021"

These receptors play important roles in our body s use of cholesterol and glucose, among other critical processes. Nuclear receptors are the only class of DNA-binding proteins that are druggable. Drug development has been focused exclusively on designing artificial hormones that would replace the natural ones and activate the receptor because everyone believed that binding of the receptor to DNA was constant,  senior researcher Irina M. Bochkis said.  To everyone s surprise, we find that DNA needs to be opened for the receptor to bind. For different artificial hormones, distinct parts of DNA become accessible, some leading to beneficial and others to detrimental effects. If we can target the places in DNA that lead to favorable effects and avoid accessing sites that would lead to adverse ones, the efficacy of the drugs would be greatly improved.

While previous studies have reported a possible link between cooking with solid fuels and an increased risk of cataracts in women, it is unclear whether similar associations also exist with other major eye diseases, such as conjunctivitis, keratitis and glaucoma.The researchers from the University of Oxford s Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH) and the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking University, Beijing, analysed data from almost half a million Chinese adults in the China Kadoorie Biobank. All the study participants were asked about their cooking habits by questionnaire, then tracked for hospital admissions of major eye diseases through linkage to health insurance records. Over the ten-year follow-up period, there were 4,877 cases of conjunctiva disorders, 13,408 cataracts, 1,583 disorders of the sclera, cornea, iris and ciliary body (DSCIC), and 1,534 cases of glaucoma among study participants.Compared with those who cooked using clean fuels (electricity or gas), solid fuel users tended to be older, female, rural residents, less educated, agricultural workers and regular-smokers. After accounting for these factors properly, the results showed:Long-term use of solid fuels for cooking was associated with 32%, 17%, and 35% higher risks of conjunctiva, cataracts, and DSCIC, respectively, compared with those who cooked using clean fuels;There was little difference in risk between the different types of solid fuel used (for instance, coal versus wood);There was no association between long-term use of solid fuels and an increased risk of glaucoma;Individuals who switched from using solid to clean fuels for cooking had smaller elevated risks (over those who had always used clean fuels) compared to those who did not switch. People who switched had 21%, 5% and 21% higher risk for conjunctiva, cataracts, and DSCIC, respectively.Dr Peter Ka Hung Chan, research fellow in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, and lead author of the study, explained these findings:  The increased risks may be caused by exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide, which can damage the eye surface and cause inflammation. Burning wood also increases the risk of eye injury from sparks or wood dust. The investigators propose that the reason there was no association between solid fuel use and risk of glaucoma was because this disorder affects internal eye structures, which are less exposed to pollutants in the air.Among individuals who used solid fuels for cooking, the study did not find significant difference in excess risk between those with and those without cookstove ventilation (such as a chimney).In China, despite recent success from government-led clean stove initiatives, around 400 million people still used solid fuels for domestic purposes in 2018. Worldwide, the percentage of the global population relying on solid fuels for cooking has only decreased modestly since 2010, by 11%. Most of these people live in low-income countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. This can make it difficult for those affected by eye disorders to access effective and affordable treatment.Professor Zhengming Chen, Professor of Epidemiology and Director of China Programmes at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, and a senior author for the study, said,  Among Chinese adults, long-term solid fuel use for cooking was associated with higher risks of not only conjunctiva disorders but also cataracts and other more severe eye diseases. Switching to clean fuels appeared to mitigate the risks, underscoring the global health importance of promoting universal access to clean fuels. Professor Liming Li from Peking University and a senior author for the study, said,  Our study adds yet another piece of evidence to support governmental efforts to facilitate fuel transition, and the general public should be informed about the potential risks of eye diseases, some of which are highly disabling, related to solid fuel use. Commenting on the research, Imran Khan, Director of Programme Strategy & Development at international development organisation Sightsavers, commented:  Sightsavers s vision is of a world where no one is blind from avoidable causes and the study highlights that eye problems result from a number of factors, not just the traditional causes we commonly think of. Environmental factors and societal traditions, such as cooking with solid fuel, can have a big effect on eye health and show the need to work across all levels of health systems to improve outcomes. From government to communities, it s important to raise awareness of eye conditions, reduce these avoidable causes, and provide accessible health services.

Rowling or Stephen King.A recent study by University of Delaware researchers suggests exercise can boost kids  vocabulary growth. The article, published in the Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research, details one of the first studies on the effect of exercise on vocabulary learning in children.Children ages 6 to 12 were taught new words before doing one of three things   swimming, taking part in CrossFit exercises or completing a coloring sheet. The children who swam were 13% more accurate in follow up tests of the vocabulary words.It makes sense to the lead researcher, Maddy Pruitt, herself a former college swimmer who now regularly takes CrossFit classes.  Motor movement helps in encoding new words,  she said, explaining that exercise is known to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein Pruitt describes as the  Miracle-Gro of the brain. Why then, did swimming make a difference while CrossFit did not? Pruitt attributes it to the amount of energy each exercise demands of the brain. Swimming is an activity the kids could complete without much thought or instruction. It was more automatic, while the CrossFit exercises were new to them. The children needed to learn the moves, which required mental energy.Pruitt conducted the research as part of her Master s Capstone Project and graduated in 2020. She now works as a speech language pathologist at an elementary school in South Carolina, where she puts her findings into practice. My sessions are very rarely at a table,  she said.  I ll take my kids out to the playground or we ll take a walk around the school. Pruitt s adviser and coauthor Giovanna Morini is building on the findings in her lab. Morini, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, said most research into exercise examines it from the angle of a healthy lifestyle, not much enters the domain of language acquisition. She said she sees this as a rich line of inquiry and has another student running a similar experiment now with toddlers. We were so excited about this study because it applies to clinicians, caregivers and educators who can put it into practice,  Morini said.  It s simple stuff, nothing out of the ordinary.

But 66 million years ago, it may have meant the difference between life and death   and may help explain why birds are the only dinosaurs left on Earth.Research on a newly discovered bird fossil led by The University of Texas at Austin found that a unique brain shape may be why the ancestors of living birds survived the mass extinction that claimed all other known dinosaurs. Living birds have brains more complex than any known animals except mammals,  said lead investigator Christopher Torres, who conducted the research while earning a Ph.D. from the UT College of Natural Sciences and is now a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at Ohio University and research associate at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences.  This new fossil finally lets us test the idea that those brains played a major role in their survival. The fossil is about 70 million years old and has a nearly complete skull, a rare occurrence in the fossil record that allowed the scientists to compare the ancient bird to birds living today.The findings were published July 30 in the journal Science Advances.The fossil is a new specimen of a bird named Ichthyornis, which went extinct at the same time as other nonavian dinosaurs and lived in what is now Kansas during the late Cretaceous Period. Ichthyornis has a blend of avian and nonavian dinosaur-like characteristics   including jaws full of teeth but tipped with a beak. The intact skull let Torres and his collaborators get a closer look at the brain.Bird skulls wrap tightly around their brains. With CT-imaging data, the researchers used the skull of Ichthyornis like a mold to create a 3D replica of its brain called an endocast. They compared that endocast with ones created for living birds and more distant dinosaurian relatives.The researchers found that the brain of Ichthyornis had more in common with nonavian dinosaurs than living birds. In particular, the cerebral hemispheres   where higher cognitive functions such as speech, thought and emotion occur in humans   are much bigger in living birds than in Ichthyornis. That pattern suggests that these functions could be connected to surviving the mass extinction. If a feature of the brain affected survivorship, we would expect it to be present in the survivors but absent in the casualties, like Ichthyornis,  said Torres.  That s exactly what we see here. The search for skulls from early birds and closely related dinosaurs has been challenging paleontologists for centuries. Bird skeletons are notoriously brittle and rarely survive in the fossil record intact in three dimensions. Well-preserved skulls are particularly rare   but that s exactly what scientists need in order to understand what their brains were like in life. Ichthyornis is key to unraveling that mystery,  said Julia Clarke, a professor at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences and co-author of the study.  This fossil helps bring us much closer to answering some persistent questions concerning living birds and their survivorship among dinosaurs. Reference: Torres CR, Norell MA, Clarke JA.

The study also shows that large companies are far more transparent than smaller ones.The study, published in The BMJ Open (British Medical Journal), assessed the data-sharing practices of 42 pharmaceutical companies for clinical trials of 40 novel drugs and 22 biologics   products, such as vaccines, derived from living organisms   approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016 and 2017. The evaluation was performed using the Good Pharma Scorecard, a tool developed by researchers at Yale, Stanford, and Bioethics International which consists of transparency measures and a ranking system.Overall, only seven of the 42 companies, 17%, entirely met the tool s standards for transparency and sharing data. Smaller companies are particularly opaque, according to the study. The non-large pharmaceutical companies are dragging down the sector, often failing to meet federal reporting requirements, much less voluntary standards,  said Jennifer Miller, assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine, founder of Bioethics International   a nonprofit advocate for patient-centered medical innovation   and co-author of the study. The lack of transparency is a problem because access to robust clinical-trial data supports patient care and good science,  she added.  Full transparency allows scientists to learn from previous work and prevents people from being exposed to unnecessary experiments. Since the late 1990s, Congress and federal agencies have increased requirements for pharmaceutical companies to register and report results from clinical trials. Yet, some companies don t fully comply with the rules and industry guidelines vary.In a 2019 study using the transparency scorecard, 25% of companies fully met the standards, which include registering clinical trials, sharing data and study protocol publicly, and annually reporting requests for data. After companies received a 30-day window to improve their scores, the proportion of those meeting the standard rose to 33%.This earlier analysis was limited to large companies and novel drugs. For the latest study, the researchers expanded their assessment to include biologics and companies that fall outside the 20 largest globally by market capitalization.While 17% of companies achieved perfect scores, the assessment also found that 58% of the companies had publicly available results for all patient trials, 42% fully complied with federal reporting laws, and 26% fully met the scorecard s data-sharing measure. They also found that 26% of the products evaluated had publicly available results for all clinical trials supporting their FDA approval, and 67% had public results for patient trials within six months after their FDA approval.Non-large companies were less responsive than large companies when offered the 30-day window to fix errors and improve data-sharing practices, the researchers said. Four companies used the opportunity to improve their data-sharing procedures, raising the median data-sharing score for all companies from 60% to 69%. It s not surprising that non-large companies lag behind large as they may have fewer resources and smaller staffs with less compliance experience,  Miller said.  Our findings suggest that large companies may benefit from reviewing the transparency procedures of smaller companies before partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions so they don t inherit any deficiencies.

The world is facing growing food challenges as the human population continues to increase alongside its demand for resource intensive animal products. If these needs are to be met solely by conventional agriculture, the environmental cost will be huge. An international research team led by a G ttingen University alumnus has now shown that using solar-panels to produce microbial protein   which is rich not just in proteins but also in other nutrients   is more sustainable, efficient and environmentally friendly than growing conventional crops. This method uses solar energy, land, nutrients, and carbon dioxide from the air. Their research was published in PNAS.Using computer simulations drawing directly from laboratory results, the researchers modelled large-scale microbial food production facilities, which use solar energy, air, water, and nutrients to grow microbes. The protein-rich biomass is harvested and processed, and the resulting powder can be used as feed for animals, or as food for people. The study carried out an analysis of the energy requirements for each step, from the very start to the end product, taking into account: electricity generation (from solar panels), electrochemical production of energy-rich substrate for the microbes, microbe cultivation, harvesting, and processing the protein-rich biomass. Several types of microbes and growth strategies were compared in order to identify the most efficient. The study found that for each kilo of protein produced, solar-powered microbes require only 10% of the land area compared to even the most efficient plant crop   soybean. The study calculated that even in northern climates with less sunshine, the yields of solar-powered microbial foods could far outproduce staple crops, while minimizing water and fertilizer use. Importantly, this production could also be located in regions not suitable for agriculture, such as deserts. In previous research, the protein from these types of microbes has shown beneficial effects when fed to livestock and is already produced at large scale in the EU.  We expect that microbial protein will also be beneficial as a supplement to our diets, since it provides a high-quality protein source composed of all essential amino acids, as well as vitamins and minerals,  explains first author Dorian Leger, who carried out the work in the MPI of Molecular Plant Physiology while studying at the University of G ttingen, along with colleagues from Italy and Israel.  This technology has the potential to support food production while preventing damage to the environment. Current farming methods contribute to polluted ecosystems and depleted water reserves worldwide.  At the moment, 30-40% of the Earth s land is used for farming, yet one in ten people are undernourished. Leger says,  Integrating the cultivation of nutrient-rich microbes with renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, has the potential to produce more food with less resources. This could free up vast amounts of agricultural land, and, in addition, prevent the further destruction of natural ecosystems thereby making a valuable contribution to conservation and sustainability whilst promoting food availability globally.

Such harmful substances can not only cause ecological damage in the river. They can also deposit themselves on flooded areas and affect crops, grazing livestock and humans. This has been pointed out by an international research team in a review of scientific studies on flood events throughout the world. The paper has been published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials and was produced under the leadership of Goethe University.Sediments are regarded as a river s long-term memory. They mainly comprise particles that are eroded from the ground, ending up at some point in river deltas or the sea. However, sediments can also remain stable for a relatively long time   and bind pollutants which, for example, have entered the rivers through mining or industrial wastewater. As a consequence, many old river sediments contain pollutants as  chemical time bombs , such as heavy metals or dioxins and dioxin-like compounds that are not easily degradable. During flood events in the more industrial regions of Europe, North America and Asia, old sediments can be churned up as a result of the high speeds at which the water is flowing. In the process, the pollutants bound in them are regularly released in one go and contaminate flooded areas. An interdisciplinary team of researchers from Goethe University, RWTH Aachen University and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, along with other partners, has compiled a review of previous scientific studies on this topic. In it, the researchers, headed by junior research group leader Dr Sarah Crawford in Frankfurt and Canadian researcher Professor Markus Brinkmann, show, for example, which pollutant loads were measured after various flood events, which test systems were developed for different pollutants and how different sediments behave when water flows at high speeds. It describes the risks for drinking water production, the influence of temperature on pollutant intake by fish and methods for assessing the economic costs associated with the remobilisation of pollutants. Despite the many years of research on this subject, Henner Hollert, professor of environmental toxicology at Goethe University and senior author of the publication in hand, is greatly concerned:  I have the impression that the problem of pollutants from old sediments is greatly underestimated in Germany and also in Europe as a whole. One reason for this could also be that to date there have been practically no studies at all on the economic consequences of this problem, as we ve been able to show. However, contaminated sediments are a ticking time bomb that can explode each time there s a flood. What we need now is good river management across the board that not only looks at immediate hazards for humans, animals and infrastructure but also at the long-term consequences resulting from pollutants in the riverbeds. It s imperative, for example, that we examine flooded areas used agriculturally for river-specific pollutants so that these do not end up on our plates in the form of meat and dairy products.  In an interdisciplinary approach, researchers from Goethe University Frankfurt, in collaboration with RWTH Aachen University, the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, the Institute for Social-Ecological Research (ISOE), the Senckenberg Institute, the LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics and many other partners, are also studying the recent extreme flood events in Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia in terms of hydraulic engineering and the biological, ecotoxicological, ecological, geoscientific but also the social-ecological and economic consequences. These studies are embedded in the new research cluster RobustNature at Goethe University, which is examining the robustness and resilience of nature-society systems in the changing Anthropocene and aims to contribute to knowledge-based transformation research using the examples of biodiversity and water   that is, from knowledge to action.ReferenceCrawford SE, Brinkmann M, Ouellet JD, et al.

Veiseh and Miller will use insulin-producing beta cells made from human stem cells to create an implant that senses and regulates blood glucose levels by responding with the correct amount of insulin at a given time.Veiseh, an assistant professor of bioengineering, has spent more than a decade developing biomaterials that protect implanted cell therapies from the immune system. Miller, an associate professor of bioengineering, has spent more than 15 years researching techniques to 3D print tissues with vasculature, or networks of blood vessels.""If we really want to recapitulate what the pancreas normally does, we need vasculature,"" Veiseh said. ""And that's the purpose of this grant with JDRF. The pancreas naturally has all these blood vessels, and cells are organized in particular ways in the pancreas. Jordan and I want to print in the same orientation that exists in nature.""Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, the hormone that controls blood-sugar levels. About 1.6 million Americans live with Type 1 diabetes, and more than 100 cases are diagnosed each day. Type 1 diabetes can be managed with insulin injections. But balancing insulin intake with eating, exercise and other activities is difficult. Studies estimate that fewer than one-third of Type 1 diabetics in the U.S. consistently achieve target blood glucose levels.Veiseh's and Miller's goal is to show their implants can properly regulate blood glucose levels of diabetic mice for at least six months. To do that, they'll need to give their engineered beta cells the ability to respond to rapid changes in blood sugar levels.""We must get implanted cells in close proximity to the bloodstream so beta cells can sense and respond quickly to changes in blood glucose,"" Miller said.Ideally, insulin-producing cells will be no more than 100 microns from a blood vessel, he said.""We're using a combination of pre-vascularization through advanced 3D bioprinting and host-mediated vascular remodeling to give each implant several shots at host integration,"" Miller said.The insulin-producing cells will be protected with a hydrogel formulation developed by Veiseh, who is also a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar. The hydrogel material, which has proven effective for encapsulating cell treatments in bead-sized spheres, has pores small enough to keep the cells inside from being attacked by the immune system but large enough to allow passage of nutrients and life-giving insulin.""Blood vessels can go inside of them,"" Veiseh said of the hydrogel compartments. ""At the same time, we have our coating, our small molecules that prevent the body from rejecting the gel. So it should harmonize really well with the body.""If the implant is too slow to respond to high or low blood sugar levels, the delay can produce a roller coaster-like effect, where insulin levels repeatedly rise and fall to dangerous levels.""Addressing that delay is a huge problem in this field,"" Veiseh said. ""When you give the mouse -- and ultimately a human -- a glucose challenge that mimics eating a meal, how long does it take that information to reach our cells, and how quickly does the insulin come out?""By incorporating blood vessels in their implant, he and Miller hope to allow their beta-cell tissues to behave in a way that more closely mimics the natural behavior of the pancreas.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/what-is-the-mortality-cost-of-carbon-351522,What Is the Mortality Cost of Carbon  New metric accounting for future climate related deaths could greatly multiply the  social cost of carbon   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A just-published study coins a new metric: the ""mortality cost of carbon."" That is, how many future lives will be lost--or saved--depending on whether we increase or decrease our current carbon emissions. If the numbers hold up, they are quite high. The study was published today in the journal Nature Communications.Study author R. Daniel Bressler, a PhD. candidate at Columbia University's Earth Institute and the university's School of Public and International Affairs, saw a major gap in current estimates of the social cost of carbon--the dollar figure that economists attach to each ton of emissions, based on future damages it is expected to inflict. A complex and highly malleable number, the social cost of carbon underpins how governments worldwide formulate climate policies, by suggesting how much we should be willing to pay today in order to avert damages in the future. Yet, while recent studies project that climate change will cause millions of premature deaths, current estimates of the social cost of carbon rely on outdated research that does not include those projections. Bressler attempts to add in the new data.""Based on the decisions made by individuals, businesses or governments, this tells you how many lives will be lost, or saved,"" says Bressler. ""It quantifies the mortality impact of those decisions. It brings this question down to a more personal, understandable level.""First, the caveats. Bressler doesn't claim his number is definitive. He estimated the mortality impact of climate change based on several key public-health studies. But there is a lot of uncertainty in those studies; Bressler's main findings are based on their central estimates. For another, Bressler's study accounts only for direct temperature-related mortality, such as heat stroke; it leaves out possible deaths from storms, floods, crop failures, infectious diseases or wars--all widely predicted threats, but harder to quantify. He admits that his estimate could in fact ""be a vast underestimate.""Assuming that emissions continue to increase on their current high path, he came up with a number: 2.26 10-4, or 0.000226 excess deaths this century per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted beyond the current rate of emissions.Even Bressler found it hard to grasp what this number really meant, so he found another way to express it. That is: For every 4,434 metric tons of CO2 that we add beyond the 2020 rate of emissions, we will kill one person. Those 4,434 tons are equivalent to the current lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans; or, to put it in more personal terms, if we proceed on our current path, adding the current lifetime emissions of one American would theoretically kill 0.29 extra humans. That does not mean each living American is currently slated to kill 0.29 people-rather, it implies that adding 1,276 metric tons of carbon dioxide tons of carbon dioxide in 2020, equivalent to the lifetime emissions of one American, would kill 0.29 people this century through the effect on temperature-related mortality.This number compares unfavorably with most of the rest of the world. On a global average, 4,434 tons equals the lifetime emissions of 12.8 people (theoretically killing only 0.08 people per capita). Even in the relatively wealthy United Kingdom, it would take the current emissions of 9.4 citizens to produce the same amount of excess mortality (killing 0.11 per capita). It would take 25.8 Brazilians (killing 0.04 per capita); or 146.2 Nigerians (killing just 0.01 person per capita). A small number of countries come out looking worse than the United States, including oil-intensive Saudi Arabia (killing 0.33 people per capita). Also on that short list: Australia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.In bigger, less personal terms: adding 1 million metric tons to the 2020 baseline emissions would kill 226 people. Those 1 million tons equal the yearly emissions of 216,000 passenger vehicles; or, 115,000 homes; or 35 commercial airliners; or 0.24 coal-fired power plants.)The study assumes that on our current emissions path, by 2050, average temperatures will surpass 2.1 degrees C (3.8 F) above those of preindustrial times--the largely agreed-upon limit after which the worst consequences of climate change will kick in. After that, things would get much worse quickly, with temperatures reaching 4.1 degrees C (7.4 F) higher by 2100. Bressler projects that under this scenario, climate change would cause 83 million excess deaths by 2100.Since temperatures start hitting truly serious levels by 2050 under this scenario, most of the premature deaths would take place after that. The study does not explicitly look at geographic distribution, but Bressler says that most of the deaths would be in regions that are already the hottest and poorest: Africa, the Mideast and South Asia.How does this play into the social cost of carbon? If you accept the study's numbers, it skyrockets.Since its inception by the Nobel prize-winning economist William Nordhaus in the 1990s, the social cost of carbon has undergone many permutations, driven in particular by increasing understanding of the human impacts of climate change, along with shifting estimates of future temperatures and the degree to which we may be able to adapt to them. There are also competing models for totaling all the different factors into a single monetary figure.Nordhaus's commonly used DICE model, which Bressler builds on, currently puts the 2020 social cost of carbon at $37 per metric ton. This model suggests that in order to achieve the optimal balance between climate-related damages and the costs of cutting emissions, we should plateau emissions now, and cut gradually starting in 2050. This would result in 3.4 degrees C (6.1 F) of warming by 2100.But by adding in mortality to the model, Bressler puts the figure at $258 a ton--seven times more. This implies that we must cut emissions in a big way now, and reach full decarbonization by 2050. The result would be only 2.4 degrees of warming by 2100. As a result, by Bressler's calculation, excess deaths would drop to 9 million by 2100--a saving of 74 million lives. This is not necessarily a prescription for the optimal climate policy, he says--just an update to the DICE optimal policy.All these figures are subject to political finagling. In 2009, the Obama administration first mandated that scientists calculate a U.S. cost of carbon, and by 2017, the figure was $52. The Trump administration halted most scientific work on the question, and later came out with estimates ranging from about $15 to $1 a ton. When Joseph Biden took office, the scientists reassembled. An interim report issued in February puts the 2020 price back up to $51 a ton; a more official estimate is due by January 2022.""My view is that people shouldn't take their per-person mortality emissions too personally,"" says Bressler. ""Our emissions are very much a function of the technology and culture of the place that we live."" Individuals, companies and communities should certainly try to reduce their own emissions, he says. But a more effective answer, he says, would be ""large-scale policies such as carbon pricing, cap and trade, and investments in low-carbon technologies and energy storage.""Reference: Bressler RD.

It is estimated that more than 700 marine species, from blue whales to small barnacles, have had interactions with plastics in the oceans. Plastics now make up 80% of all marine debris and can be found everywhere, from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Plastics in the oceans come in the form of macroplastics (>1mm) and microplastics (<1mm).A new study published in Frontiers in Marine Science shows that small juvenile marine turtles from the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean have a very high incidence of plastic ingestion. Plastic ingestion and entanglement (which can cause suffocation) has now been documented for every species of marine turtle. Small juvenile turtles are thought to be most at risk, as this life stage is most prone to entanglement and ingestion due to their feeding preferences, while the oceanic zones they inhabit overlap with areas of high plastic pollution. Ingestion of plastic is thought to lead to mortality through laceration, obstruction, or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is also suspected to lead to malnutrition and chemical contamination.To study just how much and what type of plastics are ingested by small juvenile turtles, researchers examined the contents of the stomach, intestines, cloaca and bladder of stranded or bycaught specimens from the Indian Ocean off Western Australia and the Pacific Ocean off Eastern Australia. They looked for plastics inside green (36 in the Pacific and 22 in the Indian Ocean), loggerhead (7 and 14), olive ridley (seven in the Pacific), hawksbill (five and two), and flatback turtles (10 and 18). They classified plastics according to color and type (for example, hard plastics, rope, or plastic bags) and identified the sources of plastic polymers found. Plastics were only found in the gastrointestinal tract. The amount of plastics (>1mm) that were ingested varied by oceans and by species. The highest number of ingested plastic pieces occurred in green turtles: one animal in the Indian Ocean contained 343 pieces, and one animal in the Pacific Ocean contained 144. No plastic ingestion was found in sampled hawksbill turtles from either ocean, but this might have been due to the small sample size. The proportion of turtles that had ingested plastic was much higher in the Pacific Ocean than in the Indian Ocean. From the specimens collected from the Pacific Ocean, green turtles were most likely to contain plastics (83%), followed by loggerheads (86%), flatbacks (80%), and olive ridleys (29%). On the other hand, from the specimens from the Indian Ocean, the flatback turtles contained the most plastics (28%), followed by loggerheads (21%) and green turtles (9%). For green turtles in the Pacific Ocean, from 0% to 0.9% of the total body mass was ingested plastic, and from 0% to 2% for flatback turtles in the Indian Ocean. The types of plastic also varied between the two study sites.  Plastic in the Pacific turtles was mostly hard fragments, which could come from a vast range of products used by humans, while Indian Ocean plastics were mostly fibers   possibly from fishing ropes or nets,  says lead author Dr Emily Duncan of the University of Exeter.The researchers bring attention to the potential evolutionary trap that plastic pollution has created for juvenile turtles. An evolutionary trap occurs when a previously adaptive behavior or habitat now has negative effects on overall survival and reproduction. Post-hatchling turtles have adapted to enter the oceanic zone (for green, loggerhead, hawksbill, and olive ridley turtles) or neritic waters (flatback turtles) where they feed and grow into maturity. Normally, these habitats are ideal for their development, but the rapid introduction of plastic debris has made them risky for juvenile turtles. Actions to mitigate and prevent plastic pollution are necessary.  The polymers most commonly ingested by turtles in both oceans were polyethylene and polypropylene. These polymers are so widely used in plastic products that it's impossible to pin down the likely sources of the fragments we found, so interventions are needed to stop plastic pollution from land-based sources,  says Duncan.  The next stage of our research is to find out if and how plastic ingestion affects the health and survival of these turtles. This will require close collaboration with researchers and veterinarians around the world. ReferenceDuncan EM, Broderick AC, Critchell K, et al.

In somatic cells, scientists have observed that there is a correlation between this positioning and genome regulation. In fact, alterations in chromosome distribution have been related to certain diseases. Nevertheless, there are very few studies on chromosome territoriality in the cells that originate oocytes and spermatozoa (germ cells); cells that are subjected to a specific cell division process called meiosis.In a recent study addressed by the Genetics of Male Fertility research group of the Cell Biology Unit at the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona (UAB), the researchers designed and applied a methodology that has allowed the identification of mice male germ cells at different development stages, labeled all the chromosomes, capture three-dimensional images by confocal microscopy, and obtain numerical data on chromosome positioning.By applying this methodology, researchers observed that the chromosome positioning in the cells that produce spermatozoa was not random and  was directly related to the regulation of gene expression. We have demonstrated that the chromosomes with a higher gene activity are preferably located in the inner area of the cell nucleus, while those with less gene activity are located closer to the nuclear envelope. We were also able to conclude that chromosome positioning in relation to the longitudinal axis of the spermatozoa s nucleus was not random either; in other words, the chromosomes are arranged in an orderly manner from the top of the sperm s head to the beginning of its tail , explains Zaida Sarrate, researcher who coordinate the study.  We believe that this distribution plays a key role in the release of the paternal chromosomes into the oocyte after fertilization , she adds.Researchers suggest that an alteration in chromosome positioning during the formation of spermatozoa could result in a deregulation of chromosomal activity. In this sense, the development of this study has allowed describing a three-dimensional model of chromosome territoriality in the process of sperm formation, thereby setting down a solid starting point from which to conduct more studies aimed at discovering the effects that an altered chromosome positioning can have on fertility.Reference: Sol  M, Blanco J, Gil D, et al.

But unlike routine blood tests for cholesterol and hormone levels, there s no easy way to precisely measure a person s individual circadian rhythm.At least not yet.New CU Boulder research, published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms, suggests that day could come in the not-too-distant future. The study found it s possible to determine the timing of a person s internal circadian or biological clock by analyzing a combination of molecules in a single blood draw. If we can understand each individual person s circadian clock, we can potentially prescribe the optimal time of day for them to be eating or exercising or taking medication,  said senior author Christopher Depner, who conducted the study while an assistant professor of integrative physiology at CU Boulder.  From a personalized medicine perspective, it could be groundbreaking. Syncing our life with our clockFor decades, researchers have known that a central  master clock  in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus helps to regulate the body s 24-hour cycle, including when we naturally feel sleepy at night and have the urge to wake up in the morning. More recently, studies reveal that nearly every tissue or organ in the body also has an internal timing device, synced with that master clock, dictating when we secrete certain hormones, how our heart and lungs function throughout the day, the cadence of our metabolism of fats and sugars, and more.As many as 82% of protein-coding genes that are drug targets show 24-hour time-of-day patterns, suggesting many medications could work better and yield fewer side effects if administration was timed appropriately.And when our internal rhythm is at odds with our sleep-wake cycle, that can boost risk of an array of diseases, said study co-author Ken Wright, a professor of integrative physiology and director of the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at CU Boulder. If we want to be able to fix the timing of a person s circadian rhythm, we need to know what that timing is,  he said.  Right now, we do not have an easy way to do that.  Even among healthy people, sleep-wake cycles can vary by four to six hours. Simply asking someone,  are you a morning lark, a night owl or somewhere in-between?  can provide hints to what a person s circadian cycle is.But the only way to precisely gauge the timing of an individual s circadian clock (including where the peaks and troughs of their daily rhythm) is to perform a dim-light melatonin assessment. This involves keeping the person in dim light and drawing blood or saliva hourly for up to 24 hours to measure melatonin the hormone that naturally increases in the body to signal bedtime and wanes to help wake us up.A molecular fingerprint for circadian rhythmIn pursuit of a more precise and practical test, Wright and Depner brought 16 volunteers to live in a sleep lab on the CU Anschutz Medical campus in Aurora for 14 days under tightly controlled conditions.In addition to testing their blood for melatonin hourly, they also used a method called  metabolomics assessing levels of about 4,000 different metabolites (things like amino acids, vitamins and fatty acids that are byproducts of metabolism) in the blood.They used a machine learning algorithm to determine which collection of metabolites were associated with the circadian clock creating a sort of molecular fingerprint for individual circadian phases.When they tried to predict circadian phase based on this fingerprint from a single blood draw, their findings were surprisingly similar to those using the more arduous melatonin test. It was within about one hour of the gold standard of taking blood every hour around the clock,  said Depner, now an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Utah.He noted the test was significantly more accurate when people were well rested and hadn t eaten recently a requirement that could make the test challenging outside of a laboratory setting. And to be feasible and affordable, a commercial test would likely have to narrow down the number of metabolites it s looking for (their test narrowed it down to 65).But the study is a critical first step, said Wright. We are at the very beginning stages of developing these biomarkers for circadian rhythm, but this promising study shows it can be done.  Other research, including some from Wright s lab, is exploring proteomics (looking for proteins in blood) or transcriptomics (measuring the presence of ribonucleic acid, or RNA) to assess circadian phase.Ultimately, the researchers imagine a day when people can, during a routine physical, get a blood test to precisely determine their circadian phase so doctors can prescribe not only what to do, but when. This is an important step forward in paving the way for circadian medicine for providing the right treatment to the right individual at the right time of day,  said Depner.Reference: Cogswell D, Bisesi P, Markwald RR, et al.

That could change how medicine treats schizophrenia, epilepsy and other brain disorders.Our brains are responsible for coordinating and interpreting many of the actions we take for granted every day, from walking and running to seeing and hearing. To coordinate the sensory and motor signals firing across the brain requires a relay station of sorts, in this case, the thalamus, two small lobes that sit approximately midbrain.Neurons inside the thalamus have been traditionally difficult to study, but understanding how they help receive and transmit vital signals for sensory and motor skills may one day lead to new medical care for people with certain brain disorders.New work conducted by researchers from the University of Chicago and the U.S. Department of Energy s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have revealed a previously undetected convergence, or a merging, of sensory and motor information in the thalamus that might lead science one step closer to such treatments.Scientists believe the thalamus helps relay sensory and motor signals and regulate consciousness and alertness. But this new research reveals a greater complexity in how the thalamus receives different types of information and relays it to all parts of the cortex.The team s research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.To develop this more inclusive picture of the role of the thalamus, the team relied on tools from a variety of scientific fields, including genetics, virology, molecular biology and microbiology, as well as various imaging techniques.  Argonne s tools helped us to discover this convergence that we would never have seen otherwise,  said Vandana Sampathkumar, a neurobiologist in Argonne s Biosciences division and postdoctoral scholar at UChicago.The team used electron microscopy to collect thousands of images from mouse brains. Images were digitally reassembled, or stitched together, onto local desktops, and then aligned on Argonne s visualization computer, Cooley, for 3D reconstruction. We went in with the hypothesis that cells receive information from one place and send that information with minimal alteration to another place. But that was, in fact, not the case,  said Sampathkumar.  There was a surprising number of cells receiving information from different places and integrating it before passing it on. It has  many messy, complicated diverse inputs and outputs,  added Andrew J. Miller-Hansen, a UChicago neuroscience student and a member of the team.Through the image reconstructions, the team found that individual neurons can merge signals coming from different regions of the cortex. For example, a single neuron in a region of the thalamus called the posterior medial nucleus (Pom) could receive both sensory and motor information. They also determined that POm neurons receive similar inputs from unknown sources,  suggesting even greater integration of information than our data directly show,  the paper noted. Our understanding of how sensory and motor information is integrated in the thalamus will be important to learning how information flows generally in the brain,  said Miller-Hansen.  We want to know whether this pattern of convergence is specific to sensory and motor integration or if it s a common circuit pattern supporting other forms of integration in the brain. By clarifying the processing and signaling capabilities of neurons in the thalamus, this new information could help find treatments for schizophrenia, some forms of epilepsy and other brain disorders, where the thalamic dysfunction seems related to the clinical problems.Reference: Sampathkumar V, Miller-Hansen A, Sherman SM, Kasthuri N.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/treating-alcohol-use-disorder-with-a-dual-drug-therapy-351512,Treating Alcohol Use Disorder With a Dual Drug Therapy Scientists have leveraged two new drug molecules  one of which is currently being tested in cancer clinical trials  to create a dual drug therapy for alcohol use disorder  while avoiding side effects associated with existing treatment regimens  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. UCSF researchers have leveraged two new molecules, one of which is currently in clinical oncology trials, to devise a dual-drug therapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD), without the side effects or complications associated with current treatment regimens. The approach had highly successful results in mice and may be applicable to other drugs that are often abused. At the root of the team s thinking is the idea that AUD and other substance abuse disorders are the result of reinforced pathways in the brain, and that those pathways can be blocked or redirected, ending cravings and habitual behavior.  Alcohol use disorder is really a process of maladapted learning and memory,  said Dorit Ron, PhD, a professor of neurology and senior author on the study, published July 27 in Nature Communications.  Alcohol is rewarding, and we learn to associate alcohol, and even the environment in which we drink the alcohol, with that reward. Current pharmaceutical options for AUD attempt to change behavior by making alcohol consumption an unpleasant experience and some require patients to abstain for several days before beginning treatment. Since 2010, Ron, who is also faculty in the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, has taken a different approach, studying the role of the enzyme mTORC1 in the creation of those memories and associations, with the goal of creating an effective drug that can treat the neurological causes of AUD. Ordinarily, mTORC1 is involved in brain plasticity, helping to create connections between neurons that reinforce memory. In previous work, Ron showed that consuming alcohol activates the enzyme in the brain. Ron has also shown that blocking the activity of mTORC1 with the FDA-approved compound rapamycin, used to treat some types of cancer and suppress immune response in transplant patients, can halt cravings in mice engineered for alcohol use disorder. But mTORC1 contributes to a bevy of other bodily tasks related to metabolism and liver function, and people taking it for an extended period often develop liver toxicity, glucose intolerance, and other side effects. For some of her previous work, Ron had teamed up with Kevan Shokat, PhD, a professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology, who had created RapaLink-1, a molecule similar to rapamycin, which he designed specifically to keep a tight grip on mTORC1 and completely subdue it. A version of the drug is now being tested in oncology clinical trials. Shokat s thought was that, since Ron is concerned only with the activity of mTORC1 in the brain, that s the only place where RapaLink-1 or rapamycin needs to be effective. So Ziyang Zhang, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Shokat s lab, designed a second molecule that would latch onto RapaLink-1 or rapamycin essentially negating its effect while at the same time being too big to cross the blood-brain barrier. In other words, Shokat reasoned that RapaLink-1 or rapamycin could administered and allowed to circulate throughout the body. Once it had a chance to reach the brain, Rapablock could be given, halting the activity of Rapalink-1 everywhere except in that targeted area. The tactic worked like a charm when it was tested on the mice by Yann Ehinger, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Ron s lab.  We could see these side effects in mice who are taking rapamycin or RapaLink-1, and then when you give Rapablock, it s like magic, the side effects are gone,  said Ron. Shokat said a similar strategy is being explored in treating other conditions, such as Parkinson s disease. Those trials involve different drugs, but the underlying principle is the same: one drug results in the desired effect in the brain, while its activity is blocked by a molecule that isn t able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Ron believes that tackling addiction from this neurological perspective has potential for broad applications. She notes that while we see addiction with a wide chemical array of molecules alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, opiates, and the like the addictive behavior that results from each is the same.  It s really quite striking,  she said, adding that a whole body of study points to the possibility of mTORC1 being a kind of supermolecule that is activated by all misused drugs.  If that s true,  Ron said,  It suggests that this approach can be applied to other drugs of abuse as well, essentially solving the problem of addiction.

Understanding how hundreds of disparate cell types arise has proven difficult, largely because scientists have lacked the technologies to capture cellular decision making over time.Recent advances have allowed researchers to measure changes in gene activity of individual cells, so several groups started to study in detail how specialized cell types are formed in specific brain regions. However, nobody had thus far traced the patterns of gene expression across the entire developing brain.Now, for the first time, EPFL researchers and their collaborators at Karolinska Institute in Sweden mapped the genetic and developmental trajectories that embryonic cells follow toward their fate in the maturing brain. This molecular atlas could not only help better understand the healthy and diseased brain, but also improve therapeutic approaches such as cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, says study lead author Gioele La Manno, head of the Laboratory of Neurodevelopmental Systems Biology at EPFL. The findings were published in Nature.To monitor decision making in individual cells over time, La Manno and his colleagues analyzed brain samples from mouse embryos every day from day 7 after fertilization until birth. Using a combination of powerful sequencing techniques and mathematical methods, the researchers obtained about 290 000 gene expression profiles of individual cells from all brain regions, as well as nearly 800 cellular  states  that included the developmental programs for different cells, including neurons and neuronal support cells.As neuronal progenitors mature, they stop proliferating and differentiate into scores of different neurons. The researchers tracked the emergence of this diversity and described the timing of appearance of primitive nerve cells, called neuroblasts, across different brain regions. In mice, the first neuroblasts appear early, before day 9 of embryonic development   which roughly corresponds to the beginning of the first pregnancy trimester in humans. These pioneer neurons are involved in sensory and motor functions, the researchers found.  One of the first things to do is to set up the motor and sensory functions, because if you don t set these up early, later on it will become more difficult to build  highways  towards the periphery,  La Manno says.The researchers also found specific types of neuronal progenitors, called organizer radial glial cells, whose role is to guide the development of neighboring cells by producing molecular messengers that help establish the position of various specialized cell types within the brain.  If the brain were an orchestra, organizer radial glial cells would be the director,  La Manno says. These radial glial cells produce a greater variety of molecular messengers than scientists thought, the team found.The analysis also allowed the researchers to identify cell populations of different sizes, with some populations made of 100 times more cells than others. One of the biggest populations appears to be that of excitatory neurons in the forebrain, an area that comprises most regions involved in higher-order cognition. One of the smallest populations identified was that of a type of neuronal support cell called ependymal cells, which produce the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.La Manno hopes that the wealth of information contained in this brain atlas could help identify genes involved in neurodevelopmental conditions and determine the origin of malignant cells in brain cancer. The atlas, he says, could also serve as a reference to evaluate brain tissues generated from stem cells in a laboratory dish. To help others study cells and tissues of medical interest, the researchers made the atlas publicly available as a browsable web resource.Next, La Manno plans to uncover where in the developing brain the different cell populations are located.  The current atlas is a molecular chart that tells you which kind of cells are similar and which ones are different,  La Manno says.  Now, we want to see where these cells sit within the brain.

In all-female weevil species that produce only female offspring from unfertilized eggs, the insects  survival techniques have led to the surprising discovery that these creatures can pass down gene regulation changes to future generations. New research from Wellesley College has found that two types of weevils, common yet invasive beetles in many parts of the world, have been using epigenetic changes to adapt and respond to different toxins in the plants they eat. The findings, published in PLOS ONE under the title  Host-Specific Gene Expression as a Tool for Introduction Success in Naupactus Parthenogenetic Weevils,  have implications for how we consider asexual invaders and how successful they can be because of gene regulation. The researchers, led by Andrea Sequeira, Wellesley College Gordon and Althea Lang  26 Professor of Biological Sciences, collected samples of parthenogenetic, invasive, and polyphagous weevils, Naupactus cervinus and N. leucoloma, from Florida, California, and Argentina over the course of five years, starting in 2015. Despite being from different locations within the United States where they have been introduced, often through commerce, the weevils are asexual and genetically identical. Yet the team found that they have uniquely adapted to produce different proteins that allow them to eat and digest a variety of plants, even those that produce toxins.Sequeira worked with a talented team: Ava Mackay-Smith, Mary Kate Dornon, Rosalind Lucier, Anna Okimoto, and Flavia Mendonca de Sousa from Wellesley College, and Marcela Rodriguero, Viviana Confalonieri, Analia Lanteri from the University of Buenos Aires and the Museo de Ciencias Naturales in La Plata, Argentina. Together, they analyzed patterns of gene expression in three gene categories that can mediate weevil-host plant interactions through identification of suitable host plants, short-term acclimation to host plant defenses, and long-term adaptation to host plant defenses and their pathogens. We found that some host plant groups, such as legumes, appear to be more taxing for weevils and elicit a complex gene expression response,  Sequeira said.  However, the weevil response to taxing host plants shares many differentially expressed genes with other stressful situations, such as organic cultivation conditions and transition to novel hosts, suggesting that there is an evolutionarily favorable shared gene expression regime for responding to different types of stressful situations. We also found that mothers are able to  prime  their young with these epigenetic changes,  lead author and 2020 Wellesley College alumna Ava Mackay-Smith said.  Originally, we thought that these changes would only be seen in a single generation. When we studied larvae, who do not yet have mouths or eat plants, we found evidence of the same proteins and adaptations from their mothers.  Sequeira noted this finding is especially important because classic understanding has been that in both sexual and asexual reproduction, all epigenetic marks are erased between generations and each generation starts over.  These mothers are essentially giving their offspring a pep talk, and preparing them for the harsh realities of the herbivorous insect world, by passing down these gene regulation  tips  from one generation to the next.  Mackay-Smith believes that having a better understanding of epigenetic changes in invasive, asexual species may eventually help regulate or mitigate their potential negative impact on an environment, native plants, or crops, for example.  Knowing what is in this insect s repertoire, you could imagine that since we ve now identified the proteins that are regulated differently, you could target a specific protein and design a targeted pesticide that removes only that species of weevil, without harming other native insects or fauna. Both Mackay-Smith and Sequeira are excited to see that perhaps genetic variation is not the only form of heritable variation for natural selection to act upon and that epigenetic processes may increase the evolutionary potential of organisms in response to stress and other environmental challenges adaptations that could be relevant in the context of climate change.Reference: Mackay-Smith A, Dornon MK, Lucier R, et al.

Overcoming this barrier may be a first step in returning inner ear cells to a newborn-like state that s primed for regeneration, as described in a new study published in Developmental Cell. Permanent hearing loss affects more than 60 percent of the population that reaches retirement age,  said Segil, who is a Professor in the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and the USC Tina and Rick Caruso Department of Otolaryngology   Head and Neck Surgery.  Our study suggests new gene engineering approaches that could be used to channel some of the same regenerative capability present in embryonic inner ear cells. In the inner ear, the hearing organ, which is the cochlea, contains two major types of sensory cells:  hair cells  that have hair-like cellular projections that receive sound vibrations; and so-called  supporting cells  that play important structural and functional roles.When the delicate hair cells incur damage from loud noises, certain prescription drugs, or other harmful agents, the resulting hearing loss is permanent in older mammals. However, for the first few days of life, lab mice retain an ability for supporting cells to transform into hair cells through a process known as  transdifferentiation , allowing recovery from hearing loss. By one week of age, mice lose this regenerative capacity also lost in humans, probably before birth.Based on these observations, postdoctoral scholar Litao Tao, PhD, graduate student Haoze (Vincent) Yu, and their colleagues took a closer look at neonatal changes that cause supporting cells to lose their potential for transdifferentiation.In supporting cells, the hundreds of genes that instruct transdifferentiation into hair cells are normally turned off. To turn genes on and off, the body relies on activating and repressive molecules that decorate the proteins known as histones.  In response to these decorations known as  epigenetic modifications,  the histone proteins wrap the DNA into each cell nucleus, controlling which genes are turned  on  by being loosely wrapped and accessible, and which are turned  off  by being tightly wrapped and inaccessible. In this way, epigenetic modifications regulate gene activity and control the emergent properties of the genome.In the supporting cells of the newborn mouse cochlea, the scientists found that hair cell genes were suppressed by both the lack of an activating molecule, H3K27ac, and the presence of the repressive molecule, H3K27me3.  However, at the same time, in the newborn mouse supporting cells, the hair cell genes were kept  primed  to activate by the presence of yet a different histone decoration, H3K4me1.  During transdifferentiation of a supporting cell to a hair cell, the presence of H3K4me1 is crucial to activate the correct genes for hair cell development.Unfortunately with age, the supporting cells of the cochlea gradually lost H3K4me1, causing them to exit the primed state. However, if the scientists added a drug to prevent the loss of H3K4me1, the supporting cells remained temporarily primed for transdifferentiation. Likewise, supporting cells from the vestibular system, which naturally maintained H3K4me1, were still primed for transdifferentiation into adulthood. Our study raises the possibility of using therapeutic drugs, gene editing, or other strategies to make epigenetic modifications that tap into the latent regenerative capacity of inner ear cells as a way to restore hearing,  said Segil.  Similar epigenetic modifications may also prove useful in other non-regenerating tissues, such as the retina, kidney, lung, and heart. Reference: Tao L, Yu HV, Llamas J, et al.

Cancers result from DNA mutations that allow defective cells to survive and invade other tissues. However, in most cases, the source of these mutations is not clear, which complicates development of therapies and prevention methods,  said Gerd Pfeifer, Ph.D., a VAI professor and the study s corresponding author.  In melanoma, we ve now shown that damage from sunlight primes the DNA by creating  premutations  that then give way to full mutations during DNA replication. Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer that begins in pigment-producing skin cells. Although less common than other types of skin cancer, melanoma is more likely to spread and invade other tissues, which significantly reduces patient survival. Previous large-scale sequencing studies have shown that melanoma has the most DNA mutations of any cancer. Like other skin cancers, melanoma is linked to sun exposure, specifically a type of radiation called UVB. Exposure to UVB damages skin cells as well as the DNA within cells.Most cancers are thought to begin when DNA damage directly causes a mutation that is then copied into subsequent generations of cells during normal cellular replication. In the case of melanoma, however, Pfeifer and his team found a different mechanism that produces disease-causing mutations   the introduction of a chemical base not normally found in DNA that makes it prone to mutation.DNA comprises four chemical bases that exist in pairs  adenine (A) and thymine (T), and cytosine (C) and guanine (G). Different sequences of these pairs encode all of the instructions for life. In melanoma, the problem occurs when UVB radiation from the sun hits certain sequences of bases   CC, TT, TC and CT   causing them to chemically link together and become unstable. The resulting instability causes a chemical change to cytosine that transforms it into uracil, a chemical base found in the messenger molecule RNA but not in DNA. This change, called a  premutation,  primes the DNA to mutate during normal cell replication, thereby causing alterations that underlie melanoma.These mutations may not cause disease right away; instead, they may lay dormant for years. They also can accumulate as time goes on and a person s lifetime exposure to sunlight increases, resulting in a tough-to-treat cancer that evades many therapeutic options. Safe sun practices are very important. In our study, 10 15 minutes of exposure to UVB light was equivalent to what a person would experience at high noon, and was sufficient to cause premutations,  Pfeifer said.  While our cells have built-in safeguards to repair DNA damage, this process occasionally lets something slip by. Protecting the skin is generally the best bet when it comes to melanoma prevention. The findings were made possible using a method developed by Pfeifer s lab called Circle Damage Sequencing, which allows scientists to  break  DNA at each point where damage occurs. They then coax the DNA into circles, which are replicated thousands of times using a technology called PCR. Once they have enough DNA, they use next-generation sequencing to identify which DNA bases are present at the breaks. Going forward, Pfeifer and colleagues plan to use this powerful technique to investigate other types of DNA damage in different kinds of cancer.

The major mechanism of melanoma mutations is based on deamination of cytosine in pyrimidine dimers as determined by circle damage sequencing.

Lee Kraus, Ph.D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pharmacology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Many researchers are trying to find dependencies in cancers by asking why a cancer cell amplifies a gene, increases the levels of a protein, or upregulates a critical cellular pathway. These changes give that cancer a selective advantage, but at the same time they can become an Achilles  heel   something that, if the alteration was blocked, would kill the cancer or stop its growth,  he said.Dr. Kraus and his team, including lead author Sridevi Challa, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the lab, found that ovarian cancers massively amplify an enzyme, NMNAT-2, that makes NAD+. NAD+ is the substrate for a family of enzymes called PARPs, which chemically modify proteins with ADP-ribose from NAD+. In this study, the team found that one PARP family member, PARP-16, uses NAD+ to modify ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machines of the cell.A challenge for this work was that a single ADP-ribose group attached to a protein is difficult to detect. Dr. Kraus and his team overcame this problem by developing a synthetic mono(ADP-ribose) detection reagent made up of natural protein domains fused together, which can be used to detect ADP-ribosylated proteins in cells and patient samples.In collaboration with UT Southwestern clinicians, led by Jayanthi Lea, M.D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and member of the Simmons Cancer Center, Dr. Kraus and his team screened human ovarian cancer patient samples using the mono(ADP-ribose) detection reagent to identify those with low or high levels of mono(ADP-ribose). We were able to show that when ribosomes are mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated in ovarian cancer cells, the modification changes the way they translate mRNAs into proteins,  Dr. Kraus said.  The ovarian cancers amplify NMNAT-2 to increase the levels of NAD+ available for PARP-16 to mono(ADP-ribosyl)ate ribosomes, giving them a selective advantage by allowing them to fine-tune the levels of translation and prevent toxic protein aggregation. But that selective advantage also becomes their Achilles  heel. They re addicted to NMNAT-2, so inhibition or reduction of NMNAT-2 inhibits the growth of the cancer cells. This study identified mono(ADP-ribose) and NMNAT-2 as potential biomarkers for ovarian cancers, which may allow clinicians to determine which ovarian cancer patients may respond well and which will not. Even more ovarian cancer patients might do well if an inhibitor is developed for PARP-16, which blocks ribosome mono(ADP-ribosyl)nation.Dr. Kraus, an expert in PARPs, said medical science has had great success in developing FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors, and an inhibitor for PARP-16 is likely. No PARP-16 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, but labs in academia and the pharmaceutical industry are developing specific and potent inhibitors of PARP-16. Such a drug could be an effective therapeutic for treating ovarian cancers,  he said.Dr. Kraus is a founder and consultant for Ribon Therapeutics Inc., and ARase Therapeutics Inc. He is also co-holder of U.S. patent 9,599,606 covering the mono(ADP-ribose) detection reagent, which has been licensed to and is sold by EMD Millipore. Dr. Kraus  research is not just a great advance in basic science. It has real promise for clinician investigators and cancer care practitioners because it shows a biomarker and a pathway a future drug could target. The fact that technology developed in his laboratory helped make these findings shows how our faculty builds on their findings to break new ground,  said Carlos L. Arteaga, M.D., Director of the Simmons Cancer Center.Other researchers who contributed to this study include Beman R. Khulpateea, Tulip Nandu, Cristel V. Camacho, Keun W. Ryu, Hao Chen, and Yan Peng.

It is estimated that 1% of the population suffer from this disease. To be able to diagnose celiac disease it is necessary at present to carry out an endoscopy, a test that is not only highly unpleasant, but also costly and in some cases unnecessary. Patients with symptoms of celiac disease undergo an endoscopy, but the symptoms, such as stomach pain, weight loss or anaemia, are very common, and are similar to those of other disorders of the digestive system. In turn, the genetic variant conferring an increased risk of developing celiac disease is present in a high percentage of the healthy population. So many non-celiac patients with symptoms and who are at a genetic risk are needlessly subjected to an endoscopy.In collaboration with the Biodonostia and Biocruces Institutes and the Txagorritxu and Galdakao Hospitals, researchers from Ikerbasque and the UPV/EHU have now developed a non-invasive method to help diagnose celiac disease and which uses saliva. This research has shown that it is possible to considerably reduce the number of endoscopies, which are currently carried out via a non-invasive method of diagnosis.This was the procedure they followed: firstly, they confirmed that the same inflammation seen in the intestine of celiac patients could be detected in saliva. The inflammation was then quantified in saliva samples from celiac and control patients. These saliva samples were also tested for the genetic risk of developing celiac disease. With these data on inflammation and genetic risk, a predictive formula was developed. The predictive capacity of this model was subjected to a blind test involving 100 saliva samples, and that resulted in a 73% success rate. In addition, the predictive model displayed a sensitivity of 91%, signifying a 91% success rate among people with celiac disease.Ainara Castellanos, the lead researcher of the study, and Maialen Sebastian, a pre-doctoral student, consider that the method they have developed ""is very useful for screening patients with suspected celiac disease before endoscopy is carried out"". They also recognised that, despite the good results obtained with their prediction model, it is not 100% accurate, which means that the current traditional diagnostic method cannot be totally ruled out. So the authors of this study propose that only those individuals predicted by this model to have celiac disease should undergo an endoscopy, which would considerably reduce the number of endoscopies currently performed.They also showed that the same saliva sample can also be used to test for the genetic risk of the disease, so it could also offer a non-invasive alternative to genetic testing using blood samples, given that the collecting of saliva samples is more convenient than blood collection.Reference: Sebastian-delaCruz M, Olazagoitia-Garmendia A, Huerta Madrigal A, et al.

Faced with new uncertainty, shoppers began stocking up on basic household items   especially toilet paper   to account for the new unknown. This buying frenzy led to shortages, even though, in most cases, there would have been enough to go around if people only purchased what they needed. According to a study led by UNSW Sydney, reactive behaviour like this isn t unusual, but a common way to handle unexpected uncertainty. In fact, unexpected uncertainty is such a powerful motivator for change that it often prompts us to adjust our behaviour   even when it s not good for us. When people experience an unexpected change in their environment, they start looking for ways to lessen that uncertainty,  says lead author of the study Dr Adrian Walker, who completed this research as part of his PhD in psychology at UNSW Science.  They can change their behaviour and decision-making strategies to try and find a way to regain some sense of control. Surprisingly, our study found that unexpected uncertainty caused people to change their behaviours even when they would have been better off sticking to an old strategy.  The behavioural study, recently published in The Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, is the first to show the type of uncertainty we experience   that is, whether it is expected or unexpected   plays a key role in our reaction.For example, a city worker who knows their morning commute takes anywhere from 30 to 50 minutes wouldn t be surprised by a 50-minute trip. On the other hand, a country driver would be very surprised if their predictable 30-minute trip suddenly took 50 minutes.To test how people respond to unexpected change, the researchers tasked study participants with selling a pair of objects to one of two subjects   in this scenario, aliens   in a virtual simulation. Their task was simple: get as many points (or  alien dollars ) as possible.Participants needed to choose which alien to sell a pair of chemicals to, but only one of the chemicals determined how much the alien would pay. They needed to work out which chemical and alien combination would earn them the greatest rewards.An initial group of 35 participants were familiarised with the task and quickly learnt that one strategy (say, Option A) gave the better offer of 15 points. But midway through the experiment, the reward pattern changed, and Option A now gave a random number between 8 and 22 points.  As soon as we added an element of uncertainty, the participants started looking for new ways to complete the task,  says Dr Walker.  The kicker is that in all cases, the best thing they could do was use their old strategy. Dr Walker says the pandemic   and our different responses to it   is a large-scale example of unexpected uncertainty. Everything changed very suddenly at the start of COVID-19,  he says.  Many of us were suddenly all working from home, changing how we shop, and changing how we socialise. The rules we were living by beforehand no longer applied, and there was   and still is   no clear answer about when or how the pandemic will end. Different people tried all sorts of things   like panic shopping   to reduce this new uncertainty and return to  normal . But as we ve seen, not all of these reactive strategies were good in the long run. ","Published: July 30, 2021"

The patent which was filed by an international team of lawyers and researchers led by the University of Surrey's, Professor of Law and Health Sciences, Ryan Abbott  is for a food container based on fractal geometry. This container was designed and created by an AI called DABUS (""device for the autonomous bootstrapping of unified sentience"").Historically, an ""inventor"" of a patent had to be a human being, although the ownership of that patent is commonly given to the company that employs the inventor. While patent law in many jurisdictions is very specific in how it defines an inventor, the DABUS team is arguing that the status quo is not fit for purpose in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.As AI plays an ever-increasing role in the design of ideas, the DABUS case could have significant repercussions on intellectual property law. The DABUS team has similar cases moving through UK, European, US and other court systems.Earlier this year, the president of the European Patent Office, Ant nio Campinos intervened in the European case on the basis that it was  of high importance and general interest. Professor Adrian Hilton, Director of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said:  This is a truly historic case that recognises the need to change how we attribute invention. We are moving from an age in which invention was the preserve of people to an era where machines are capable of realising the inventive step, unleashing the potential of AI-generated inventions for the benefit of society. The School of Law at the University of Surrey has taken a leading role in asking important philosophical questions such as whether innovation can only be a human phenomenon, and what happens legally when AI behaves like a person. We are delighted our staff and students are at the forefront of these deeply significant debates, and now realities. This article has been republished from the following materials.

But a new study co-authored by MIT economists complicates this picture, suggesting that more sleep, by itself, isn t necessarily sufficient to bring about those kinds of appealing improvements.The study is based on a distinctive field experiment of low-income workers in Chennai, India, where the researchers studied residents at home during their normal everyday routines   and managed to increase participants  sleep by about half an hour per night, a very substantial gain. And yet, sleeping more at night did not improve people s work productivity, earnings, financial choices, sense of well-being, or even their blood pressure. The only thing it did, apparently, was to lower the number of hours they worked. To our surprise, these night-sleep interventions had no positive effects whatsoever on any of the outcomes we measured,  says Frank Schilbach, an MIT economist and co-author of a new paper detailing the study s findings.There is more to the matter: For one thing, the researchers found, short daytime naps do help productivity and well-being. For another thing, participants tended to sleep at night in difficult circumstances, with many interruptions. The findings leave open the possibility that helping people sleep more soundly, rather than just adding to their total amount of low-grade sleep, could be useful.  People s sleep quality is so low in these circumstances in Chennai that adding sleep of poor quality may not have the benefits that another half hour of sleep would have if it s of higher quality,  Schilbach suggests.The paper,  The Economic Consequences of Increasing Sleep Among the Urban Poor,  is published in the August issue of The Quarterly Journal of Economics. The authors of the paper are Pedro Bessone PhD  21, a recent graduate from MIT s Department of Economics; Gautam Rao, an associate professor of economics at Harvard University; Schilbach, who is the Gary Loveman Career Development Associate Professor of Economics at MIT; Heather Schofield, an assistant professor in the Perelman School of Medicine and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania; and Mattie Toma, a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard University.","Published: July 30, 2021"

Unexpectedly, the fat loss was not associated with decreased food intake or faster metabolism. Instead, the researchers discovered that TSLP stimulated the immune system to release lipids through the skin s oil-producing sebaceous glands. This was a completely unforeseen finding, but we ve demonstrated that fat loss can be achieved by secreting calories from the skin in the form of energy-rich sebum,  said principal investigator Taku Kambayashi, MD, PhD, an associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Penn, who led the study with fourth-year medical student Ruth Choa, PhD.  We believe that we are the first group to show a non-hormonal way to induce this process, highlighting an unexpected role for the body s immune system. The animal model findings, Kambayashi said, support the possibility that increasing sebum production via the immune system could be a strategy for treating obesity in people.

The nucleic acid looks, for all intents and purposes, like a strand of DNA that has been sliced the long way. It s what s known as single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and it can be found throughout the natural world.Less common in nature is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which has two strands and resembles the well-known DNA double helix. It s found in some viruses, but for the past few decades, people have been developing synthetic dsRNA for a range of purposes.Despite our growing familiarity with its potential applications, researchers knew little about a key feature of dsRNA, namely how dsRNA degrades   a particularly important question as one of its most promising applications is in agriculture as a type of pesticide.Research from the lab of Kimberly Parker, assistant professor of energy, environmental and chemical engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, has upended common assumptions about the chemical stability of dsRNA that may prove useful to fields from agriculture to medicine. The lab s findings even may have implications for our understanding of the origins of life. The results were published this summer in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Fundamentally, we are challenging a pervasive assumption that what we know about ssRNA behavior predicts dsRNA behavior,  Parker said. The general knowledge is that RNA is less stable than DNA,  Parker said. That s because the RNA structure has a few extra atoms that causes the nucleic acid to degrade by itself to smaller pieces.But that s the comparison of ssRNA with DNA. What about the difference between ssRNA and dsRNA?Parker and first author Ke Zhang, a PhD student in Parker s lab, set out to investigate dsRNA degradation. The team found that, even though dsRNA has the same basic structure as ssRNA, it was substantially more chemically stable than ssRNA. Even at extremely harsh alkaline pH conditions that caused ssRNA to degrade in minutes, dsRNA persisted.It s fundamental science, but it also has real consequences.Although little was known about the processes that break down dsRNA, it has been treated as if it behaves the same as ssRNA not only by researchers, but also by institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates pesticide use.Recently, dsRNA has become a hot topic in the world of pesticides. The first crops genetically engineered to contain a dsRNA pesticide might be planted as soon as 2022. When we look at the environmental fate of dsRNA pesticides, a key question is,  Will these things stick around, or are they going to degrade quickly?  Parker said.  If chemical processes acting on dsRNA cause the structure to break down quickly,  it can be considered potentially safe and you don t have to worry about it as much,  Parker said.  But if you need more specific conditions for it to break down, particular enzymes for instance, that changes how you have to think about its safety and potential risk to the environment. You can t rely on chemical instability alone to limit persistence. The researchers also investigated how the surprising chemical stability of dsRNA might be harnessed for good. Although dsRNA is chemically stable, it still can be degraded by enzymes that occur everywhere in the environment   and even our bodies. This can make it difficult to store dsRNA pesticides and products, as well as challenging to measure levels of dsRNA accurately because the dsRNA can degrade after the sample is collected but before it is analyzed.To see if the unique chemical stability of dsRNA could be used to stabilize dsRNA in samples, Zhang looked at how ssRNA and dsRNA degraded in human saliva and soils, each of which has enzymes that work to break down both types of RNA. In each case, both types of RNA were degraded quickly by the enzymes in human saliva and soils,  Zhang said. But when the pH was raised to an alkaline state   which would destroy the enzymes,  things were different; we observed ssRNA was also rapidly degraded by the alkaline conditions. However, dsRNA was actually more stable at the higher pH. The finding suggests that dsRNA   whether used in pesticides, for medical use or research   should be stored in a high pH environment to confer an extra level of protection. Say you work with dsRNA,  Parker said. Maybe you sneeze?  You don t want to worry about contaminating your samples with saliva. You can raise the pH of your samples of dsRNA, shut down the enzyme degradation, but also avoid having the chemical degradation process. The potential to put this knowledge into action goes far beyond pesticides.There are plenty of viruses that carry their genetic information in RNA instead of DNA; some of them use dsRNA.  I m interested in how our work lets us know about how viruses might be killed in different conditions,  she said. Or if viral dsRNA from wastewater could be preserved better at higher pH to help to follow and predict the spread of disease.And there s another area, a little different from the rest, in which a better understanding of dsRNA might be useful: unlocking the mysteries of the origin of life on Earth. It s only conjecture, but it s something that captured Zhang s interest.There is a long-held theory that life on Earth began in hydrothermal vents when smaller molecules came together to form RNA. However, that theory has a fatal flaw: The conditions in these vents would have been alkaline. Some scientists think that can t be possible because RNA would degrade in such conditions,  Zhang said.  But we have found that it s only true for ssRNA. If we consider dsRNA, at alkaline pH, it can maintain its chemical stability. Reference: Zhang K, Hodge J, Chatterjee A, Moon TS, Parker KM.

Among 15 people with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the study who could not be treated previously with surgery, the drugs allowed 12 patients to undergo successful surgical removal of their cancer. Five of these 12 patients had only 10% or less of their tumor remaining after the drug treatment.The combination therapy offers a much-needed treatment for HCC, which makes up more than 90% of all primary liver cancers and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Fewer than 30% of HCC cases globally can be surgically resected at the time of diagnosis, either because the liver is too damaged or the cancer has spread into tissues that make surgery too difficult. The patients who are enrolled in this study are typically just thought of as incurable in the current conventional sense, so the fact that we saw these responses was really exciting, because this suggests this strategy could be adopted for very challenging incurable diseases,  says Won Jin Ho, M.D., assistant professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and first author of the study.HCC is unusual among solid-tumor cancers because there have been no systemic therapies used to treat the cancer to make it more amenable to surgery, says Mark Yarchoan, M.D., assistant professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and senior author.  We had a hunch that there were patients who were currently incurable that we could get to a surgery who would do well, and sure enough, there was a group of patients who participated in this study who are alive today without tumor who would not have been offered surgery before. The findings also suggest that the drug combination could help with rates of cancer recurrence after surgery. Even among patients who have successful surgeries, the rate of recurrence can be 50% or higher. In the current study, the researchers found that the five patients who underwent surgery and had their tumors shrink significantly have remained disease free for more than 230 days so far. Four of the seven patients who did not have a significant tumor response developed disease progression between 56 and 155 days after the end of treatment.Cabozantinib and nivolumab have been used separately and in combination to treat advanced liver cancer before, but the researchers wanted to test their use specifically to see whether they could make more patients eligible for potentially curative surgery. We wanted to use a combination that reflected the standard of care,  says Yarchoan,  and this combination reflected where we feel the field is going in terms of using two drugs together to try to maximize the therapeutic effects. All of the patients were recruited from the Kimmel Cancer Center s Liver and Biliary Cancer Multidisciplinary Clinic, where patients are evaluated by multiple experts in surgery, pathology, medical oncology and other disciplines to come up with a comprehensive treatment plan. The multidisciplinary teamwork is good for patients but is also helpful in this type of study, Yarchoan adds.  At other institutions where you might just see a surgeon, there isn t an opportunity to discuss adding in medicines. The research team took a closer look at the immune response and tumor microenvironment in blood and tissue biopsies from patients enrolled in the study to learn more about exactly how HCC responded   or didn t respond   to the combination treatment. A technique called imaging mass cytometry allowed the clinicians to observe multiple types of cells at once,  and really understand their relationships with one another,  says Ho.For instance, the researchers note that a distinct aggregation of immune B cells was indicative of a response to cabozantinib and nivolumab, supporting a strong antitumor response. The technique also helped the researchers see how the proximity of B cells and T cells to some macrophage immune cells with an immunosuppressive effect was characteristic of tumors that were resistant to the combination treatment.A combination of the kinase-inhibitor drug cabozantinib and the immunotherapy drug nivolumab can make curative surgery possible in some liver cancer patients who would normally not be considered surgery candidates.Reference: Ho WJ, Zhu Q, Durham J, et al.

But it's the portion that lies below the soil   the branching, reaching arms of roots and hairs pulling up water and nutrients   that interests plant physiologist and computer scientist, Alexander Bucksch, associate professor of Plant Biology at the University of Georgia.The health and growth of the root system has deep implications for our future.Our ability to grow enough food to support the population despite a changing climate, and to fix carbon from the atmosphere in the soil are critical to our, and other species', survival. The solutions, Bucksch believes, lie in the qualities of roots.""When there is a problem in the world, humans can move. But what does the plant do?"" he asked. ""It says,  Let's alter our genome to survive.' It evolves.""Until recently, farmers and plant breeders didn't have a good way to gather information about the root system of plants, or make decisions about the optimal seeds to grow deep roots.In a paper published this month in Plant Physiology, Bucksch and colleagues introduce DIRT/3D (Digital Imaging of Root Traits), an image-based 3D root phenotyping platform that can measure 18 architecture traits from mature field-grown maize root crowns excavated using the Shovelomics technique.In their experiments, the system reliably computed all traits, including the distance between whorls and the number, angles, and diameters of nodal roots for 12 contrasting maize genotypes with 84 percent agreement with manual measurements. The research is supported by the ROOTS program of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy (ARPA-E) and a CAREER award from National Science Foundation (NSF).""This technology will make it easier to analyze and understand what roots are doing in real field environments, and therefore will make it easier to breed future crops to meet human needs "" said Jonathan Lynch, Distinguished Professor of Plant Science and co-author, whose research focuses on understanding the basis of plant adaptation to drought and low soil fertility.DIRT/3D uses a motorized camera set-up that takes 2,000 images per root from every perspective. It uses a cluster of 10 Raspberry Pi micro-computers to synchronize the image capture from 10 cameras and then transfers the data to the CyVerse Data Store   the national cyberinfrastructure for academic researchers   for 3D reconstruction.The system generates a 3D point cloud that represents every root node and whorl   ""a digital twin of the root system,"" according to Bucksch, that can be studied, stored, and compared.The data collection takes only a few minutes, which is comparable to an MRI or X-Ray machine. But the rig only costs a few thousand dollars to build, as opposed to half a million, making the technology scalable to perform high-throughput measurements of thousands of specimens, which is needed to develop new crop plants for farmers. Yet, the 3D scanner is also enabling basic science and addresses the problem of pre-selection bias because of sample limitations in plant biology.""Biologists primarily look at the one root structure that is most common   what we call the dominant root phenotype,"" Bucksch explained. ""But people forgot about all of the other phenotypes. They might have a function and a role to fulfill. But we just call it noise,"" Bucksch said. ""Our system will look into that noise in 3D and see what functions these roots might have.""Individuals who use DIRT/3D to image roots will soon be able to upload their data to a service called PlantIT that can perform the same analyses that Bucksch and his collaborators describe in their recent paper, providing information on a wide range of traits from young nodal root length to root system eccentricity. This data lets researchers and breeders compare the root systems of plants from the same or different seeds.The framework is made possible by massive number-crunching capabilities behind the scenes. These are provided by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) which receives massive amounts of data from the CyVerse Cyberinfrastructure for computing.Though it takes only five minutes to image a root crown, the data processing to create the point cloud and quantify the features takes several hours and requires many processors computing in parallel. Bucksch uses the NSF-funded Stampede2 supercomputer at TACC through an allocation from the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) to enable his research and power the public DIRT/2D and DIRT/3D servers.DIRT/3D is an evolution on a previous 2D version of the software that can derive information about roots using only a mobile phone camera. Since it launched in 2016, DIRT/2D has proven to be a useful tool for the field. Hundreds of plant scientists worldwide use it, including researchers at leading agribusinesses.The project is part of ARPA-E's ROOTS program, which is working to develop new technologies that increase carbon storage within the soil and root systems of plants.""The DIRT/3D platform enables researchers to identify novel root traits in crops, and breed plants with deeper, more extensive roots,"" said ARPA-E ROOTS Program Director Dr. David Babson. ""The development of these kind of technologies will help promote climate change mitigation and resilience while also giving farmers the tools to lower costs and increase crop productivity. We're excited to see the progress that the team at PSU and UGA has made over the course of their award.""The tool has led to the discovery of several genes responsible for root traits. Bucksch cites a recent study of Striga hermanthica resistance in sorghum as the kind of outcome he hopes for users of DIRT/3D. Striga, a parasitic weed, regularly destroys sorghum harvests in huge areas of Africa.The lead researcher, Dorota Kawa, a post-doc at UC Davis, found that there are some forms of sorghum with Striga-resistant roots. She derived traits from these roots using DIRT/2D, and then mapped the traits to genes that regulate the release of chemicals in the roots that triggers Striga germination in plants.DIRT3D improves the quality of the root characterizations done with DIRT/2D and captures features that are only accessible when scanned in 3D.The challenges facing farmers are expected to rise in coming years, with more draughts, higher temperatures, low-soil fertility, and the need to grow food in less greenhouse-gas producing ways. Roots that are adapted to these future conditions will help ease pressure on the food supply.""The potential, with DIRT/3D, is helping us live on a hotter planet and managing to have enough food,"" Bucksch said. ""That is always the elephant in the room. There could be a point where this planet can't produce enough food for everybody anymore, and I hope we, as a science community, can avoid this point by developing better drought adapted and CO2 sequestering plants.""Reference: Liu S, Barrow CS, Hanlon M, Lynch JP, Bucksch A.

Because of this function, it is the focus of most COVID-19 vaccines including the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines. The spike protein represents one of the most important therapeutic targets for COVID-19,  said study lead Becky Dutch, vice dean for research in the College of Medicine and chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry.  This study gives scientists a more comprehensive understanding of how the protein works, which is significant to the continued development of vaccines and therapeutics. Dutch s study provides insight into how stable the spike protein is, how it promotes cell-to-cell fusion and how it is modified. Her team examined the effect of mutations in clinical isolates of the virus on protein stability and function. They also observed spike protein synthesis and processing in bat cells to understand if any differences were observed.The study found that the majority of the spike protein degrades within 24 hours, which provides more understanding about the process of infection and vaccination. Since mRNA vaccines work by giving instructions to our cells to make the spike protein, this finding gives insight into how long the newly made protein will be present.Dutch s team also examined the role of key host factors in cell-to-cell fusion. In addition to binding the virus to target cells, the spike protein can cause fusion between the cell it is made in and a neighboring cell, an effect seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.Dutch says there has been relatively little research done on the spike protein s cell-to-cell fusion or stability, so the study will contribute to giving researchers a full picture of how the proteins are made and how they function.Reference: Barrett CT, Neal HE, Edmonds K, et al.

The biological circadian rhythm can be dysregulated by abnormal lifestyle, such as day-night shift work schedules and over-nutrition. Irregular circadian rhythm is closely associated with metabolic disease, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. The Zhang lab identified that circadian rhythm controls energy metabolism through modifying RNAs that encode major metabolic factors. That laid the foundation for this latest research project supported by the NIH. Irregular circadian rhythm is one of major causes of human metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer,  Dr. Zhang said.  Due to the modern lifestyle, the problem of irregular circadian rhythm is not only related to shift workers, but also to the public at large in developed counties. Shift workers -- for example nurses -- have higher risk of metabolic syndrome and breast cancer. Dr. Zhang will work with Deyu Fang, Ph.D., M.D., professor of Pathology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who is the multiple-principle investigator on the project. Our research discovered a new circadian-regulated pathway that controls lipid levels through modifying RNAs that encode major metabolic enzymes in the liver. We will identify the stress-induced regulators of this new pathway and the therapeutic potential by targeting this pathway,  Dr. Zhang said.  Our work will not only contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis governing energy metabolism, but also shed new light on developing therapeutics for lipid-associated metabolic disease.

Quantum materials hold great promise for improving the capacities of today s computers,  explains Andrew Kent, a New York University physicist and one of the senior investigators.  The work draws upon their properties in establishing a new structure for computation. The creation, designed in partnership with researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) and the University of Paris-Saclay, is reported in the Nature journal Scientific Reports.  Since conventional computing has reached its limits, new computational methods and devices are being developed,  adds Ivan Schuller, a UC San Diego physicist and one of the paper s authors.  These have the potential of revolutionizing computing and in ways that may one day rival the human brain. In recent years, scientists have sought to make advances in what is known as  neuromorphic computing --a process that seeks to mimic the functionality of the human brain. Because of its human-like characteristics, it may offer more efficient and innovative ways to process data using approaches not achievable using existing computational methods. In the Scientific Reports work, the researchers created a new device that marks major progress already made in this area.To do so, they built a nanoconstriction spintronic resonator to manipulate known physical properties in innovative ways. A schematic of a nanoconstriction spintronic resonator (a), which depicts signal (S) and ground (G) electrical contacts, along with the current flow (b), measured at 200 nanometers. Image courtesy of NYU s Department of PhysicsResonators are capable of generating and storing waves of well-defined frequencies--akin to the box of a string instrument. Here, the scientists constructed a new type of resonator--capable of storing and processing information similar to synapses and neurons in the brain. The one described in Scientific Reports combines the unique properties of quantum materials together with that of spintronic magnetic devices.Spintronic devices are electronics that use an electron s spin in addition to its electrical charge to process information in ways that reduce energy while increasing storage and processing capacity relative to more traditional approaches. A broadly used such device, a  spin torque oscillator,  operates at a specific frequency. Combining it with a quantum material allows tuning this frequency and thus broadening its applicability considerably.  This is a fundamental advance that has applications in computing, particularly in neuromorphic computing, where such resonators can serve as connections among computing components,  observes Kent.

Pinning proteins to its genetic material at the height of inflammation, the cells bookmark where they left off in their last tussle. Next exposure, inflammatory memory kicks in. The cells draw from prior experience to respond more efficiently, even to threats that they have not encountered before. Skin heals a wound faster if it was previously exposed to an irritant, such as a toxin or pathogen; immune cells can attack new viruses after a vaccine has taught them to recognize just one virus. Now, a new study in Cell Stem Cell describes the mechanism behind inflammatory memory, also commonly referred to as trained immunity, and suggests that the phenomenon may be universal across diverse cell types.   This is happening in natural killer cells, T cells, dendritic cells from human skin, and epidermal stem cells in mice,  says Samantha B. Larsen, a former graduate student in the laboratory of Elaine Fuchs at The Rockefeller University.  The similarities in mechanism are striking, and may explain the remitting and relapsing nature of chronic inflammatory disorders in humans.  ","Published: July 30, 2021"

The fish living in icy conditions might remain still enough to study its scales, but to understand how the fish swims and behaves, it needs to freely move in three dimensions. The same holds true for analyzing how biological items, such as viruses, move in the human body, according to a research team led by Deb Kelly, Huck Chair in Molecular Biophysics and professor of biomedical engineering at Penn State, who has used advanced electron microscopy (EM) technology to see how human viruses move in high resolution in a near-native environment. The visualization technique could lead to improved understanding of how vaccine candidates and treatments behave and function as they interact with target cells, Kelly said. In an effort to expand the tools scientists have to study the microscopic world, researchers recorded live, 20-second-long movies of human viruses floating in liquid at near-atomic detail in an electron microscope. The same degree of information, immediately available as they record, may take up to 24 hours to acquire using traditional static imaging methods. Their approach and results were made available online July 24 in Advanced Materials.   The challenge remained to view biological materials in dynamic systems that reflects their authentic performance in the body,  said Kelly, who also directs the Penn State Center for Structural Oncology.  Our results show new structures and active insights of human viruses contained in minute volumes of liquid   the same size as respiratory droplets that spread SARS-CoV-2. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is becoming the field s gold standard for observing samples at or beyond atomic resolution, according to Kelly. The technique involves flash freezing the sample and focusing a beam of electrons through it. The electrons and the sample s components interact, which is captured by detectors embedded in the instrument. Thousands of images can be processed to calculate what the item looks like in 3D   but more is needed to fully understand how the item functions in a more natural setting. While cryo-EM can tell us a lot of information, it still produces a static image,  said GM Jonaid, the paper s first author and a student in the Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program in the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences. Jonaid is conducting his doctoral dissertation research in Kelly s lab.  With improved chips and a powerful direct detector on the microscope, we can accumulate a lot of movie frames to view how the sample acts in real time. We can see things how they exist   not just how we prepared them. The researchers used adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a model system to demonstrate their approach. AAV is a biological nanoparticle that can be used to help deliver vaccines or treatments directly to cells. The platform is based on a hijacked adenovirus, which can easily enter several kinds of cells. The ease with which it interacts with cells makes it a useful capsule to transport its engineered payload. AAV is a well-known, gene therapy vehicle with current applications involved in drug delivery and vaccine development for COVID-19,  Kelly said.  This model system is already well-studied so we can use it to validate our approach with the goal of seeing biological entitles in a liquid state, as maintained in the human body. The researchers applied minute volumes of liquid solution containing AAV to the wells of specialized silicon nitride microchips, commercially supplied by Protochips Inc. They then placed the microchip assemblies in the EM to examine the viruses in action. The images are very comparable to cryo-EM data, but the preparation was less complex, less technically involved,  Jonaid said.  Once we had the images, taken rapidly, like frames of a movie, we processed them just like we would any other high-resolution data. The results were videos of AAV moving in liquid, with subtle changes in the particle s surface, suggesting that the particle s physical properties change as it explores its environment, Kelly said. The resolution was close to three to four Angstroms (a single atom is measured as one Angstrom).Once they proved the imaging strategies worked, the researchers set their sights on a smaller target: antibodies produced by COVID-19 patients. We saw how antibodies contained in the serum of COVID-19 patients interacted with the remaining SARS-CoV-2 particles,  Kelly said, noting that the ability to observe such interactions would be especially useful when assessing the viability of vaccine candidates prior to clinical trials.Kelly and her team plan to continue investigating the molecular underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 and host-receptor proteins using liquid phase-EM, as a complement to the information garnered from cryo-EM results. You really need data from both techniques to understand how viruses look and behave in the living body,  Kelly said.  Visualizing the dynamic movement in solution complements high-resolution snapshots to reveal more complete information. Reference: Jonaid GM, Dearnaley WJ, Casasanta MA, et al.

The results also may help climate scientists make better predictions for how global warming will affect weather patterns, ecosystems, and storm impacts throughout the Pacific rim. Understanding how the tropics are changing due to global warming is an important task for scientists to tackle because this region is a key driver of weather and climate events around the globe,  said first author Ulla Heede, a graduate student in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Yale.The study s senior author is Yale climate scientist Alexey Fedorov, a professor of ocean and atmospheric sciences in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Fedorov s work investigates global weather systems and phenomena such as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, one of the planet s largest water circulation systems, and El Ni o events.In the new study, Heede and Fedorov focus on the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, a region characterized by cold water that rises to the surface, driven by surface winds known as trade winds. Periodic relaxing of these winds causes El Ni o, the warm phase of the El Ni o Southern Oscillation, featuring unusually warm water in the Pacific.If the eastern Pacific warms at a faster rate than surrounding oceans, it signals a slowing of atmospheric tropical circulation known as the Walker circulation   which manifests in a reduction of both the trade winds and the amount of cold water rising from the ocean depths. A slowdown of tropical circulation would mean changes to the El Ni o events and the tropical rain belt,  Fedorov said.  These changes would affect societies across the tropics and beyond. But that slowdown hasn t occurred yet, despite numerous climate model projections. In fact, the region has warmed less than surrounding areas or even cooled in recent decades, while the tropical atmospheric circulation strengthened. This prompts the question: Is this just natural climate variability or are other factors to blame?According to the new Yale study, it was atmospheric aerosols, minute particles that are emitted by multiple sources, including human activities. It is known that aerosols arising from air pollution and combustion have a cooling effect on the Earth s climate, and that aerosols have partially cancelled out some warming effects from greenhouse gases since pre-industrial time,  Heede said.  We show in our study that aerosols are likely contributing to the delay in eastern Equatorial warming and the slowdown of tropical circulation, which would have otherwise occurred. Heede added,  It is important to keep in mind that this delay is temporary. In the future, as greenhouse gas emissions increase further, they will become the dominant factor for tropical Pacific climate, likely leading to enhanced eastern Pacific warming. It is likely that the delay in eastern Equatorial warming will continue for several decades, the researchers said.Heede and Fedorov said there may also be a thermostat-like mechanism operating in the tropical Pacific that is contributing to the delay in warming. Cold water upwells in the eastern equatorial Pacific due to the trade winds. With global warming, the deeper ocean warms slower than the surface waters, and this contributes to a delay in warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific, while temperature in the western equatorial Pacific keeps rising. These two factors strengthen the trade winds   as these winds critically depend on the east-west ocean temperature contrast   and maintain the upwelling of relatively cooler waters until the deeper ocean warms enough to overcome this effect.For the study, the researchers worked with datasets from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), a long-term, international climate research program, using a compilation of 40 different climate models. The researchers conducted climate simulations of historical periods from the past and also projected future climate scenarios.Reference: Heede UK, Fedorov AV.

Now, biologists at Washington University in St. Louis are using comparative metabologenomics to try to uncover what may be  silencing  Streptomyces and preventing it from producing desirable compounds encoded by its genes. We examined genetic differences across the genomes of Streptomyces while at the same time looking at antibiotic outputs,  said Joshua Blodgett, assistant professor of biology in Arts & Sciences, the corresponding author of research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).  This study highlights comparative metabologenomics as a powerful approach to expose the features that differentiate strong antibiotic producers from weaker ones. Blodgett s team, including recent PhD graduate Yunci Qi and postdoctoral research associate Keshav Nepal, compared a group of antibiotic-producing strains of Streptomyces and other nonproducing or poor-producing strains to reveal genomic differences that could affect drug production.The researchers found a few key differences between the strains. Notably, the good producers of polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PTM) antibiotics seemed to benefit from griseorhodin production, which the researchers did not anticipate and originally had tried to eliminate.But a handful of nucleotides matter, too. Metabologenomics revealed that the presence or absence of two to three nucleotides   essentially letters that make up a genetic message  can tune the switches that drive PTM antibiotic production. This type of fine control previously had been found in certain bacteria that cause disease, but largely had been overlooked in bacteria that produce drugs. Our work highlights the problem of silent gene clusters and the need to understand them for next-generation drug discovery,  Blodgett said.  Comparative metabologenomics is a generally adoptable strategy, and we hope that others might use it to examine their own strains and drug pathways. Reference: Qi Y, Nepal KK, Blodgett JAV.

Specifically, they identified a gene in the bacterium that suppresses immune defenses in infected human cells, which could exacerbate the infection.This new finding may point to an effective target for a gene-based treatment or preventative therapy for tuberculosis, which sickens about 10 million people and kills 1-2 million people annually according to the World Health Organization. Available treatments are only 85% effective and multidrug-resistant forms of tuberculosis pose a public health threat in many parts of the world. The study was published on July 29, 2021, in the journal PLOS Pathogens. In order to develop novel therapeutic targets, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of how bacterial proteins interact with human cells is essential,  said Volker Briken, a professor of cell biology and molecular genetics at UMD and the senior author of the study.  This is exciting that we have discovered an interaction that has never been observed before between the bacteria that causes tuberculosis and a signaling system in human cells that is important in the cell s defense against pathogens. Briken and his team, which was led by postdoctoral fellow and lead author of the study Shivangi Rastogi, made their discovery by infecting a type of white blood cell called a macrophage with either Mtb the bacterium that causes tuberculosis or a non-virulent bacterium and observing the cell s response. The researchers found that a complex of proteins called the inflammasome was dramatically limited in cells infected with Mtb, but not in those infected with the non-virulent bacteria. The inflammasome surveys a cell s interior for pathogens and then signals the cell to launch an immune response. It was very unexpected for us to find this primary observation that Mtb can actually inhibit the inflammasome,  Briken said.  The infection also causes some minor activation of the inflammasome, and so no one bothered to look for a potential of Mtb to inhibit the process. It is a classic example of the tug of war between the pathogen wanting to suppress host immunity and the host cell sensing the pathogen to activate immune responses. Next, the team wanted to know if a specific Mtb gene was responsible for suppressing the inflammasome. The researchers inserted genes of Mtb into a non-virulent mycobacterium species and used these mutants to infect new macrophages. They discovered that infections with non-virulent bacteria carrying the Mtb gene named PknF limited the inflammasome response in host cells. We don't know how this gene inhibits the inflammasome,  Briken said,  but the function of this gene is to regulate the production and/or secretions of lipids, so we think maybe the bacterium modifies lipid secretion in a way that influences the inflammasome. That is what we will be investigating in future studies. How PknF suppresses the inflammasome of host cells is just one of the questions Briken would like to answer. He and his team are also working to determine PknF s role in the virulence of the disease. If it turns out that suppressing the inflammasome allows Mtb to be more virulent, then the PknF gene could become a good target for future drug therapies to treat the disease.Reference: Rastogi S, Ellinwood S, Augenstreich J, Mayer-Barber KD, Briken V.

Ubiquitin was previously known to control numerous processes, such as signal transduction and metabolism. Prof. Dr. David Vilchez and his colleagues at the CECAD Cluster of Excellence for Aging Research at the University of Cologne performed a comprehensive quantitative analysis of ubiquitin signatures during aging in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm which is broadly used for aging research. This method - called ubiquitin proteomics - measures all changes in ubiquitination of proteins in the cell. The resulting data provide site-specific information and define quantitative changes in ubiquitin changes across all proteins in a cell during aging. A comparison with the total protein content of a cell (proteome) showed which changes have functional consequences in protein turnover and actual protein content during aging. The scientists thus discovered new regulators of lifespan and provide a comprehensive data set that helps to understand aging and longevity. The article, 'Rewiring of the ubiquitinated proteome determines aging in C. elegans,' has now been published in Nature.""Our study of ubiquitin changes led us to a number of exciting conclusions with important insights for understanding the aging process,"" said Dr Seda Koyuncu, lead author of the study. ""We discovered that aging leads to changes in the ubiquitination of thousands of proteins in the cell, whereas longevity measures such as reduced food intake and reduced insulin signaling prevent these changes.  Specifically, the researchers found that aging causes a general loss of ubiquitination. This is caused by the enzymes that remove ubiquitin from proteins become more active during aging. Normally, ubiquitinated proteins are recognized and destroyed by the proteasome, the cell's garbage truck. The scientists showed that the longevity of organisms is determined by age-related changes in the degradation of structural and regulatory proteins by the proteasome. ""We studied animals with a defective proteasome to identify proteins that become less ubiquitinated with age and thus are not cleaned up by the proteasome and accumulate in the cell. The resulting protein accumulation leads to cell death,"" Koyuncu says. ""Remarkably, we saw that reducing the protein levels of these untagged proteins was sufficient to prolong longevity, while preventing their degradation by the proteasome shortened lifespan.""In addition to providing a comprehensive data set, the investigators showed that defining changes in the ubiquitin-modified proteome can lead to the discovery of new regulators of lifespan and aging traits. They focused their follow-up analyses on two specific proteins that lacked ubiquitin labeling during aging. IFB-2, a protein important for cell structure, and EPS-8, a modulator of a signaling pathway that regulates a variety of cellular processes. These proteins, which are no longer adequately labeled in aged organisms, affect longevity in a variety of tissues. Increased protein levels of IFB-2, for example, cause the intestine to fail to digest properly or absorb nutrients and also make it more susceptible to bacterial infections, which is a characteristic of aging animals. ""Remarkably, knockdown of IFB-2 in adult C. elegans was enough to restore normal gut function,"" Koyuncu says. Too much amounts of EPS-8 in cells over activate a specific signaling pathway (RAC) in muscle and brain cells. The team discovered here that the RAC signaling pathway determines longevity, muscle integrity and motility.""Our findings may point to new ways to delay the aging process and improve quality of life in old age. In particular, we have established a novel link between aging and general changes in the ubiquitin-modified proteome, a process that actively influences longevity,"" said study coordinator David Vilchez, research group leader at CECAD and the Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC).

The highest risk groups within the study were young adults and bone marrow transplant recipients, providing information to clinicians that wasn t readily available before and will be useful in preventing future infection in cancer patients. Our findings really emphasize the need to increase immunity at the community level, particularly among health care workers or caregivers who have frequent contact with cancer patients, in order to protect this vulnerable population,  said Elizabeth Krantz, biostatistician at Fred Hutch and co-senior author of the study.Krantz and the study team analyzed antibody results from 959 patients at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and found that 25% of study participants didn t have adequate protective antibodies against measles virus and 38% didn t have adequate antibodies against mumps virus. In addition, the study also found that levels of antibodies against those viruses varied significantly by age, cancer type and treatments.Although childhood immunizations have been responsible for limiting outbreaks of measles and mumps, COVID-19 is slowing progress of that public health achievement. Compared to SARS-CoV-2, measles is far more contagious, and should an outbreak occur it would pose a serious threat to cancer patients. In recent years, childhood vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella have been dipping in parts of the country, even as new treatments are helping many cancer patients survive. People have stopped going to doctor s appointments, and we ve stopped sending people out into the field to vaccinate children. My worry is that measles outbreaks are going to happen throughout the world because we have not addressed this, or put resources into it,  pointed out Dr. Steve Pergam, infectious disease specialist at Fred Hutch, medical director of infection prevention at SCCA and study co-senior author.  Mumps and measles outbreaks are potentially something that will be in our future if we don t catch up with vaccines. Drilling down deeper into the data, the study team found nuances that will give clinicians perspective on the findings. They hypothesized that the lower rates of antibody protection among young people in the study could have been driven by the kinds of cancers young people are more likely to have, such as hematologic malignancies. Because solid tumor cancers are more prevalent in older people, the younger patients in the study were more likely to have hematologic malignancies,  noted Krantz.  A careful analysis of the data suggested that both age and type of cancer are likely important factors in measles and mumps immunity. Reference: Marquis SR, Logue JK, Chu HY, et al.

Neurons are loaded with special light-sensitive proteins called opsins that sense light (in the visible range), convert it into electric signals, and activate neurons. Conventionally, optical fibers connected to a light source are invasively implanted into the target tissue. But reaching the deep areas of the brain using this technique is usually accompanied by extensive tissue damage, light toxicity, and harmful effects of thermal irradiation. To reduce this damage, scientists use microparticles that emit visible light in response to near-infrared irradiation (NIR). These particles are injected into the target tissue and neuron activation is achieved without tissue damage. However, NIR has its limitations it can only penetrate some millimeters of tissue.Now, researchers from Japan have finally overcome this challenge by using X-rays to penetrate deep regions of the brain. The findings of this multidisciplinary study, all set to be published in Nature Communications, was led by neuroscientists Prof. Takayuki Yamashita and Dr. Takanori Matsubara from the Department of Physiology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, and material scientist Dr. Takayuki Yanagida from Nara Institute of Science and Technology. Prof. Yamashita explains the use of X-rays in their study:  This new technology enables remote control of brain functions in living animals without damaging radio-sensitive cells in the body. X-rays are widely used for imaging the human body because of their penetrative capacity. Using this ability of the X-rays, the researchers could reach the deeper areas of the brain. However, opsins do not respond to X-rays. So, to convert the radiation into visible light, the researchers chose materials called scintillators. Prof. Yamashita explains,  Scintillators, which emit visible light when irradiated with X-rays, have widely been used in X-ray inspection machines and CT scans, but their applications in biology have been limited. This work is the first application of scintillators to behavioral neuroscience. The researchers crushed yellow-emitting inorganic scintillator crystals synthesized in the lab and injected the microparticles into mice brain cells. When X-rays were irradiated onto a dissected mouse head, they passed through skin, skull, and brain tissue. In response to the X-rays, the microparticles emitted yellow light which activated the opsins for excitation and inhibition of neurons. The researchers were able to confirm these results in live mice.To explore further, the researchers also tested whether the control of neural function by X-rays and opsins could induce a change in behavior. For this, they performed a conditioned place preference test in which mice were given a choice between two compartments, one out of which was exposed to X-ray radiation. The mice either had excitatory opsins or inhibitory opsins in neurons that govern this type of behavior. Before X-ray irradiation, no mice showed any preference for a compartment. However, after X-ray irradiation, mice with excitatory opsins had an increased preference for the X-ray irradiated compartment and mice with inhibitory opsins showed the opposite behavior.These results show the advantages of X-rays over conventional methods of optogenetics. Prof. Yamashita is excited by the achievement of the team,  There are many biomedical technologies that use light to control protein functions. However, these technologies have not been easy to apply to deep tissues owing to the low penetration of stimulating light into the tissue. In contrast, our technology is almost unconstrained by the depth of the tissue.  It also helps that scintillators are bio-compatible, do not cause any tissue damage, and are non-toxic even for long-term implantation.Scintillator-based optogenetics has many potential applications, from modulating neurons for research to treatment of neurological disorders. The non-invasive nature of this technique allows experiments to be conducted without wires and plugs, not hindering observation and science. The world of neuroexploration thus seems to have found a new and wonderful probing technique!Reference: Matsubara T, Yanagida T, Kawaguchi N, et al.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/protein-discovery-links-together-two-forms-of-als-351430,Protein Discovery Links Together Two Forms of ALS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS  is a rapidly progressive and fatal degenerative disease affecting the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement  Researchers have found a possible starting point for the dysfunction that causes the disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal degenerative disease affecting the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement.  Sporadic  or non-inherited ALS, accounts for roughly 90% percent of cases, and 10% of cases are due to known genetic mutations.  By studying lab-grown neurons derived from skin or blood cells from 10 normal controls, eight with an ALS causing mutation, and 17 with non-inherited ALS, researchers have found a possible starting point for the dysfunction that causes the disease. The study, which was published in Science Translational Medicine was funded in part by the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.Using a library of ALS patient-derived cells, the research team led by Jeffrey Rothstein, M.D., Ph.D., at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, developed induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from the patients  cultured cells to discover a common defect regardless of whether the cell came from persons with inherited or non-inherited ALS. They report that in ALS nerve cells, there is an accumulation of a protein called CHMP7 in the nucleus of cultured nerve cells as well as in ALS samples from the brain region that controls movement. Treatments that decrease the amount of CHMP7 in the cultured cells prevented a series of abnormalities that are characteristic of ALS. There is considerable interest in identifying new therapeutic targets for ALS, particularly for the sporadic form of the disorder,  said Amelie Gubitz, Ph.D., program director, NINDS.  Gene-targeting strategies like the one shown here now allow us to move from biological discovery straight to therapy development. This study builds on an earlier paper by the Rothstein lab that looked at the most common genetic cause of ALS, a mutation in the C9orf72 gene (also referred to as the  C9 mutation ). There, they showed that the C9 mutation produced defects in a structure called the nuclear pore that is responsible for moving proteins and other molecules in and out of the nucleus of cells. Specifically, they found that certain proteins were absent from the pore, causing a domino-like effect in which the entire pore breaks apart. We knew from our previous work that the C9 mutation was producing defects in the nuclear pore, but we didn t know why,  said Dr. Rothstein.  Here, we set out to answer the question of what was happening upstream of the pore defects by studying neurons derived from the cells of patients with ALS. Specifically, the researchers looked at nerve cells grown from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are a type of stem cell that can be created from samples of a person s skin or blood. These cells behave very much like other stem cells in that they can be turned into many different cell types in a lab setting, including nerve cells. By working with Answer ALS, a national ALS biological data and iPSC effort run by Rothstein, the researchers were able to access iPSCs derived from both familial and sporadic ALS patients. One of the great advantages of iPSCs is that you can look at different times very much in the same way as you would study animal models at different ages,  said Dr. Rothstein.  We knew the time point where the nuclear pores began to degrade, and we were able to study neurons at earlier times to see what the cause could be. What they found was that the accumulation of CHMP7 within the nucleus occurred at least one week prior to the development of nuclear pore abnormalities. Normally, CHMP7 is quickly removed once it enters the nucleus, but in both C9 and sporadic ALS iPSC-derived neurons, the accumulation persisted. If an antisense oligonucleotide drug, which stops cells from manufacturing specific proteins, was used to decrease the amount of CHMP7 within the ALS neurons, the pore never degraded. Finally, if a mutated form of CHMP7 that cannot be removed from the nucleus was added to healthy neurons, the pore degraded much like what was seen in ALS neurons, suggesting that the presence of CHMP7 within the nuclei of neurons could be a lynchpin event in the development of the disease.One abnormality common to all forms of ALS is the mislocalization of another protein, TDP-43. Normally found in the nucleus, TDP-43 leaks out into the surrounding cytoplasm in ALS where it clumps together into aggregates, leading to loss of function changes in various types of RNA, which are critical for the translation of certain genes into proteins. Eventually this is also seen in iPSC-derived neurons from both C9 and sporadic ALS patients. Following treatment with the antisense oligonucleotides for CHMP7, the TDP-43 mislocalization was no longer seen and the RNA defects were all corrected. These findings together allow us to put these abnormalities in sequence, where CHMP7 accumulation in the nucleus leads to nuclear pore injury, followed by TDP-43 mislocalization, and ultimately cell death,  said Dr. Rothstein.  This is not just limited to the C9 mutation; it is a fundamental pathway in sporadic ALS as well that can be treated with antisense oligonucleotides for CHMP7. Dr. Rothstein s lab is currently investigating whether the antisense oligonucleotide drug could be developed into a treatment for both C9 and sporadic ALS patients. They are also continuing to study the initial accumulation of CHMP7 to determine what causes the mislocalization in the nucleus.Reference: Coyne AN, Baskerville V, Zaepfel BL, et al.

The system is based on alternative RNA splicing using an orally available small molecule and works effectively in tissues throughout the body, including the brain. The first research regarding this innovation was published today in the journal Nature. We re taking the field of gene therapy to an entirely new level where fine-tuned dosing is required for safety, utility and success,  said senior study author Beverly L. Davidson, PhD, Director of the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics and Chief Scientific Strategy Officer at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia.  This study shows that by using a splicing modulator in combination with gene therapy tools, the dose of protein expressed from gene therapy vectors can be controlled for maximum therapeutic benefit. Many advancements in gene therapy have involved its delivery system, in the form of engineered viral vectors or lipid nanoparticles, but while improvements in these vehicles have delivered treatments to tissues more effectively, the cargo being delivered and elements controlling the resulting gene expression have not received the same amount of attention. Once gene therapy has been successfully delivered into the tissue, it is difficult to regulate the levels of expression. Too much expression may have toxic effects on the patient, and too little expression may mean that the patient does not receive the intended benefits of the therapy.To address this problem, CHOP researchers developed a delivery system called the Xon system, which can finely control protein translation by using a  dimmer switch  to adjust the levels of expression up or down as needed. This method employs alternative RNA splicing, a process that allows a single gene to code for multiple proteins, depending on how the RNA is spliced. Using the Xon system, a gene therapy vector s cargo is inactive until the oral drug is used, which then drives the splicing of the desired corrective gene into its active form. The newly developed switch not only controls protein levels, but if needed, those proteins can be induced again and again by the simple ingestion of an orally bioavailable drug,  said Alex Mas Monteys, PhD, a research assistant professor in Davidson s lab at CHOP and co-lead author of the study.In one example reported in this paper, the researchers used the Xon system in mice to adjust levels of erythropoietin (Epo), which is used to treat anemia associated with kidney disease. The researchers found that their delivery system induced hematocrit levels to 60 to 70% above baseline levels depending on the dose, and once levels slowly dropped to base levels, the system could be used again to safely re-induce the levels as would be needed for patients with chronic kidney disease. The research was conducted as part of a multi-year collaboration with scientists at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR). CHOP and NIBR are collaborating to develop next-generation small molecule splicing modulators and the Xon system to achieve fine-tuned gene regulation across multiple clinical applications. The team has also shown that the Xon system can be used to control expression of gene products that are toxic to the brain when expressed at high levels. The dose of a drug can determine how high you want expression to be, and then the system can automatically  dim down  at a rate related to the half-life of the protein,  Davidson said.  We can envision scenarios where a drug would be given only once, such as for controlling the expression of foreign proteins needed for gene editing, or with limited frequency. Since the splicing modulators we have tested are given orally, compliance to control protein expression from viral vectors employing Xon-based cassettes should be high. Although the paper focuses on using Xon with gene therapy delivered via viral vectors, the researchers note it could also be engineered for use in cell engineering for CAR-T cell therapy. Here, the Xon system could be used to pause therapy if needed to give T-cells a rest.Reference: Monteys AM, Hundley AA, Ranum PT, et al. Regulated control of gene therapies by drug-induced splicing.

The new findings, published online in Nature Communications, could help doctors understand which men are at the highest risk of developing the disease and signal them to screen those patients.The multi-institutional meta-analysis was conducted by researchers from The international TEsticular CAncer Consortium (TECAC), led by Katherine L. Nathanson, MD, deputy director of Penn's Abramson Cancer Center and Pearl Basser Professor of BRCA-Related Research in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.In 2017, the TECAC reported an additional 12 loci. The new study brings the total number to 78. This latest set of genetic locations is adding to our understanding of the inherited drivers of testicular cancer, as we look to improve screening among men who may be at high risk,  Nathanson said.  Although this cancer is curable, identifying these men earlier can help save them from having to undergo certain treatments, such as chemotherapy, which can have late and unwanted complications. Germ cell tumors account for 95 percent of testicular cancer cases. TGCTs are the most common cancer in the United States and Europe in white men between the ages of 20 and 39. The number of cases has continued to rise over the past 25 years in white men and more recently in Latino men. Despite significant evidence that susceptibility to these tumors is hereditary, CHEK2 is the only moderate penetrance gene in which pathogenic variants have been associated with risk of the cancer.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been more successful, identifying common variations associated with risk of the disease. Nathanson and TECAC teams have used the method to find locations on chromosomes   called loci   that contain variants associated with an increased risk of germ cell tumors.In the latest study, TECAC researchers analyzed genetic data from 10,156 testicular germ cell tumor cases and 179,683 controls in the largest GWAS of TGCT to date.The study revealed 22 novel loci. When taken together, the results can explain 44 percent of the father-to-son familial risk for testicular cancer, the authors said. Men with a high polygenic risk score (in the 95th percentile) also had a 6.8-fold increased disease risk compared to men at the median score.Beyond the statistical significance of the new loci, the study also demonstrated two relevant biological pathways tied to disease susceptibility, male germ cell development and chromosomal segregation during cell division. When these pathways go awry, they lead to TGCT tumorigenesis. Results from our investigation provide further understanding of the genetic architecture of TGCT, enhance comprehension of the biology of male germ cell development, and highlight biological pathways specifically important to TGCT,  the authors wrote.  Importantly, we have established a polygenic risk score that identifies men at highest risk of disease, which could be potentially applied in men with other risk factors, such as [undescended testes] or infertility, to be targeted for early detection and disease mitigation. Next, researchers will begin to further investigate the increase in TGCT cases observed among Latino men and if the genetic variants observed in mostly white men also exist in that population.Reference: Pluta J, Pyle LC, Nead KT, et al.

Atopic dermatitis and pain hypersensitivity are both conditions associated with some types of ASD.The gene in question, contactin associated protein 2 (CNTNAP2), is thought to be linked to a mutation associated with some forms of autism. This gene is found throughout the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which are clusters of sensory cells located at the root of the spinal nerves. The DRG is the superhighway that transmits sensations of both pain and itch from the skin through the spinal cord to the brain. Since atopic dermatitis is often associated with ASD and CNTNAP2 is both linked to pain hypersensitivity in ASD and expressed in almost all DRG sensory neurons, we wondered whether CNTNAP2 might also contribute to itch behavior,  says Santosh Mishra, assistant professor of neuroscience at NC State and author of the study.Mishra compared itch response in mice with the CNTNAP2 gene to those without it. In the presence of both histamine and non-histamine based stimuli, the CNTNAP2 knock-out mice, or mice without the gene, had a reduced itch response compared to mice with the gene. If there is a link between ASD and atopic dermatitis, then mice without a normal CNTNAP2 gene would be expected to have an increased itch response just as they have increased sensitivity to pain,  Mishra says.  There are several possible explanations for this finding, ranging from standard physiological differences between humans and animals to CNTNAP2 s potential role in releasing neuropeptides that could affect this response. But we also know that pain can suppress itch sensation and vice versa. Just as some humans with ASD have higher pain sensitivity, so do mice without CNTNAP2. That pain sensitivity may be inhibiting the itch sensation. Mishra hopes that this pilot study may pave the way to further exploration of the role of CNTNAP2 in itch. The functional role of CNTNAP2 in the neural transmission of itch is unknown,  Mishra says.  While this study sheds light on the possible linkage between ASD and itch, it s limited because it is primarily based on behavioral, not cellular or molecular, results. Future studies may be required to dissect the molecular underpinnings of CNTNAP2 and itch sensation.""Reference: Mishra SK. The Role of CNTNAP2 in Itch Sensation.

More leads to floods, less to drought. It has been realized decades earlier that global warming drives increased rainfall on average. How this increase is delivered in time matters enormously. A 2-3% increase of annual precipitation uniformly spreading out of the year does not mean much, but if it falls out in a week or a day, it will cause havoc. Using large ensembles of state-of-the-art climate model simulations, this study highlights the increase in rainfall variability across a range of time scales from daily to multiyear. Scientists have found that in a future warming world, climatologically wet regions (including the tropics, monsoon regions and mid- to high-latitudes) will not only get wetter on average, but also swing widely between wet and dry conditions.Classification of precipitation change regimes based on changes in the precipitation mean state and variability. Shading indicates the ratio of change in precipitation variability and mean precipitation. (Image by IAP)""As climate warms, climatologically wet regions will generally get wetter and dry regions get drier. Such a global pattern of mean rainfall change is often described as 'wet-get-wetter'. By analogy, the global pattern of rainfall variability change features a 'wet-get-more variable' paradigm. Moreover, the global mean increase in rainfall variability is more than twice as fast as the increase in mean rainfall in a percentage sense,"" said ZHOU Tianjun, corresponding author of the study. ZHOU is a senior scientist at IAP. He is also a professor at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.The enhanced rainfall variability, to a first order, is due to increased water vapor in the air as climate warms; but is partly offset by the weakening circulation variability. The latter dominates regional patterns of change in rainfall variability.By considering changes in both the mean state and variability of precipitation, the research provides a new perspective for interpreting future precipitation change regimes. ""Around two-thirds of land will face a 'wetter and more variable' hydroclimate, while the remaining land regions are projected to become 'drier but more variable' or 'drier and less variable'. This classification of different precipitation change regimes is valuable for regional adaptation planning,"" said ZHANG Wenxia, lead author of the study.""The globally amplified rainfall variability manifests the fact that global warming is making our climate more uneven more extreme in both wet and dry conditions, with wider and probably more rapid transitions between them,"" said Kalli FURTADO, Expert Scientist at the Met Office and second author of the study. ""The more variable rainfall events could further translate into impacts on crop yields and river flows, challenging the existing climate resilience of infrastructures, human society and ecosystems. This makes climate change adaptation more difficult.""Reference: Zhang W, Furtado K, Wu P, et al. Increasing precipitation variability on daily-to-multiyear time scales in a warmer world.

Their paper, published in Nature, identifies aspects of how BRCA1-BARD1 functions, supporting future translational research, cancer prevention efforts and drug development.""BRCA1-BARD1 is important for DNA repair. It has direct relevance to cancer because hundreds of mutations in the BRCA1 and BARD1 genes have been identified in cancer patients,"" says Georges Mer, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic structural biologist and biochemist who is the lead author of the paper. ""But no one knows if these mutations, or variants of unknown significance, are cancer-predisposing or not because we do not know whether the variants are located in a region of BRCA1-BARD1 that is important for function. Now because we can see how BRCA1-BARD1 works, we have a good idea of what regions of BRCA1-BARD1 are important for function.""In a cell, the complex of DNA and histone proteins are complexed into what's called chromatin, and packaged into bundles called nucleosomes. DNA damage response proteins need to access chromatin to repair damaged DNA. BRCA1-BARD1 contributes to fixing broken DNA strands, which helps in the maintenance and survival of cells. But it is also a function that could possibly be blocked or inactivated if this is a strategy a cancer cell uses to survive chemotherapy.","Published: July 29, 2021"

Researchers led by ICREA researcher Dr. N ria L pez-Bigas at IRB Barcelona have developed a tool, based on machine learning methods, that evaluates the potential contribution of all possible mutations in a gene in a given type of tumour to the development and progression of cancer.In previous work that is already available to the scientific and medical community, the laboratory developed a method to identify those genes responsible for the onset, progression, and spread of cancer. ""BoostDM goes further: it simulates each possible mutation within each gene for a specific type of cancer and indicates which ones are key in the cancer process. This information helps us to understand how a tumour is caused at the molecular level and it can facilitate medical decisions regarding the most appropriate therapy for a patient,"" explains Dr. L pez-Bigas, head of the Biomedical Genomics lab. In addition, the tool will contribute to a better understanding of the initial processes of tumour development in different tissues.The new tool has been integrated into the IntOGen platform, developed by the same group and designed to be used by the scientific and medical community in research projects, and into the Cancer Genome Interpreter, also developed by this group and which is more focused on clinical decision-making by medical oncologists.BoostDM currently works with the mutational profiles of 28,000 genomes analysed from 66 types of cancer.

The dataset, which is publicly available for anyone in the community to browse and use, maps the fine structures and connectivity of 200,000 brain cells and close to 500 million synapses all contained in a cubic millimeter chunk of mouse brain   approximately the size of a grain of sand   from the visual neocortex, the part of the mammalian brain that processes what we see. The public data collection is hosted online by the Brain Observatory Storage Service & Database (BossDB), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is making these data freely accessible on the cloud through its Open Data Sponsorship Program. Google contributed storage and computing engine support through Google Cloud, and an open source visualization tool Neuroglancer through Google Research.This massive project, dubbed the Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) program, took five years to complete and was funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, or IARPA. The goal of the research funding was to mine brain-wiring information to improve machine learning. But the data are also valuable to the neuroscience field   both for scientists seeking to understand how the brain conveys information along defined circuits, and for biomedical researchers wanting to treat brain disorders where wiring or connections are altered. We re basically treating a brain circuit as a computer, and we asked three questions: What does it do? How is it wired up? What is the program?  said R. Clay Reid, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Investigator at the Allen Institute and one of the lead scientists of MICrONS.  Experiments were done to literally see the neurons  activity, to watch them compute. The reconstructions that we re presenting today let us see the elements of the neural circuit: the brain cells and the wiring, with the ability to follow the wires to map the connections between cells. The final step is to interpret this network, at which point we may be able to say we can read the brain s program. The dataset joins the ranks of other recently released wiring diagrams from human and fruit fly brains captured using the same technology, electron microscopy or EM. This method reveals incredible details of an entire microscopic landscape   in this case, the densely packed topography of tendrilled neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels and other cells that make up the brain s physical matter, as well as all the miniscule internal components of each cell. The newly released MICrONS data contains the most cells and connections of any such dataset to date, and it is large enough to capture entire local circuits and near-complete 3D shapes of individual mouse neurons. Some neurons make connections at incredibly long distances, sending their axons all the way across the brain, and those long-distance connections aren t represented fully in this dataset. But the cubic millimeter volume was chosen to catch circuits across multiple brain areas involved in vision while also capturing the structure of as many entire neurons as possible. Before the structural data was gathered, the research team at Baylor captured neurons  activity in this part of the brain as the mouse viewed images or movies of natural scenes. ""The neocortex contains billions of neurons communicating through trillions of connections that have endowed mammals with astonishing capabilities. A key question to untangling this bewildering complexity is to discover the relationships between the wiring rules and the functional properties of neurons,  said Andreas Tolias, Ph.D., Professor of Neuroscience and Director of the Center for Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence at Baylor College of Medicine and one of the lead scientists of MICrONS.  This program is unique since it enabled us to assemble an interdisciplinary team to perform a very ambitious experiment that will enable us to answer this question. After the Baylor experiments, Allen Institute researchers preserved and sliced the brain piece in more than 27,000 equally thin slices, capturing a total of 150 million images of those slices using customized electron microscopes. The research team at Princeton then used machine learning approaches to  segment  the images, defining each cell and its internal components individually. The end result: beautiful, intricate digital renderings of 200,000 brain cells and the connections between them, many of which had never been captured in their complete form before.  Our five-year mission had an ambitious goal that many regarded as unattainable. Today, we have been rewarded by breathtaking new vistas of the mammalian cortex,  said H. Sebastian Seung, Ph.D., Professor of Neuroscience and Computer Science at Princeton University and one of the lead scientists of MICrONS.  As we transition to a new phase of discovery, we are building a community of researchers to use the data in new ways. Only the collective efforts of this community can realize the resource s potential for enabling new discoveries about the brain. Access the MICrONS data here.

This is the first paper documenting stimulation of pollen germination by non-plants,  said first author Shawn Christensen, a doctoral candidate in associate professor Rachel Vannette s laboratory in the Department of Entomology and Nematology.  Nectar-dwelling Acinetobacter bacteria stimulate protein release by inducing pollen to germinate and burst, benefitting Acinetobacter. Acinetobacter is a genus of bacteria very common in flowers. They are usually among the most abundant bacteria in nectar and are often found on other floral tissues, including pollen and stigmas.The authors collected California poppies from the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden, and Acinetobacter primarily from nearby Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve, which is part of the UC Natural Reserve System. Despite the essential nutritional role of pollen for bees and other pollinators, we still know very little about how pollen is digested by anything,  Christensen said.  We found out that certain bacteria in flowers, Acinetobacter, can send a chemical signal to pollen that hijacks its systems and tells it to open the door from the inside releasing protein and nutrients for the bacteria. Christensen said the bacteria can double the amount of protein released from pollen. That makes it important for bacterial growth, but it could also be exploited by bees or other pollen consumers to get more nutrition from their food.The question of how organisms actually eat pollen has been a long-standing one. Pollen is well-protected by layers of resistant biopolymers, and it's unclear how pollen-eaters get through those protective layers. The bacteria have found what looks like a fairly unique and very effective way to get nutrients, which are otherwise scarce in a flower environment, said Vannette, a UC Davis Hellman Fellow.  It's a very neat biological trick. This finding opens the door for a lot of exciting new research: How do the bacteria do it? Given that Acinetobacter is often found on pollinators, do pollinators benefit from this? Could bacterial action on pollen make it more, or less, beneficial to pollen-eaters? And what about plants? Could the bacteria be reducing pollination by causing pollen to germinate before fertilization? We aim to investigate many of these possibilities in future work.

The study was pre-published in a recent online issue of the journal Brain. The Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) provided funding and expertise to study investigators, helping to bring this research into phase 2 clinical testing. Using two types of brain scans as biomarkers this study was able to measure improvements in brain metabolism among treated patients and correlate those improvements with cognitive changes and disease progression,  said study co-author Howard Fillit, M.D., ADDF s Founding Executive Director and Chief Science Officer.  Riluzole represents many of the ADDF s research priorities. It is a repurposed drug, which helps speed the research process. It targets an important and understudied biological mechanism that goes awry with aging, and the rigorous design of this trial measured both biomarker and clinical outcomes. The trial randomly assigned 50 patients aged 50 to 90 years to receive either the active drug (n=26) or placebo (n=24) twice daily for six months. Riluzole works by modulating a neurotransmitter in the brain called glutamate, which plays an essential role in the ability of nerve cells to send signals to one another. Glutamate dysregulation is thought to begin a cycle of toxicity that underlies the development of Alzheimer s disease.The study met its main primary outcome, confirming a difference in brain metabolic changes between patients on active treatment and placebo. The changes were measured and analyzed using a specialized PET scan that measures glucose metabolism called FDG PET. Changes in FDG PET scans correlated with cognitive decline and predicted Alzheimer s disease progression. In this trial, FDG PET progression scores also correlated with changes in patients  cognitive functions, including memory, attention, language, and visual-spatial skills.Secondary outcomes were also met, including significant changes in glutamate levels measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy, correlations between cognitive measures assessed through neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging biomarkers. Another primary endpoint, change in N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuron health, was not met. Finally, several regions of the brain showed preserved glucose metabolism, but most prominently a region called the posterior cingulate which is a hub network for Alzheimer s disease.The study found no difference in adverse events between the treatment and placebo groups. Using repurposed drugs like riluzole comes with the benefit of having, in this case, two decades of experience showing the drug s safety. This helps to speed and streamline costs of the drug testing process.Lead investigator Dr. Ana Pereira, Assistant Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, NY, said the promising results support moving the drug into a phase 3 trial with larger numbers of patients followed for a longer time for further testing of safety and efficacy. We are deeply appreciative to the ADDF not just for their investment in our work, but for their commitment to novel scientific approaches to Alzheimer s research,  said Dr. Pereira.Thanks to its deep connections throughout the Alzheimer s research community, the ADDF was able to connect Dr. Pereira with another of its funded investigators, Dawn Matthews, Chief Executive Officer at ADM Diagnostics, an ADDF-funded company. The two worked together on designing the trial to take advantage of new technology from ADM that allowed for a more robust analysis of the PET scan data.Reference: Matthews DC, Mao X, Dowd K, et al.

Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients was investigated in 13 studies comparing ivermectin with placebo or with no treatment in addition to comparable usual care in the study arms. Only one study investigated prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared ivermectin to no treatment. The review looked at the effects of ivermectin on the number of deaths, whether the patient s condition worsened or improved, and unwanted effects.The Cochrane review cannot confirm whether ivermectin (administered in hospital or as an outpatient) compared with placebo or usual care, leads to more or fewer deaths after one month, whether it improves or worsens patients  condition, increases or decreases unwanted side effects, nor whether it increases or reduces negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment. Likewise, the review cannot confirm whether or not ivermectin prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection or reduces number of deaths after high-risk exposure.Main authors on the review, Dr Maria Popp and Dr Stephanie Weibel, said:  The lack of good quality evidence on efficacy and safety of ivermectin arises from a study pool that consists mainly of small, insufficiently powered RCTs with overall limited quality regarding study design, conduct and reporting. Current evidence does not support using ivermectin for treating or preventing of COVID-19 unless they are part of well-designed randomized trials. LSTM's Professor Paul Garner, CIDG Co-ordinating Editor, said;  This is a great review from an experienced team. The hype around ivermectin is driven by some studies where the effect size for ivermectin is frankly not credible, and this has driven the conclusions in other reviews. The study with a huge effect has now been retracted as fake. Careful appraisal is the cornerstone of Cochrane s work, and with such extreme public demands for a drug to work during the pandemic, it remains vital that we hold onto our scientific principles to guide care.

Synthetic materials could be suitable as scaffolding for tissue because, unlike natural tissues, they remain stable in the organism long enough for the body to form new natural structures. A fundamental requirement for functional tissue is that blood vessels must be able to grow in them and connect to the organism s vascular system, so that the tissue is properly supplied with oxygen and nutrients. However, until now, almost nothing has been known about which material properties promote the growth of blood vessels. A team headed by biomedical engineer Dr Britta Trappmann from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in M nster, Germany, has developed a cell culture system in which, for the first time, a functional blood vessel system is able to grow within a framework made of synthetic materials.The scientists, working in a special hydrogel with properties they can change in a controlled manner, first grew a parent blood vessel from human blood vessel lining cells. They then investigated how the material properties of the artificial cell environment influenced the formation of additional blood vessels and fine-tuned them.Summarizing the key findings, Britta Trappmann highlights that  The synthetic tissue material must activate certain adhesion molecules in the membrane of blood vessel cells so that the cells migrate in groups from the parent vessel and form tubular structures.At the same time, the material must be sufficiently degradable for the cells to form blood vessels of adequate size . In order to mimic the natural environment of cells, many additional biomolecules and cells would have to be integrated into the model system in later steps   these may be signaling proteins, immune cells or cells to stabilize the blood vessels.  Moreover, the effect of all these factors is linked in natural tissues and varies from organ to organ,  Britta Trappmann explains. Understanding all of this, she says, is a long-term goal but, ultimately, the knowledge might then be used to grow implantable tissues.","Published: July 29, 2021"

Of course, self-tests are widely available, but the fact remains that these are still less sensitive and accurate than laboratory tests. But you may be waiting one or more days for the result from a laboratory test, and that can be too long,  adds Merkx.Another issue with these so-called point-of-use home tests is that they are not accurate enough.  Output from a corona self-test is a simple yes or no, positive or negative,  says Merkx, who is also based at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at TU/e.

Now, in a step toward a safe, long-lasting and reversible male contraceptive, researchers reporting in ACS Nano Letters have developed magnetic, biodegradable nanomaterials that reduced the likelihood of mice fathering pups for at least 30 days.Elevated temperatures, which can be caused by wearing too-tight pants or underwear, can decrease sperm count in men. Some researchers have explored the more intense heating of nanomaterials injected into the testes as a form of male birth control. However, the injection can be painful, the heating can damage skin, and most nanomaterials tested so far are not biodegradable. Weihua Ding, Fei Sun and colleagues wanted to develop a safe, effective magnetic-thermal approach to male contraception that doesn t need to be injected directly into the testes.The researchers tested two forms of iron oxide nanoparticles, which are biodegradable and can be guided and heated with magnetic fields, as male contraceptives. One type of nanoparticle was coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the other with citric acid. Although the PEG-coated nanoparticles could be heated to higher temperatures, they were not as easily manipulated by magnets as the other ones. So the researchers injected repeated doses of citric acid-coated nanoparticles into the bloodstream of mice for 2 days, guided the nanomaterials to the testes with magnets, and then applied an alternating magnetic field to the area for 15 minutes. The nanoparticles heated the testes to a temperature of 104 F, shrinking them and inhibiting spermatogenesis before gradual recovery 30 to 60 days after treatment. The mice couldn t father any pups 7 days after treatment, but they were back to fathering about 12 pups per pregnant female at day 60. The nanoparticles were non-toxic to cells and were gradually eliminated from the body, offering new possibilities for male contraception, the researchers say.Reference: Ding W, Chen Z, Gu Y, Chen Z, Zheng Y, Sun F.

Despite the reduction in malaria over recent decades, there were still 229 million cases of malaria in 2019   an increase on the previous year   and 409,000 deaths.Co-lead author of the study Dr Drew Hammond, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London and the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, said:  The challenges facing malaria elimination have intensified in recent years, due in part to the spread of insecticide resistance and large gaps in funding for parts of sub-Saharan Africa.""Sadly, researchers estimate that COVID-19 related disruptions may have doubled mortality from malaria in 2020, threatening a setback of several decades. Gene drive is a self-sustaining and fast acting technology that can work alongside existing tools such as bed nets, insecticides and vaccines   and could be a game-changer in bringing about malaria elimination. Targetting mosquitoesThe team selectively targeted the specific mosquito species Anopheles gambiae, which is responsible for most of the malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. There are around 3,500 species of mosquito worldwide, of which a very small fraction can carry malaria, with only a handful of species being responsible for the vast majority of malaria cases.The hope is that mosquitoes carrying a gene drive would be released in the future, spreading a modification that impairs female fertility to ultimately reduce the total number of malaria-carrying mosquitoes as a new tool to prevent malaria transmission.Previously, Imperial researchers demonstrated that their gene drive technology could collapse A. gambiae populations in small cages within 7-11 generations as no more offspring were produced once the gene drive had spread to all individuals.However, to test whether the gene drive would still spread and cause the same population suppression in real-world conditions, the team moved to testing the technology in much larger cages that mimic the mosquito s natural habitat in the confined laboratory of Polo GGB in Terni, Italy.Mimicking natural conditionsTesting in large indoor cages that simulate the natural environment is a critical step of the development pathway suggested by the World Health Organisation and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gene drive technologies in a physically confined laboratory before open release.Any mosquito strain that is released into the wild must be able to compete with the wild population if it is to be used for vector control. The large cages used for the study contained hundreds of mosquitoes of different ages, representing a more natural and complex population structure.The purpose-built cages were also designed to mimic natural conditions in a way that cannot be achieved in small scale testing facilities, enticing the mosquitoes to engage in complex mating, resting, foraging and egg-laying behaviours that would be otherwise impossible in small cages.This was achieved by controlling not only temperature and humidity, but also by providing natural landmarks and specialised lighting designed to simulate sunrise and sunset and induce swarming.Modified mosquitoes carrying the gene drive elements were released at initial frequencies of 12.5 and 25 percent of the population, and researchers traced how quickly this element spread and its impact on female fertility and eventual population decline.They found that each of the cages (two at 12.5 percent initial frequency and two at 25 percent) showed a rapid spread of the gene drive and complete population collapse within one year.Overcoming resistanceA major barrier to the development of gene drives has been the emergence of mutations resistant to the technology. However, the strain tested here is the first and only strain to show no signs of resistance in small or large-scale testing   no new natural modifications arose to counteract the effect of the gene drive.Co-lead authors of the study Dr Tania Persampieri and Paola Pollegioni, from Polo GGB and the CNR-Research Institute on Terrestrial Ecosystems, said:  Our large-cage studies provide a greater selection pressure for resistance to the gene drive to arise, as there may be additional  fitness costs  when the mosquitoes exhibit natural mating and egg-laying behaviours that are impacted in ways we couldn t predict from small-cage studies. However, no modifications arose that could render the mosquito doublesex gene resistant to our gene drive, suggesting our modification driving female infertility is robust. The large-cage trials are a major step on the journey to releasing gene-drive-carrying mosquitoes into the wild, but the team stress there are still safety and efficacy testing and potential technology developments before a field evaluation could be planned, including more comprehensive resistance testing and environmental risk assessments.However, they say the data obtained from this study will be invaluable to future modelling that aims to predict the spread of a gene drive in specific regions, such as in the field site in Burkina Faso where a testing facility has been built.Reference: Hammond A, Pollegioni P, Persampieri T, et al.

The currently employed method of light-sheet microscopy combined with chemical protocols capable of rendering biological tissues transparent, fails to maintain high resolution in samples larger than a few hundred microns. Dr Leonardo Sacconi, of the National Institute of Optics of the National Research Council (CNR-INO), a co-author of the paper, added:  ""Beyond these dimensions, the biological tissue begins to behave like a lens, disrupting the alignment of the microscope and consequently making the images blurry.""With RAPID, the researchers propose a new auto-focusing technology compatible with light-sheet microscopy that is capable of automatically correcting the misalignments introduced by the sample itself in real time. In cubic centimetre-sized, cleared samples, such as intact mouse brains, the autofocussing removes image degradation to enable enhanced quantitative analyses.The new method is inspired by the optical autofocus systems found in reflex cameras, where a set of prisms and lenses transforms the blur of the image into a lateral movement. This allows the alignment of the microscope to be stabilized in real time, producing sharper, more richly-detailed images.Dr Caroline M llenbroich, a Marie Sk odowska Curie fellow and lecturer at the University of Glasgow s School of Physics and Astronomy is a co-author of the paper. Dr M llenbroich contributed to the design and implementation of the microscope and autofocusing system.Dr M llenbroich said:  While we originally invented RAPID for light-sheet microscopy, this autofocusing technology is actually suitable for all wide-field microscopy techniques. It is very versatile and sample agnostic with multiple applications beyond neuroscience. The high resolution guaranteed by RAPID - which is also the subject of an international patent owned by Unifi, the European Laboratory of Nonlinear Spectroscopy (LENS) and CNR - has allowed researchers to study on a whole-brain scale problems previously analysed only in small, local areas.For example, the spatial distribution of a particular type of neurons - which express somatostatin - has been investigated, showing how these cells tend to organize themselves in spatial clusters, which are suspected to make their inhibitory action more effective.Another application concerns microglia, a set of cells with different functions (from the response to pathogens to the regulation of neuronal plasticity), whose shape changes according to the role they play. The analysis of microglia performed with RAPID revealed significant differences between various brain regions, paving the way for new studies on the role of this cell population.Reference: Silvestri L, M llenbroich MC, Costantini I, et al.

The chemical messenger has been extensively studied from the perspective of external cues, or  deterministic  signals. Instead, University of California San Diego researchers recently set out to investigate less understood aspects related to spontaneous impulses of dopamine. Their results, published July 23 in the journal Current Biology, have shown that mice can willfully manipulate these random dopamine pulses.Rather than only occurring when presented with pleasurable, or reward-based expectations, UC San Diego graduate student Conrad Foo led research that found that the neocortex in mice is flooded with unpredictable impulses of dopamine that occur approximately once per minute.Working with colleagues at UC San Diego (Department of Physics and Section of Neurobiology) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, Foo investigated whether mice are in fact aware that these impulses documented in the lab through molecular and optical imaging techniques are actually occurring. The researchers devised a feedback scheme in which mice on a treadmill received a reward if they showed they were able to control the impromptu dopamine signals. Not only were mice aware of these dopamine impulses, the data revealed, but the results confirmed that they learned to anticipate and volitionally act upon a portion of them. Critically, mice learned to reliably elicit (dopamine) impulses prior to receiving a reward,  the researchers note in the paper.  These effects reversed when the reward was removed. We posit that spontaneous dopamine impulses may serve as a salient cognitive event in behavioral planning. The researchers say the study opens a new dimension in the study of dopamine and brain dynamics. They now intend to extend this research to explore if and how unpredictable dopamine events drive foraging, which is an essential aspect of seeking sustenance, finding a mate and as a social behavior in colonizing new home bases. We further conjecture that an animal s sense of spontaneous dopamine impulses may motivate it to search and forage in the absence of known reward-predictive stimuli,  the researchers noted.In their efforts to control dopamine, the researchers clarified that dopamine appears to invigorate, rather than initiate, motor behavior. This started as a serendipitous finding by a talented, and curious, graduate student with intellectual support from a wonderful group of colleagues,  said study senior co-author David Kleinfeld, a professor in the Department of Physics (Division of Physical Sciences) and Section of Neurobiology (Division of Biological Sciences).  As an unanticipated result, we spent many long days expanding on the original study and of course performing control experiments to verify the claims. These led to the current conclusions.

Patterns detected on the scans may help guide follow up treatment as well as improve recruitment and research study design for head injury clinical trials.Researchers led by Geoffrey Manley, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurological surgery at the University of California San Francisco, conducted CT scans in 1,935 subjects with mild TBI and followed their outcomes up to 12 months after injury.This research was part of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study, a large research effort funded by the National Institutes of Health to improve understanding of the short- and long-term effects of head injury and to identify potential treatments.The researchers identified three distinct sets of patterns on the CT scans, indicating different types of damage after head injury which were associated with various outcomes. The results suggest that contusion (bleeding into brain tissue), subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid over the brain), subdural hematoma (bleeding between the brain and the thick covering over the brain), and intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the fluid filled spaces in the center of the brain) were associated with worse outcomes 12 months after injury. Epidural hematoma, which describes bleeding between the skull and outer brain covering known as the dura, was associated with incomplete recovery at two weeks and three months, but was not linked to negative longer-term outcomes.The TRACK-TBI study was designed and executed in collaboration with the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study of 2594 TBI subjects. Both sets of results showed similar patterns on CT scans and similar associations between CT abnormalities with clinical outcomes.More research is needed to understand the effects of head injury on brain structure and function, and how different types of injury can lead to various short- and long-term outcomes.Reference: Yuh EL, Jain S, Sun X, et al.

There is also concern these microplastics will carry potentially harmful bacteria such as E. coli, which are commonly found in coastal waters, up the food chain. Researchers from the University of Portsmouth tested a theory that microplastics covered in a layer of microbes, (called a biofilm) were more likely to be ingested by oysters than microplastics that were clean. Although the experiment was carried out on oysters under laboratory conditions, scientists believe similar results could be found in other edible marine species that also filter seawater for food. We know microplastics can be the mechanism by which bacteria are concentrated in coastal waters and this shows that they are more readily taken up by shellfish, and can be transferred to humans or other marine life. Dr Jo Preston , Reader in Marine Ecology and Evolution at the University of Portsmouth Up until now, studies to test the impacts of microplastics on marine life have typically used  clean, virgin microplastics. However, this is not representative of what happens to microplastics in the marine environment.  Microbes readily colonise microplastics that enter the ocean. In this study, published in Science of the Total Environment, scientists compared the uptake rates of clean microplastics versus microplastics with an E.coli biofilm coating.  The results were worrying -  oysters contained 10 times more microplastics when exposed to the biofilm coated beads. It is hypothesised that these coated MPs appeared to be more like food to the oysters, explaining their preferential ingestion over clean microplastics.The scientists say the implications for the food chain are concerning. The ingestion of microplastics is not only bad for the oysters, but it affects human health too. The plastic does not break down in the marine animal and is consumed when we eat it.  This research give us further insight into the potential harm microplastics are having on the food chain. It is clear that further study is urgently needed. Professor Steve Fletcher , Director of the University s Revolution Plastics initiative Lead researcher, Dr Joanne Preston, Reader in Marine Ecology and Evolution at the University of Portsmouth, said:  What we ve discovered is that microplastic really is the Trojan Horse of the marine world.  We discovered that clean plastics had little impact on the oysters  respiration and feeding rates - but did have an impact when you fed them the microplastic hidden in the biofilm.  The oysters took in more and it affected their health.  It is unsure exactly how much this could affect the food chain, but the likelihood is because the creatures are ingesting more plastic and potentially, disease causing organisms, this will ultimately have a negative effect on human health. We know microplastics can be the mechanism by which bacteria are concentrated in coastal waters and this shows that they are more readily taken up by shellfish, and can be transferred to humans or other marine life. Dr Preston said:  We have successfully tested a hypothesis   this opens the door for more research on environmentally relevant studies of the long term impacts of biofilm coated microplastics on a wider range of marine life. We also need to study the transfer of microbes up the food chain via plastics in much greater detail. Professor Steve Fletcher, Director of the University s Revolution Plastics initiative, said:  ""The findings in this research give us further insight into the potential harm microplastics are having on the food chain.  It demonstrates how we could be vastly underestimating the effect that microplastics currently have. It is clear that further study is urgently needed.""Reference: Fabra M, Williams L, Watts JEM, Hale MS, Couceiro F, Preston J.

Mice with a hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer survived significantly longer after vaccination than unvaccinated animals. Combining the vaccination with an anti-inflammatory drug increased the protective effect.In so-called microsatellite unstable cancers, an important cellular repair system that normally corrects small DANN errors has failed. If such DNA defects remain uncorrected, the protein's entire blueprint can go out of sync. The cells then form novel protein structures, so-called neoantigens, which are often recognized as foreign by the immune system.Microsatellite unstable (MSI) tumors can develop spontaneously or as a result of a hereditary predisposition, Lynch syndrome. About a quarter of MSI colon tumors are caused by Lynch syndrome. About half of those affected develop cancer during their lifetime.A team led by Magnus von Knebel Doeberitz, who heads a research division based both at Heidelberg University Hospital and at the German Cancer Research Center, has been able to show in many years of preliminary work that many patients with Lynch syndrome share identical mutations and thus identical neoantigens in their tumors.""We therefore wanted to test whether such frequently occurring neoantigens are capable of activating the immune system against the tumor cells as a protective vaccine and thus preventing cancer from developing,"" says Matthias Kloor, who leads the research on preventive vaccinations in Lynch syndrome.A phase I/IIa clinical trial initiated by the Heidelberg researchers on the safety and immunological efficacy of such a vaccination has already been successfully completed at the Northwest Hospital in Frankfurt*. Whether this vaccination can actually prevent tumors and prolong patient survival, however, will only become clear in a few years.But the team led by von Knebel Doeberitz and Kloor has already achieved an important milestone on the road to cancer vaccination. With their current work, the researchers have shown for the first time in an animal model that protective vaccination with MSI-typical neoantigens can actually protect against cancer. For this purpose, the team studied a mouse strain that develops colorectal cancer as a result of a defect in DNA repair enzymes - comparable to humans suffering from Lynch syndrome. The ""Lynch mice"" develop tumors in the intestine from the age of six months and die a few weeks or months later.In collaboration with Steven Lipkin from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and colleagues from other U.S. research institutions, the Heidelberg team identified various protein structures in the Lynch mice that occur as a result of the DNA defects. A special algorithm predicted which of these neoantigens could trigger a strong immune response in mice. Four vaccine peptides were eventually selected for the experiments.The vaccinated mice survived an average of 351 days, whereas unvaccinated animals survived only 263 days. The tumor mass was also significantly lower in the vaccinated animals. If the mice received the drug naproxen in addition to the vaccine, this further increased the preventive effect of the vaccination. Naproxen is an anti-inflammatory and painkiller that, like aspirin, belongs to the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Agents from this group are already recommended for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome in some countries.""Even in unvaccinated Lynch mice, we have seen that the immune system is active against the four neoantigens,"" explains Magnus von Knebel Doeberitz. ""So our vaccination enhances an already existing natural immune response against the cancer cells.""""We were able to demonstrate for the first time in a living organism that vaccination with neoantigens protects against cancer,"" emphasizes Matthias Kloor, adding, ""What is particularly promising is that immune protection and prevention with an anti-inflammatory seem to complement each other in their effect. The results show that vaccination against hereditary cancers is a promising concept that we now want to transfer further into clinical application.""Reference: Gebert J, Gelincik O, Oezcan-Wahlbrink M, et al.

Quite a lot, according to University of California, Riverside, researchers who have published a study exploring the insect s sense of taste. Insect feeding behavior directly impacts humans in many ways, from disease-carrying mosquitos that seek human blood to pests whose appetite can wreak havoc on the agricultural sector,  said Anupama Dahanukar, an associate professor of molecular, cell and systems biology, who led the study appearing in the Journal of Neuroscience.  How insect taste neurons are organized and how they function is critical for a deeper understanding of their feeding behavior. The fruit fly has multiple taste organs throughout its body to detect chemicals, called tastants, that signal whether a food is palatable or harmful. It is still unclear, however, how individual neurons in each taste organ act to control feeding. To explore this question, Dahanukar s team used the fly pharynx as a model to study whether taste information regulates sugar and amino acid consumption at the cellular level.Dahanukar explained animals rely heavily on the sense of taste to make feeding decisions, such as consuming nutritive foods while avoiding toxic ones.  In mammals, taste information is encoded by specialized cells present in taste buds of the tongue,  she said.  Taste receptors expressed in these cells can detect different chemicals. Molecular and functional differences in receptors expressed in different cells allow recognition of different tastes, such as salty, sour, sweet, bitter, or umami. Several new studies in flies indicate individual taste neurons can detect compounds belonging to more than one taste category, raising some questions about the distinct behavioral roles of individual taste neurons. If many classes of taste neurons are activated by sugar, for example, how does activation of just one class of taste neurons affect behavior?Dahanukar s team answered this question by genetically engineering a fly in which only a single defined class of pharyngeal neurons is active. The team then tested this fly in different feeding experiments to understand what the fly can or cannot do compared to animals that have all their taste neurons intact. We found single-taste neurons are capable of responding and activating behavioral responses to more than one tastant category   sweet and amino acids in our study,  said Yu-Chieh David Chen, the first author of the research paper.  We also found that a single tastant category   amino acids in our study   can activate multiple classes of taste neurons.  The team also tested flies that had no functional taste neurons. Such flies were incapable of making any proper feeding decisions, no matter the food choices   whether these were two attractive stimuli, one attractive and one aversive, or one nutritive and the other nonnutritive.The researchers found food choice decisions cannot be made in the absence of taste input; the latter is critical for ensuring appropriate food choice and feeding behavior. Further, flies that had pharyngeal sweet taste neurons as the only source of taste input were consistently able to select more palatable food.  Altogether, our results argue for the existence of a combinatorial coding system, wherein multiple neurons coordinate the response to any given tastant,  Dahanukar said.The study is the first to directly test the impact of loss of all taste neurons on behavioral responses to tastants of different categories. It is also the first to test whether a single class of taste neurons is sufficient for food choice and feeding behavior. Along with several other recent studies in the field, our work also invites revisiting some established ideas about how insect taste is organized,  Dahanukar said.  Rather than encoding tastes as in mammals, flies appear to encode some combination of valence   attractive versus aversive   and tastant identity. Her team anticipates that knowing how taste neurons work in flies will facilitate insect studies of greater health or agricultural importance.  We are building tools for asking the same sorts of questions in mosquitoes,  Dahanukar said.  Such studies could offer potential targets for manipulating feeding behaviors of pests or disease vectors in surveillance or control strategies. She acknowledged that her lab has only evaluated a single taste neuron within the system it set up, with many more remaining to be studied.  We are interested in understanding what these neurons sense and how they act, individually and as part of a group, to control parameters that lead to either promotion or cessation of food intake,  said Vaibhav Menon, a graduate student in Dahanukar s lab and a co-author on the study. The team plans to apply some of the same strategies to investigate how feeding behavior is controlled in mosquitoes.Dahanukar, Chen, and Menon were joined in the study by Ryan Matthew Joseph.

Previous research has shown that interactions between rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses can affect the type and severity of infections in individuals, and the way in which they infect and circulate around groups of people (patterns of infection).Viruses only infect a small number of cell types within the body, and respiratory viruses typically infect cells within the respiratory tract.In the study, the researchers first infected human respiratory cells with SARS-CoV-2 in the lab, recreating the cellular environment in which infections normally occur. They then studied the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells, both in the presence and absence of rhinovirus.The CVR's Professor Pablo Murcia explained:  Our research shows that human rhinovirus triggers an innate immune response in human respiratory epithelial cells which blocks the replication of the COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2.""This means that the immune response caused by mild, common cold virus infections could provide some level of transient protection against SARS-CoV-2, potentially blocking transmission and reducing the severity of COVID-19. The next stage will be to study what is happening at the molecular level during these virus-virus interactions, to understand more about their impact on disease transmission.""We can then use this knowledge to our advantage, hopefully developing strategies and control measures for COVID-19 infections.

Drug combinations are a particularly promising approach for slowing resistance, but the evolutionary impacts of combination therapy remain difficult to predict, especially in a clinical setting,  explains first author Erida Gjini, Researcher at the Department of Mathematics, Instituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.  Interactions between antibiotics can accelerate, reduce or even reverse the evolution of resistance, and resistance to one drug might also influence resistance to another. These interactions involve genes, competing evolutionary pathways and external stressors, making it a complex scenario to pick apart. In their study, Gjini and co-author Kevin Wood of the University of Michigan, US, sought to simplify things. They took a fundamental measurement of microbe fitness   their growth rate, measured by a simple growth curve over time   and linked this to resistance to two theoretical drugs. In the model, they assumed that drug-resistant mutants respond to a high concentration of drug in exactly the same way that drug-sensitive cells respond to a low concentration of drug. This rescaling assumption means that the growth behaviour of mutants can be inferred from the behaviour of the ancestral (sensitive) cells, simply by measuring their growth over a range of concentrations. The team then connected this assumption to a famous statistical relationship, called the Price equation, to explain how drug interactions and cross-resistance impact the way populations evolve resistance quantitatively and adapt to drug combinations.This rescaling model showed that the selection of resistance traits is determined by both the drug interaction and by cross-resistance (where cells develop resistance to one of the drugs and become resistant to the second drug at the same time). A mixture of two drugs in the model leads to markedly different growth trajectories and rates of growth adaptation, depending on how the drugs interact. For example, growth adaptation can be slowed by drugs that mutually weaken one another   drugs that interact  antagonistically    but the effect can be tempered or even reversed if resistance to one drug is highly correlated with resistance to the other. The predictions of the model help explain counterintuitive behavior observed in past experiments, such as the slowed evolution seen when combinations of tigecycline and ciprofloxacin   two antibiotics commonly used in clinical settings   are applied simultaneously to the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.Having established the basic model, the team then added in the effect of mutations on drug resistance. They looked at two different routes to accumulating mutations: in the first, there was a uniform pathway between the ancestral genetics and all possible mutation combinations. In the second, they assumed that mutations must arise in a specific sequence. They used a theoretical combination of two drugs, one at a higher dose than the other, and found that the sequential pathway leads to slower adaptation of growth, reflecting its evolution to the first fittest mutant before adapting further.In addition to being able to include mutations in the model, the team also tested whether they could predict the effects of different timings and sequences of antibiotic treatment. They studied two sequential regimes, A and B, based on different dosage combinations of tigecycline and ciprofloxacin. They found that both the resistance levels to the two drugs and the growth rate increases during treatment, as they anticipated. But the dynamics of this increase depends on the relative duration of each treatment and the total treatment length. We have built a model that incorporates drug interactions and cross-resistance to predict how microbes will adapt over time in a way that can then be experimentally measured,  concludes co-author Wood, who is an Associate Professor at U-M s Departments of Biophysics and Physics.  In contrast to the classical genetics-based approaches to studying drug resistance, we used simple scaling assumptions   something commonly used in physics   to dramatically reduce the complexity of the problem. The approach helps us unravel a number of competing evolutionary effects and may eventually offer a framework for optimising time-dependent, multidrug treatments. Reference: Gjini E, Wood KB.

Our findings suggest that several forms of public messages can increase vaccination intentions, but messaging that emphasizes personal health benefits had the largest impact,  says UW Ph.D. student Madison Ashworth, lead author of a paper that appears today in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The new research is the latest in a series of coronavirus-related studies conducted by UW College of Business economists Ashworth, Linda Thunstrom, Todd Cherry, Stephen Newbold and David Finnoff.The researchers were among the first to identify vaccine hesitancy as a potential stumbling block in the effort to end the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccine hesitancy has turned out to be prevalent. Recent surveys suggest that 60-70 percent of U.S. adults intend to be vaccinated for COVID-19, which falls short of the threshold identified by public health experts to achieve herd immunity.To examine the impact on vaccine intentions of a variety of public health messages, the researchers surveyed a representative sample of 3,048 adults in the United States. The economists compared three messages that described the benefits of taking the vaccine: benefits to personal health; benefits to the health of family, friends and community members; and benefits to local and national economies -- as well as a fourth message that emphasized the rigor and safety protocols of the vaccine development process. They also examined the effect of combining multiple messages.The message about private health benefits increased intended vaccinations by 16 percentage points, significantly more than the other messages. The strong response to the private benefit message may partly reflect the political polarization of vaccine hesitancy in the U.S.,  the researchers wrote.  Conservatives are more hesitant and have a particularly individualistic worldview. They might, therefore, be particularly responsive to information that stresses private benefits. Our data offer some support for this idea: The effect of the private benefit message on vaccine intentions is larger for conservatives than for moderates or liberals. The increase in vaccine intentions was stronger for a group that received only the private benefit message than it was for a group that received all three messages, the economists note. This suggests there are no benefits to communicating several different types of benefits, potentially due to information overload,  they wrote.The researchers also say the source of information also likely matters, and trusted sources may vary across subgroups. For example, previous research shows that messages promoting social distancing are more effective coming from a family physician than from a governor or private citizen.The new study shows that people with low trust in government agencies are 14 percentage points less likely to want a vaccine, compared to those with medium trust. Of those who don t want to be vaccinated, 90 percent worry about the vaccine s side-effects and novelty, and 75 percent lack trust in vaccine developers and the Food and Drug Administration to truthfully disclose a vaccine s risks and effectiveness. Our vaccine safety message did little to overcome a lack of confidence in the vaccine,  says Ashworth, who is from Star Valley.While their findings show that messages about the private benefits of COVID-19 vaccination are most effective, the economists suggest more research to explore the effectiveness of different information channels for promoting vaccines.Reference: Ashworth M, Thunstr m L, Cherry TL, Newbold SC, Finnoff DC.

For this purpose, scientists selected 30 compounds from fruits and vegetables and conducted a series of experiments. Using computer simulations, researchers determined which groups of compounds and how they affect proteins in cells. A description of the compounds and the results of the study are published in the journal Scientific Reports.""To create powerful new drugs that will target tumors, we need to determine how food compounds affect cellular proteins in cancer prevention and therapy. Therefore, by modeling molecular mechanisms, we figured out how substances bind to proteins. This allowed us to identify a pool of therapeutic targets that will be subsequently affected by the drugs. For example, these are anti-apoptotic (prevent apoptosis) and pro-apoptotic (induce apoptosis) proteins, protein kinases, and others. But the key target for drugs is phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. It is this enzyme that influences cancer mutations, gene rearrangement and amplification,"" explains Grigory Zyryanov, leading researcher at the laboratory of organic synthesis of the UrFU Center for Chemical and Pharmaceutical Technologies Innovation, Professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences.Scientists have also found that silybinin, flavopyridol, oleandrin, ursolic, oleanolic, alpha- and beta-boswellic acids, triterpenoid and guggulsterone have broad-spectrum anticancer properties. These compounds and enzymes are found in non-starchy plants such as broccoli, cabbage, spinach, cauliflower, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, leeks, rutabaga and turnips. Natural alkaloids, monoterpenes, organosulfides, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes and isoflavones also contribute to cancer prevention and therapy. Specific individual natural substances or their combinations are needed for specific cancer therapies. For example, resveratrol (found in abundance in grape skins) or pterostilbene (present in blueberries) inhibit stem cell metastasis in breast cancer. Indole-3-carbinol (cabbage is its main source) has a wide range of antitumor effects and protects cells in breast, colon, cervical, and endometriosis cancers.""In India and China, it is commonly believed that many medicines can be obtained directly from natural sources. We assumed that the products selected for the study had anti-cancer properties, but this had to be tested. As a result, we found out that sick cells stop developing under the influence of certain combinations of food compounds,"" states Grigory Zyryanov.As a result, the researchers selected the ten most promising compounds for further study. The results obtained are the basis for the development of new drugs with greater efficacy and targeting of cancer cells without side effects for the body.""This is not the first year that we and our Chinese and Indian colleagues have been searching for anti-cancer compounds.

A team of researchers have now discovered a catalyst that achieves exceptionally high-precision addition of hydrogen to carbon-carbon bonds, improving targeted synthesis by avoiding convoluted multi-step processes, and reducing wasteful by-products. In the journal Angewandte Chemie, the authors herald the reaction as especially useful in the production of complex natural substances such as pheromones.The natural world contains a vast array of natural products, many of which have also become indispensable drugs for humans. For example, plant-based natural substances such as polyketides and pheromones have significant potential as antitumor drugs and antibiotics. However, many of these pharmaceutically active substances are only effective in one of their two possible configurations, akin to mirror images of each other, and may even be harmful in the other form.To ensure that the right substance is produced, synthetic chemists generally have no choice but to be wasteful: either by using convoluted processes or performing a number of different steps. For example, they might synthesize both forms of a compound, then have to eliminate the unwanted one, or they might use a specific, but potentially expensive, catalyst to only produce the form of interest.Pher G. Andersson and his team from Stockholm University, Sweden, have now discovered that a catalyst made of the heavy metal iridium and organic phosphorus-nitrogen units is exceptionally good at hydrogenating symmetrical organic compounds. The ensuing reaction is not only highly economical, with no by-products formed, but also particularly important for drug synthesis since the configuration that is, the handedness of the product is decided at the time of hydrogenation.Simple, symmetrical unsaturated bonds are suitable as precursors for the synthesis of polyketides and pheromone-derived natural products. The team s iridium catalyst now makes it possible to hydrogenate one of the symmetrical carbon-carbon bonds in a targeted way:  This method represents the first example of iridium-catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetrization of dienes,  the authors say. They demonstrated just how useful their new method could be using dozens of precursor substances that they converted to the desired products. In every case, virtually no by-products were formed.The target configuration at the oxygen group near an unsaturated bond was decisive in the success of this approach. Many pheromones or polyketides contain the so-called allyl carbinols with this oxygen-carbon arrangement, while others contain nitrogen groups and are referred to as allyl carbamines. Regardless of whether the iridium catalyst was used on nitrogen or oxygen, it gave the correct end configuration. Another common structural motif in natural substances is the lactones. Even confronted with this structure, the iridium catalyst performed well and the researchers were able to find a simple synthesis route by hydrogenative desymmetrization.The authors also used the new method to carry out formal total synthesis of two natural substances: firstly, zaragozic acid, a polyketide obtained from fungi, and secondly, invictolide, an ant pheromone. The authors are confident that, because of the high level of selectivity and the virtually total preference for one configuration, giving the product with the correct handedness, the method is an economical and versatile alternative for synthesizing many pharmaceutical products.Reference: Wu H, Su H, Schulze EJ, et al.

Their perspective, drawn from a review of studies to date, appears July 27 in Frontiers in Genetics.During cell death, which is a normal part of tissue regeneration, cfDNA is shed from tissue. The shed cfDNA can be isolated from a blood sample, thus providing a reading of cell death across the body in both normal and cancer cells without the need for taking invasive biopsy samples.""Taking tumor tissue biopsies is a hit or miss process and is usually not a good representation of the whole tumor or its spread,"" says Anton Wellstein, MD, PhD, professor of oncology and pharmacology at Georgetown Lombardi and corresponding author for this article. ""Using blood, or liquid biopsies, on the other hand, provides a homogeneous representation of cfDNA that is being shed from all types of cells.""The scientists note that short fragments of DNA and chemical modifications to those fragments, known as methyl groups, help tell researchers what cell type the respective snippet of DNA came from because these methylation patterns are unique to specific cell types. By using cfDNA to compare damage to cells from various forms of treatment with undamaged normal cells from the same tissue, the researchers can analyze a treasure-trove of data about how the cells in a tissue are affected by treatments and other external forces. This knowledge could be key in assessing if a therapy is effective and what adverse effects it may cause.""Fine-tuning these applications of cfDNA analysis is challenging and requires in-depth approaches, both at the genome sequencing level and computationally,"" explains Megan Barefoot, a MD/PhD student in the Wellstein lab at the Cancer Center and lead author of the article. ""Methylated cfDNA has opened a new and minimally invasive way to detect damage to cells in the body as there are often hundreds of methyl markers per cell that can mark, very specifically, where the cells came from, much like a barcode scanner at a grocery checkout tells the store the identity of a particular product. Combined biological and computational analyses make deciphering these methylation patterns/molecular barcodes possible so that researchers can trace the origins of cfDNA.""The end-result of these analyses aids investigators in determining the tissue of origin of a cancer, for example, and also allows researchers, when comparing damaged cells to healthy cells, to see where the damage originated, especially if it was due to a certain type of treatment.""This approach can be applied to any therapy that will impact tissue equilibrium by causing cells in tissues to become damaged and die, including chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. This review really helps set the stage for our future research efforts,"" concludes Wellstein. ""My lab is very actively pursuing methods and technologies that further refine analyses of methylated cfDNA. We believe these efforts are affordable and will soon become standard in labs and they should make a difference in advancing the understanding and treatment of many cancers.""This article has been republished from the following materials.

The research was led by graduate student James O Connor and Professor Andrea Page-McCaw in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, and Shane Hutson, chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy and professor of physics and biological sciences.Cells that cover the body and its organs, known as epithelial cells, must be able to heal wounds, as they are uniquely subjected to all kinds of insults and abrasions.  When these cells detect a wound nearby, they change their behaviors,  said Page-McCaw.  They transition from stationary, nondividing, noninvasive cells to cells that migrate, divide and invade.  This also describes the behaviors of cancer cells, which adopt wound-healing behaviors without any wound.The trans-institutional team of scientists started by looking into the earliest known response of epithelial cells to a nearby wound: an increase in calcium levels. This increase typically occurs within a minute of wounding. We were able to connect the response of these cells directly to the cellular damage inherent in wounding,  Page-McCaw said.  We found that wounds destroy cells, causing them to leak or even burst, and some of their contents gets out. Outside of cells, tissues have a detector molecule ready to sense these cellular contents. When they do, proteases in the cellular contents chop up the detector molecule into smaller pieces, which spread to nearby cells. This activates receptors on the cells  surfaces, giving them the information that a wound is nearby. The multidisciplinary collaboration with Hutson s lab brought the convergence of experimental biology and theoretical mathematical modeling together.  James O Connor led the experiments,  Page-McCaw said,  and we worked collaboratively with the Hutson lab to analyze the data quantitatively. Aaron Stevens, graduate student in the Hutson lab, generated a mathematical model that showed this scenario is plausible if the cells release their contents slowly, rather than all at once. This finding was an interesting aspect that we had not noticed, but we were able to go back and see evidence for such a slow release. ","Published: July 28, 2021"

For instance, people in the community know which trees have the sweetest fruit   but now with help of the toolkit, they can measure the sugar levels of fruit on the tree to get an external measure of its sweetness. Indigenous enterprises and interested buyers need to know product supply logistical measurements like the weight and size of the fruit (its pulp to seed ratio); how much sugar and salt content and acidity levels are in the fruit; and moisture levels. Professor Sultanbawa said this type of information was required to help understand the stability of the product, its suitability to be processed into a dehydrated powder, and to determine the type of packaging required. The toolkit has been designed to address these questions and will be tailored according to the needs of each Indigenous enterprise, depending on their current activities along the value chain. By ensuring consistently high-quality products, these enterprises are likely to get repeat, increased and new business, resulting in greater economic and social benefits delivered back into communities. Plus, the tool kit can be used to provide information on seasonality, growing conditions and plant physiology for Indigenous enterprises to own and share with future generations. The toolkit, developed by UQ s Dr Anh Phan, was also supported by funding from the Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia as part of the Australian Government s CRC program, and can be used with any native bush fruit.Djungan Paul Neal, Community Enterprise Developer at the Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council, whose community will house one of two chemistry test kits, said the kit empowered communities. We are interested in developing a commercially viable native foods industry, in partnership with industry and research organisations, that utilises traditional knowledge and science, and is led by Aboriginal people with governing intellectual property principles in place,  Mr Neal said.All the intellectual property generated in these projects will be owned by Indigenous partners.Professor Sultanbawa said the research team was investigating different sensing technologies communities could use on site to measure other key properties of their fruit, such as vitamin levels, traceability, and provenance.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Why do you get sunburn and why does autumn herald with brown leaves? These questions all have one thing in common: the interplay between dye pigments and the oxygen in the air. Every child at school gets to know this chemical reaction of  oxidation  in the air we breathe. What else is there to research? For example, the fundamentals for a microscopic understanding of the oxidation reaction, which researchers at the University of Regensburg want to get to the bottom of.Oxygen is an amazing molecule, it's magnetic. In liquid form, it can be lifted up with a magnet like iron filings. This property has something to do with the electrons in oxygen. All molecules consist of atomic nuclei and electrons, which in turn behave like tiny compass needles. Usually the compass needles of the electrons are opposite in pairs so that their magnetic forces cancel each other out. But in the oxygen molecule, which consists of two oxygen atoms, both compass needles point in the same direction and the oxygen acts magnetically.Dye molecules, on the other hand, are not magnetic because the compass needles of the electrons point in opposite directions. If light falls on such a molecule, it is absorbed at a certain color, which gives the dye its characteristic appearance. The energy of the light is transferred to an electron in the dye molecule. This cancels the pairing of any two electrons so that the electron's compass needle can spontaneously change its orientation. It cannot go back to its original state because the needles are now pointing in the same direction. This effect is a magnetic state excited by light, the so-called  triplet .The international research team led by Prof. Jascha Repp has now investigated for the first time how this  triplet energy  is transferred from a single dye molecule to a single oxygen molecule. This process is of central importance in everyday life, as many oxidation reactions take place via the excited triplet state. As long as the molecule is in this state, the energy of the absorbed light remains in the molecule. This promotes chemical reactions. For a complete de-excitation of the molecule, another reversal of the orientation of the compass needle is necessary, which is unlikely and takes a long time. Alternatively, the energy can be transferred to another magnetic molecule, oxygen. Through this transfer, the dye molecule is de-energized, but the oxygen becomes reactive and can, for example, bleach the dye. This happens with the T-shirt in the sun, but also with the pigments of the skin when sunburned.The team has now succeeded in tracking the energy transfer from dye to oxygen directly without destroying the dye. For this purpose, individual molecules were brought onto a surface at very low temperatures close to absolute zero and imaged with a so-called atomic force microscope, ie a fine needle with a single atom at its tip, which is moved over the molecule. The dye was prepared in the triplet state by means of a clever sequence of electrical pulses. The energy transfer to the oxygen can now be followed by measuring the force between the tip and the molecule over time. This spectacular breakthrough was published in the leading science magazine Science. The scientists hope to finally achieve the basis for a microscopic understanding of the oxidation reaction. In addition to the annoying fading of T-shirts, this interaction of triplet excitations in molecules also plays a central role in future-relevant technologies, for example in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells, in photocatalytic energy conversion and photosynthesis, and in photodynamic cancer therapy.In terms of method, this is a new form of microscopy that resolves both temporally and spatially, in keeping with the research concept of the new Regensburg Center for Ultrafast Nanoscopy (RUN), whose research building is currently being built on the Regensburg campus.Reference: Peng J, Sokolov S, Hernang mez-P rez D, et al.

This offers the opportunity to actually understand, in a very concrete way, how the hippocampus contributes to memory storage in the cortex,  says senior author Mark Bear, the Picower Professor of Neuroscience in the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.Essentially, the hippocampus acts to influence how images are stored in the cortex if they have a sequential relationship, says lead author Peter Finnie, a former postdoc in Bear s lab. The exciting part of this is that the visual cortex seems to be involved in encoding both very simple visual stimuli and also temporal sequences of them, and yet the hippocampus is selectively involved in how that sequence is stored,  Finnie says.","Published: July 27, 2021"

They are also much higher in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.The authors highlight that although the clinical implications of waning antibody levels are not yet clear, some decline was expected and current research shows that vaccines remain effective against severe disease. For Pfizer, antibody levels reduced from a median of 7506 U/mL at 21 41 days, to 3320 U/mL at 70 or more days. For Astra Zeneca, antibody levels reduced from a median of 1201 U/mL at 0 20 days to 190 U/mL (67 644) at 70 or more days.Dr Maddie Shrotri (UCL Institute of Health Informatics) said:  The levels of antibody following both doses of either the Astra Zeneca or Pfizer vaccine were initially very high, which is likely to be an important part of why they are so protective against severe COVID-19.   However, we found these levels dropped substantially over the course of 2 -3 months. If they carry on dropping at this rate, we are concerned that the protective effects of the vaccines may also begin to wear off, particularly against new variants; but we cannot yet predict how soon that might happen. Professor Rob Aldridge (UCL Institute of Health Informatics) explained:  When we are thinking about who should be prioritised for booster doses our data suggests that those vaccinated earliest, particularly with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, are likely to now have the lowest antibody levels.  Our findings support recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) that adults who are clinically vulnerable, those aged 70 years or over, and all residents of care homes for older adults should be prioritised for booster doses.  In addition, those who were vaccinated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, including most care home residents, are likely to have much lower antibody levels than those vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, so this may also need to be considered when deciding who should be prioritised when boosters are rolled out.  The authors note that limitations of the data include a small sample size for some groups and the fact that each individual only contributed one sample, so they cannot yet confirm how quickly antibody levels drop for each individual, or whether these would continue to drop or reach a stable level over the next few months. They also note different people will have different levels of immunity depending on the virus neutralising ability of their antibodies as well as their T-cell responses; and even when measurable antibody levels are low there is likely to be continuing immune memory that could offer long-term protection.Further research will be important to establish if there is an antibody level threshold needed for protection against severe disease.  The authors will continue to collect and analyse data from a larger number of participants, following antibody levels in individuals over a longer period of time.  Professor Andrew Hayward (UCL Epidemiology and Health Care) added:  We know vaccines are excellent at preventing severe disease, but they are not perfect, and our data suggest protection will wane over time.  With rapidly increasing COVID-19 rates and predictions of very high rates over the next weeks and months it is important that those who are clinically vulnerable, whose antibody levels may now have dropped continue to be cautious.  When we are planning vaccination programmes around the world we need to take waning immunity and the likely need for booster doses into account - with limited global vaccine supply we need to balance protecting our most vulnerable through booster doses with ensuring we play a central role in supporting global vaccination efforts.

We know that the sight of beautiful landscapes engages the brain s reward systems. But how does the brain transform visual signals into aesthetic ones? Why do we perceive a mountain vista or passing clouds as beautiful? A research team from the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics has taken up this question and investigated how our brains proceed from merely seeing a landscape to feeling its aesthetic impact. In their study, the research team presented artistic landscape videos to 24 participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they measured the participants  brain activity as they viewed and rated the videos. Their findings have just been published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. First author A. Ilkay Isik encapsulates:  We would have expected the aesthetic signals to be limited to the brain s reward systems, but surprisingly, we found them already present in visual areas of the brain while the participants were watching the videos. The activations occurred right next to brain regions deployed in recognizing physical features in movies, such as the layout of a scene or the presence of motion.  Senior author Edward Vessel suggests that these signals may reflect an early, elemental form of beauty perception: ""When we see something beyond our expectations, local patches of brain tissue generate small  atoms  of positive affect. The combination of many such surprise signals across the visual system adds up to make for an aesthetically appealing experience.  With this new knowledge, the study not only contributes to our understanding of beauty, but may also help clarify how interactions with the natural environment can affect our sense of well-being. The results might have potential applications in a variety of fields where the link between perception and emotion is important, such as clinical health care and artificial intelligence.Reference: Isik AI, Vessel EA.

Growing up in rural India, she was surrounded by great-grandmothers, great-aunts and others who far outlived the men in the family. Her family wasn t unusual. Across the world, women typically outlive men by approximately five years and experience slower rates of age-related cognitive decline.Now, as a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, Dubal is starting to uncover why those differences occur. In videos of aging mice wandering through a maze, she points out how some animals appear confused, meandering much like people trying to find their cars in a parking garage. Others take quicker, more focused routes through the maze, as if they remember exactly where they left their vehicle. Dubal recently discovered that the difference between these animals stems, in part, from a protein made by a gene on the X chromosome. Over the last several years, her research has homed in on sex chromosomes as a vital contributor to how our brains age.Two X chromosomes lead to female hormones and features, while an X and Y lead to male traits. These differences affect glucose metabolism, cellular energy production and much more, according to Dubal, an investigator with the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity and the Aging Brain.  Sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones alter fundamental biology in ways that we are just beginning to understand,  she says.  The X chromosome is 5 percent of our genome, and it has the largest density of brain-related genes compared to any individual autosome. I don t think it s coincidence that variations or human mutations in these different X factors affect brain function. Understanding these differences will be important for developing new treatments. In 2003, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) launched a program to help assess drugs or dietary interventions that could safely extend the life span of mice   and eventually humans. This Intervention Testing Program supports studies of approximately 10 to 15 treatments each year, and researchers test interventions in both male and female animals. In 2015, researchers reviewed 14 interventions that had been tested over the previous decade. They found that only five appeared to actually extend life span   and four of those worked differently in male and female animals.  That suggests there s a fundamental difference in the way we age,  said B r nice Benayoun, a biologist at the University of Southern California, in a 2020 podcast.Dubal and Benayoun are now probing the mechanisms underlying these observations, examining how steroid hormones and sex chromosomes alter the trajectory of cognitive decline with age in different sexes.* Their studies, part of an SCPAB project on sex differences in aging, will help reveal why women are on average more resilient to cognitive decline, memory loss and other brain functions that erode as we grow old. Identifying these factors could inspire interventions that benefit everyone   improving not just a person s life span but their quality of life as they age.  The things that help us live longer also tend to be the things that help us live better,  Dubal says.","Published: July 27, 2021"

Efforts must be made to eliminate barriers to increase their participation in genomic research, according to a new scientific statement from the American Heart Association, published today in the Association s journal Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine. Profound breakthroughs in genetic and genomic science are rapidly improving our ability to prevent, detect and treat cardiovascular disease,  said Gia Mudd-Martin, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.N., FAHA, associate professor of nursing at the University of Kentucky in Lexington and chair of the writing group for the scientific statement.  Conducting research in collaboration with diverse and underrepresented populations is critical to assuring equitable health benefits. Genetic research focuses on the scientific study of individual genes and their effects on health and disease, resulting in the identification of important single-gene disorders such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Genomic research, in contrast, is the study of all genes a person has (the genome) as well as how those genes interact with each other and with lifestyle behaviors (such as diet) or factors in the environment (such as air pollution). Genome-wide association studies use the genomes of multiple people to detect patterns of genomic variation associated with health or disease, such as the risk for certain heart diseases.According to the statement, about 80% of participants in genome-wide association studies are of European ancestry, yet this group represents only 16% of the global population. This limits the ability to identify genomic markers for disease risk. For example, genomic scores to determine risk for certain heart diseases are less accurate when used with ethnically and racially diverse populations or Indigenous peoples than when used with persons of European ancestry,  said Mudd-Martin.The statement highlights a need to create new, high-quality, human reference genomes representing more diverse groups of people. This means more people from diverse ethnicities and ancestry are needed to participate in medical research.  However,  said Mudd-Martin,  a key barrier to participation is a deep and understandable mistrust of scientific research caused by numerous historical transgressions against marginalized racial and ethnic groups and Indigenous populations. The most well-known cases of these are the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in Black men, during which Black men were recruited to participate in the study with the promise of free health care yet they received placebos rather than care for syphilis; and the unapproved use of tissue from Henrietta Lacks. Lacks was a Black woman who was being treated for cervical cancer and died in 1951. Without her permission, her tissue samples were used to establish the HeLa cell line, which has been a critical source of human cells for cancer, immunology, infectious disease, genomic and cardiovascular research; the HeLa cell line is still used widely in scientific research today. Unfortunately, comparable atrocities similar to what happened in the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in Black men have occurred in other marginalized racial and ethnic groups,  said Mudd-Martin,  including some that are not publicly acknowledged or disclosed. The statement offers several considerations for researchers to rebuild trust and include more diverse participants in genetic and genomic studies, including:  Engaging with communities, building trust and approaching research as a collaboration between researchers and community stakeholders are critical to support genetic and genomic research with marginalized racial and ethnic groups and Indigenous peoples. Each community is distinct, so plans to gather, use and share data will be distinct and must be developed in collaboration with each community,  Mudd-Martin said.Reference: Mudd-Martin G, Cirino AL, Barcelona V, et al.

The participants received one or two daily injections of long-acting basal insulin, with or without non-insulin medications to help lower blood sugar levels. This work wouldn t have been possible without the partnership between endocrinologists and primary care physicians, as all the patients were recruited and treated by our primary care teams,  said Busui, who is also associate director for clinical research in the Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes Institute.Aside from testing the efficacy of continuous glucose monitoring paired with basal insulin in the study participants, Busui and her team sought to better understand how the impact of this diabetes treatment approach affected patients  adherence to managing their disease as well as their overall life satisfaction.To the researchers  delight, the 175 study participants exhibited better adherence to managing their diabetes, and their life satisfaction was higher. For me, what s most exciting is that this work demonstrates that using continuous glucose monitoring is effective in substantially improving blood sugars levels and decreasing the risks of hypoglycemia in those that were randomized to use a continuous glucose monitor compared with the usual finger-prick,  said Busui. This may open the door for broader coverage of this game-changing technology for all patients with diabetes. More patients can manage their diabetes if they have access to this resource and their primary care physicians are educated on the benefits of their patients utilizing it. This future of more affordable health care already looks a little bit brighter with Medicare recently announcing eliminating the requirement of the four-time-daily finger-prick to qualify for coverage of a continuous glucose monitor.Reference: Martens T, Beck RW, Bailey R, et al.

After sitting on a quiet, warm open ocean, they snorkeled down to find a peculiar layer of murky, foul-smelling water about 10 feet below the surface, with brittle stars and sea urchins, which are usually in hiding,  perching on the tops of coral. This unique observation prompted a collaborative study explained in a new paper published today in Nature Communications analyzing what this foggy water layer is caused by, and the impact it has on life at the bottom of the seafloor.  What we re seeing are hypoxic ocean waters, meaning there is little to no oxygen in that area. All of the macro-organisms are trying to get away from this deoxygenated water, and those that cannot escape essentially suffocate. I have never seen anything like that on a coral reef,  said Johnson. There is a combination of stagnant water from low wind activity, warm water temperatures,  and nutrient pollution from nearby plantations, which contributes to a stratification of the water column. From this, we see these hypoxic conditions form that start to expand and infringe on nearby shallow habitats,  explained Johnson.Investigators suggest that loss of oxygen in the global ocean is accelerating due to climate change and excess nutrients, but how sudden deoxygenation events affect tropical marine ecosystems is poorly understood. Past research shows that rising temperatures can lead to physical alterations in coral, such as bleaching, which occurs when corals are stressed and expel algae that live within their tissues. If conditions don t improve, the bleached corals then die. However, the real-time changes caused by decreasing oxygen levels in the tropics have seldom been observed.At a local scale, hypoxic events may pose a more severe threat to coral reefs than the warming events that cause mass bleaching. These sudden events impact all oxygen-requiring marine life and can kill reef ecosystems quickly.Investigators reported coral bleaching and mass mortality due to this occurrence, causing a 50% loss of live coral, which did not show signs of recovery until a year after the event, and a drastic shift in the seafloor community. The shallowest measurement with hypoxic waters was about 9 feet deep and about 30 feet from the Bocas del Toro shore. What about the 50% of coral that survived? Johnson and her fellow investigators found that the coral community they observed in Bocas del Toro is dynamic, and some corals have the potential to withstand these conditions. This discovery sets the stage for future research to identify which coral genotypes or species have adapted to rapidly changing environments and the characteristics that help them thrive.Investigators also observed that the microorganisms living in the reefs restored to a normal state within a month, as opposed to the macro-organisms, like the brittle stars, who perished in these conditions. By collecting sea water samples and analyzing microbial DNA, they were able to conclude that these microbes did not necessarily adjust to their environment, but rather were  waiting  for their time to shine in these low-oxygen conditions. The take home message here is that you have a community of microbes; it has a particular composition and plugs along, then suddenly, all of the oxygen is removed and you get a replacement of community members. They flourish for a while, and eventually hypoxia goes away, oxygen comes back, and that community rapidly shifts back to what it was before due to the change in resources. This is very much in contrast to what you see with macro-organisms,  said Jarrod Scott, paper co-author and postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in the Republic of Panama.Scott and Johnson agree that human activity can contribute to the nutrient pollution and warming waters which then lead to hypoxic ocean conditions. Activities such as coastal land development and farming can be better managed and improved, which will reduce the likelihood of deoxygenation events occurring. The study provides insight to the fate of microbe communities on a coral reef during an acute deoxygenation event. Reef microbes respond rapidly to changes in physicochemical conditions, providing reliable indications of both physical and biological processes in nature.The shift the team detected from the hypoxic microbial community to a normal condition community after the event subsided suggests that the recovery route of reef microbes is independent and decoupled from the benthic macro-organisms. This may facilitate the restart of key microbial processes that influence the recovery of other aspects of the reef community.Reference: Johnson MD, Scott JJ, Leray M, et al.

The activity of the protein, which is found in both the brain and blood, affects neural connections in human brains and is uniquely imbalanced in people diagnosed with the condition. The research also provides guidance for future analyses into the molecular basis of this serious, disabling mental disorder.The study, an international collaboration among groups at Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan and the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Belmont, Massachusetts, was recently published in PNAS. This study examined the activity of CRMP2, a protein found in the brain (called a  cytoskeletal protein ) that regulates how neurons make connections with each other,  says Evan Y. Snyder, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine at Sanford Burnham Prebys and co-senior author of the study.  CRMP2 also happens to be expressed in lymphocytes in the blood and can therefore be readily sampled in people by doing nothing more than a simple venipuncture. There was an abundance of CRMP2 levels in samples from people with schizophrenia compared to people without the disorder. We also saw structural abnormalities in the dendrites of neurons that could potentially be disabling because dendrites play an important role in receiving impulses from other nerve cells in the brain. Previous research has shown that most people maintain an even balance between the two forms of CRMP2: its active, non-phosphorylated form and its inactive, phosphorylated form. The new research first examined postmortem brain tissue and then blood samples from people with schizophrenia. The research team compared these levels to those in people without the disorder.The findings indicated that the amount of active CRMP2 was too high in people with schizophrenia and, at least in young people with schizophrenia, was not balanced by an appropriate amount of increased inactive CRMP2. That imbalance between active and inactive CRMP2 could account for some dysfunctions in neural connections.Measuring an abundance of active CRMP2, particularly if its ratio with inactive CRMP2 is too low, could become a format for a rapid, minimally invasive blood test to support the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia can be challenging to diagnose early on or in young patients for a number of reasons,  says Snyder.  Pairing a blood test with psychiatric and neurobehavioral exams could help doctors distinguish schizophrenia from other conditions that have somewhat similar symptomologies, such as the manic phase of bipolar disorder or other behavioral, personality, or thought disorders. Our results were most striking in people under the age of 40, and even more so in people under the age of 30. An early diagnosis could improve the clinical management of affected individuals as well as accelerate the development of new therapeutic options,  Snyder adds.The researchers now want to dig deeper into the molecular biology of the disease to discover the  regulator  that keeps most people s CRMP2 levels on an even keel. They also want to conduct a larger, multi-center clinical study that compares schizophrenia with other psychiatric disorders. Future research will aim to include a wider range of ethnicities and age groups.Reference: Nomoto M, Konopaske GT, Yamashita N, et al.

They can be used to analyze digital images of tumor biopsy samples, helping physicians quickly classify the type of cancer, predict prognosis and guide a course of treatment for the patient. However, unless these algorithms are properly calibrated, they can sometimes make inaccurate or biased predictions.A new study led by researchers from the University of Chicago shows that deep learning models trained on large sets of cancer genetic and tissue histology data can easily identify the institution that submitted the images. The models, which use machine learning methods to  teach  themselves how to recognize certain cancer signatures, end up using the submitting site as a shortcut to predicting outcomes for the patient, lumping them together with other patients from the same location instead of relying on the biology of individual patients. This in turn may lead to bias and missed opportunities for treatment in patients from racial or ethnic minority groups who may be more likely to be represented in certain medical centers and already struggle with access to care. We identified a glaring hole in the in the current methodology for deep learning model development which makes certain regions and patient populations more susceptible to be included in inaccurate algorithmic predictions,  said Alexander Pearson, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at UChicago Medicine and co-senior author. The study was published July 20, in Nature Communications.One of the first steps in treatment for a cancer patient is taking a biopsy, or small tissue sample of a tumor. A very thin slice of the tumor is affixed to glass slide, which is stained with multicolored dyes for review by a pathologist to make a diagnosis. Digital images can then be created for storage and remote analysis by using a scanning microscope. While these steps are mostly standard across pathology labs, minor variations in the color or amount of stain, tissue processing techniques and in the imaging equipment can create unique signatures, like tags, on each image. These location-specific signatures aren t visible to the naked eye, but are easily detected by powerful deep learning algorithms.These algorithms have the potential to be a valuable tool for allowing physicians to quickly analyze a tumor and guide treatment options, but the introduction of this kind of bias means that the models aren t always basing their analysis on the biological signatures it sees in the images, but rather the image artifacts generated by differences between submitting sites.Pearson and his colleagues studied the performance of deep learning models trained on data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, one of the largest repositories of cancer genetic and tissue image data. These models can predict survival rates, gene expression patterns, mutations, and more from the tissue histology, but the frequency of these patient characteristics varies widely depending on which institutions submitted the images, and the model often defaults to the  easiest  way to distinguish between samples   in this case, the submitting site.For example, if Hospital A serves mostly affluent patients with more resources and better access to care, the images submitted from that hospital will generally indicate better patient outcomes and survival rates. If Hospital B serves a more disadvantaged population that struggles with access to quality care, the images that site submitted will generally predict worse outcomes.The research team found that once the models identified which institution submitted the images, they tended to use that as a stand in for other characteristics of the image, including ancestry. In other words, if the staining or imaging techniques for a slide looked like it was submitted by Hospital A, the models would predict better outcomes, whereas they would predict worse outcomes if it looked like an image from Hospital B. Conversely, if all patients in Hospital B had biological characteristics based on genetics that indicated a worse prognosis, the algorithm would link the worse outcomes to Hospital B s staining patterns instead of things it saw in the tissue. Algorithms are designed to find a signal to differentiate between images, and it does so lazily by identifying the site,  Pearson said.  We actually want to understand what biology within a tumor is more likely to predispose resistance to treatment or early metastatic disease, so we have to disentangle that site-specific digital histology signature from the true biological signal. The key to avoiding this kind of bias is to carefully consider the data used to train the models. Developers can make sure that different disease outcomes are distributed evenly across all sites used in the training data, or by isolating a certain site while training or testing the model when the distribution of outcomes is unequal. The result will produce more accurate tools that can get physicians the information they need to quickly diagnose and plan treatments for cancer patients. The promise of artificial intelligence is the ability to bring accurate and rapid precision health to more people,  Pearson said.  In order to meet the needs of the disenfranchised members of our society, however, we have to be able to develop algorithms which are competent and make relevant predictions for everyone.

A better understanding of this process may help clinicians prevent and treat organ rejection.Transplanted organs are recognized by the immune system of the recipient as foreign or non-self, which leads to rejection of the organs. Rejection is prevented or treated with drugs that suppress the immune system, mostly targeting T immune cells; however, rejection can still occur despite such treatment, not only because T cells may not be completely suppressed by the therapy, but also because of antibodies and ""natural killer cells"" that target the donor tissue.Natural killer cells play an important role in the human immune system, as they are involved in recognizing and killing harmful cells such as tumor cells. These harmful cells sometimes attempt to escape immune detection by decreasing MHC proteins, which are proteins expressed on cells that allow T cells to bind to, recognize, and tolerate itself. This mechanism renders the harmful cells invisible to T cells, but not to natural killer cells. Through their KIR receptors, natural killer cells can detect the absence of these MHC proteins and therefore kill the harmful cells. This constitutes a very important defense mechanism.In transplantation, the donor cells in the transplanted organ are not escaping immune detection by decreasing MHC expression, but these donor cells express different MHC proteins than the recipient. The natural killer cells of the recipient therefore miss the ""self"" MHC on these donor cells and become active.""This is exactly what we found in our study of 924 kidney transplantations: that the 'missing self' predicted by genetic analyses of the MHC molecules of donors and recipients, and the genetically determined KIR repertoire of the recipients, is predictive of rejection in kidney transplant biopsies,"" said senior author Maarten Naesens, MD, PhD, of KU Leuven, in Belgium. ""Therefore, our study shows that genotyping the donors and recipients not only for MHC (as is done in routine clinical practice), but also for KIR, will enable us to assess the presence or absence of 'missing self,' and improve the risk assessment of kidney transplant rejection.""Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the importance of these natural killer cells after transplantation and suggest new ways to prevent or treat kidney transplant rejection,"" added lead author Jasper Callemeyn, MD, also of KU Leuven.Reference: Callemeyn J, Senev A, Coemans M, et al. missing self induced microvascular rejection of kidney allografts: a population-based study.

The missense R273H GOF mtp53 has a mutated central DNA binding domain that renders it unable to bind specifically to DNA, but maintains the capacity to interact tightly with chromatin.Both the C-terminal domain and oligomerization domain of GOF mtp53 proteins are intact and it is unclear whether these regions of mtp53 are responsible for chromatin-based DNA replication activities.These included a frame-shift mtp53 R273Hfs387, which depleted mtp53 protein expression; mtp53 R273H 381-388, which had a small deletion within the CTD; and mtp53 R273H 347-393, which had both the OD and CTD regions truncated.The mtp53 R273H 347-393 existed exclusively as monomers and disrupted the chromatin interaction of mtp53 R273H.Taken together these Oncotarget findings show that the CTD and OD domains of mtp53 R273H play critical roles in mutant p53 GOF that pertain to processes associated with DNA replication.Dr. Jill Bargonetti said ""The p53 tumor suppressor protein is well known as a transcription factor but p53 also has transcription independent functions.""While tumor-derived missense mtp53 proteins have altered functions they contain the two N-terminal transactivation domains, followed by a proline rich domain, an altered central DNA binding domain, and the oligomerization domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain.Herein they further examine the ability of mtp53 R273H, and its OD and CTD regions, to influence cell proliferation, DNA replication, and cell cycle progression of breast cancer cells.The choice to investigate a potential role for the OD and CTD domains within the context of the mtp53 R273H allele was two-fold:They delineated the above GOF pathway in this background and in parallel with the studies reported, worked to generate more tools to elucidate the role of each domain in mtp53 GOF activity;Their pursuit of a genetic approach using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to create specific alterations within each domain necessitated that we focus first on one mtp53 R273H expressing-cell line.They saw that a frameshift mutation in C-terminal end of mtp53 reduced stable mtp53 R273H protein levels compared to the parental MDA-MB-468 cells, reduced cell proliferation, and reduced the chromatin association of replication proteins that mirrored their slow progression through S-phase.The CRISPR-Cas9 targeting also produced cell clones with C-terminal truncated mtp53 R273H proteins; such cells with truncated mtp53 R273H showed decreased proliferation as compared to the parental cells but progressed through S phase in a similar manner.The Bargonetti Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that their current studies do not point to a specific function executed by the OD and CTD domains in response to thymidine; however, they can show that their loss does not impact replisome assembly at the onset of S-phase as measured by PCNA chromatin loading and they will address this finding in the future.Thus, OD and CTD domain function(s) correlate with events post S-phase entry, in contrast with that function conferred by other p53 domain(s) deficient in the mtp53fs387 cell line, whose loss impedes S-phase entry. Although currently the authors are unable to articulate the precise roles of these distinct regions of p53 in response to thymidine, their studies suggest that they may function at temporally distinct stages of S-phase.Reference: Ellison V, Annor GK, Freedman C, et al.

The capacity of our method to identify positive cases suggests it could be an ideal first-line test for population screening,  Dr Salomon Gallo said. Our research aims to achieve rapid identification of ovarian cancer in the first and second stages of formation, which is where the current gaps in community detection are evident. In Australia, about 1500 cases of ovarian cancer were diagnosed in 2019, and more than 1000 women died of the disease known as  the silent killer .The project has received $2.7 million from the Australian Government s Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) to validate the method in a larger cohort of patients and for clinical implementation.The test developed at the UQ Centre for Clinical Research targets tiny  bubbles  produced by cells   exosomes. Exosomes essentially act as  letters , travelling long distances via the bloodstream to deliver messages to other organs,  Dr Salomon Gallo said. They have the extraordinary ability to capture a snapshot of what s going on inside the organs. By measuring these biomarkers we hope to be able to identify if women have early stage ovarian cancer through a simple blood test. Dr Salomon Gallo and fellow chief investigators from UQ, Professor Gregory Rice and Professor Sunil Lakhani, will now increase the scale of their testing.They will work with Professor Usha Menon of University College London to evaluate the test with data from the world s largest ovarian cancer screening trial. We will have access to samples taken between one and five years before the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and will determine how early our test can identify these women,  Dr Salomon Gallo said.The project also involves experts from National University Hospital, Singapore, and Australian National University.The UQ team includes Dr Andrew Lai, Professor John Hooper, Professor Lewis Perrin, Associate Professor Jim Coward, Dr Shayna Sharma and Dr Priyakshi Kalita-de-Croft.This article has been republished from the following materials.

They have hoped that this  T cell exhaustion  phenomenon could be reversed relatively easily, for example when the T cells are no longer exposed to the virus or tumor in question. Scientists now will need to take into account this limitation, including when devising immune-based therapies against chronic viral infections and cancers. Our findings suggest that once T cells become exhausted, they remain fundamentally  wired  to be exhausted thus it may be hard to get them to become effective virus- and cancer-fighters again,  said study senior author E. John Wherry, PhD, chair of the department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics and director of the Penn Institute of Immunology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.The recognition of the T cell exhaustion problem emerged about two decades ago from studies of long-term viral infections, including studies by Wherry and his laboratory. Scientists eventually concluded that long-term exposure not only to viruses but also to cancerous tumors could exhaust T cells. Exhausted T cells start producing much lower amounts of immune response-stimulating proteins, and generally become less able to kill virus-infected cells or tumor cells.Researchers have hoped that by blocking certain activity-inhibiting receptors on exhausted T cells, they could reinvigorate the T cells in cancer patients and in patients infected long-term with viruses such as HIV or Hepatitis C virus. However, there is evidence now that such reinvigoration, for example with cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors, tends to be incomplete and temporary.One question that hasn t been resolved is whether, and to what extent, exhausted T cells can recover normal functions if they no longer have exposure to the virus or tumor that exhausted them. In other words, if a person goes into long-term remission from cancer, will his or her anti-tumor T cells become un-exhausted, providing some measure of immunity against future cancer recurrence?Although exhausted T cells recovered from chronic infection (REC-TEX) regain some function and features of memory T cells (TMEM), they retain epigenetic scars indicating the control of gene expression is  locked in  to their exhaustion history.Wherry and colleagues, including first author Mohamed Abdel-Hakeem, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate in the Wherry Laboratory, addressed this question in the new study. They examined mouse T cells that had been exhausted by chronic exposure to a mouse virus called LCMV long used as a standard model of T cell-exhausting infection.The researchers found that most of the exhausted T cells died when they were no longer exposed to LCMV. The small proportion that survived recovered some of the gene expression patterns that would be expected in normal, memory-type T cells that help sustain a long-term immune defense following infection. But for the most part, the T cells remained programmed to stay in the exhausted, ineffective state, especially when called into action again upon reinfection.A cell is programmed to be in a certain state or identity by an  epigenetic  system of molecules that control which genes are active or inactive in the cell. These molecules often work by altering the structure of coiled DNA in the nucleus of the cell, making some genes more accessible to gene-copying enzymes, and others less accessible. In the study, the researchers observed that the epigenetic, DNA-structure changes that are characteristic of exhausted T cells mostly remained stable in these cells after LCMV exposure ended. Exhaustion apparently leaves durable  epigenetic scars  in T cells that constrain their ability to support an immune response. These findings point to a need to discover how to reverse that epigenetic scarring,  Wherry said.In principle, future treatments that reverse those epigenetic changes could turn exhausted T cells in patients into normal memory T cells again. Epigenetic drugs have long been a hope of cancer therapy because tumor cells also undergo epigenetic dysregulation. These drugs, however, remain somewhat unwieldly or imprecise in their effects. However, if the right epigenetic drugs can be found to modulate immune cells that could help patients fight ongoing cancers or viral infections, and could also provide patients with stronger long-term immunity following the eradication of tumors or chronic viral infections. Studies at Penn Medicine are ongoing to manipulate the epigenetics of exhausted T cells in combination with immunotherapy.Reference: Abdel-Hakeem MS, Manne S, Beltra J-C, et al.

All patients with allergic reactions to the first dose, who went on to receive a second dose, safely completed their course, with 20% reporting mild symptoms. Findings were published in JAMA Internal Medicine, July 26, 2021.US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that in exceptional situations, patients, such as those who have experienced an immediate and potentially allergic reaction to their first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may receive a single-dose Janssen viral vector vaccine instead of receiving a second dose of the mRNA vaccine. However, results of this recent study suggest that switching to a different vaccine type may not be necessary. The study, which was conducted across numerous sites in the United States from January 1 to March 31, 2021, included patients who had experienced an immediate allergic reaction to either the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine or Moderna vaccine. An immediate allergic reaction was defined as the following: symptom onset within four hours of the first vaccine dose, at least one allergic symptom and subsequent referral for an allergy/immunology consultation with in-clinic or telehealth assessment.""These reactions could include symptoms such as itching or hives or flushing. The patients included were all advised by allergy specialists after their dose one reaction,"" explained Dr. Matthew S. Krantz of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and co-lead author of the study, in a recent press release.Of the 189 patients involved in the study, 130 had experienced first-dose reactions to the Moderna vaccine and 59 to the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Thirty-two of the 130 met anaphylaxis criteria.One hundred and fifty-nine of the 189 patients received a second dose of the mRNA vaccine. Prior to the second dose being administered, some patients (n=47) received an antihistamine premedication.The authors noted that  all 159 patients, including 19 individuals with first-dose anaphylaxis, tolerated the second dose.  While twenty percent (n=32) of patients reported allergic symptoms related to the second dose, these were  self-limited, mild and/or resolved with antihistamines alone .""One important point from this study is that these immediate onset mRNA vaccine reactions may not be mechanistically caused by classic allergy, called immediate hypersensitivity or Ig-E-mediated hypersensitivity. For classic allergy, re-exposure to the allergen causes the same or even worse symptoms,"" explained co-senior author Dr. Kimberly G. Blumenthal of Massachusetts General Hospital in a press release.The authors touched on some of the study's limitations in the paper, Blumenthal elaborated further: ""The limitation of retrospective study design means that patient clinical reaction history and subsequent vaccination was not collected in a systematic fashion but rather through review of routine clinical documentation during the course of clinical care."" Because of this retrospective design, Blumenthal says that there was not a pre-determined evaluation protocol for the sites, which accounts for variations seen by site, such as a number of patients who were skin tested for polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy prior to the second dose of the vaccine, or the premedications recommended. ""There is referral bias in this study because all patients were evaluated by allergists,"" noted Blumenthal.Blumenthal shared the significance of the study's findings with Technology Networks: ""Our take-home message is that immediate allergic symptoms after [first dose of] mRNA vaccines from Pfizer or Moderna do not preclude their future use. We were able to oversee the safe complete vaccination of 159 individuals who had reactions with their first mRNA vaccine dose. Complete two-dose vaccination has become even more important with the delta variant and we suspect there are many more people who did not get their second shot because of allergic symptoms. It is important to discuss this with your doctor and consider allergist input.""The team plans to carry out additional analysis with a larger group of patients. Blumenthal explains that this would enable them ""to look at the immediate symptoms and signs to see if there are patterns that may define certain reaction phenotypes."" This could be helpful in further identifying risk factors for immediate reactions and determining the underlying mechanisms responsible.Reference: Krantz MS, Kwah JH, Stone CA, et al.

It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough so that loaves and rolls can be baked into different shapes while remaining flexible and crusty. It also lengthens the shelf life of bread at room temperature, when associated with preservatives.Gluten intolerance, however, has become a global epidemic, and gluten-free products are increasingly popular. The problem is that most of those available on the market are far from corresponding to consumers  expectations in terms of appearance, aroma, flavor and durability. A research line focusing on ways to enhance gluten-free products is being pursued in Brazil by nutritionist Vanessa Dias Capriles, a professor at the Federal University of S o Paulo (UNIFESP) in Santos.Her work is supported by FAPESP via Young Investigator and Multiuser Equipment grants. The research has resulted so far in 14 articles in scientific journals. The latest is published in Foods. Three conditions are currently recognized as grounds for prescribing a gluten-free diet: celiac disease, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is a chronic dysfunction of genetic origin that affects 1.4% of the world population and can lead to multisystem disorders, with severe complications when left untreated. Wheat allergy is an immune reaction to the proteins in wheat. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a condition that can be caused by gluten or other components of wheat such as rapidly fermentable carbohydrates. Unlike celiac disease, it isn t an autoimmune condition, and its symptoms, albeit often similar, aren t associated with such severe complications,  Capriles told Ag ncia FAPESP.To meet demand from people with these conditions, but also from a much larger number of consumers who, for health-related or faddish reasons, want to eliminate gluten from their diet completely or partially, the volume of gluten-free products available is growing spectacularly and they are fast becoming a global trend instead of a niche market. However, the development of these products is a major technological challenge,  Capriles said.  Bread made with wheat flour has been an important human food for millennia. The sense impressions it causes are deeply ingrained in people s lifestyle. That s why it s important to develop enhanced versions of these products. Market research shows that consumers are dissatisfied with the appearance, aroma, variety and convenience of the products currently available. Besides deficient sensory quality, gluten-free bread is often nutritionally poor.  Generally speaking, it s made with refined starch such as rice bran combined with corn, potato and cassava starch,  she said.  It contains little fiber, proteins, vitamins or minerals, and relatively large amounts of fat. It s not enriched with micronutrients in many countries. The research under way at UNIFESP has three goals: improving the overall nutritional value of gluten-free products, increasing their acceptability to consumers, and seeking technologically feasible solutions. We ve obtained more than 15 formulations we consider optimal, using different techniques to create and optimize these products. They contain 50%-100% gluten-free wholemeal flour, and as a result, they contain a large proportion of fiber, with more proteins, vitamins and minerals,  Capriles said.  Qualitative consumer surveys show our gluten-free wholemeal bread products achieve comparable acceptability to bread made with regular wheat flour. The group researched different raw materials, including wholemeal flour from cereals such as rice, sorghum and millet; pseudo-cereals such as amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat; and others such as chickpeas, dry beans and pine nuts.To increase the fiber content, they tried using psyllium, with positive results. Psyllium is a fibrous material made from husks of the seeds of the plant Plantago ovata. Every 100 grams supply 80 grams of soluble fiber. It is hygroscopic and expands to form a gelatinous mass when mixed with water. It is popular among consumers who are looking for functional foods and is often recommended to help treat constipation, diabetes and atherosclerosis. We succeeded in producing bread with 17% psyllium. Because it absorbs water, dough made with psyllium can be molded into many shapes, just like rolls and loaves made with conventional wheat flour,  Capriles said.  In more recent studies, we associated psyllium with chickpea flour and obtained surprisingly good results. Besides high acceptability and nutritiousness, its advantages include a low glycemic response [it does not raise blood sugar significantly] and heightened satiety in healthy people. Another very interesting point is that it maintained its acceptability even after being stored at room temperature for seven days. Next steps include finding partners in industry to transfer the technology to, she added, as well as moving ahead with the research and development on a collaborative basis.Reference: Fratelli C, Santos FG, Muniz DG, Habu S, Braga ARC, Capriles VD.

The results of a new IIASA-led study can be used to benchmark global food security projections and inform policy analysis and public debate on the future of food.Despite the fact that food supply has increased dramatically since the 1960s, the question of how to eradicate global hunger - one of the Sustainable Development Goals - and feed the growing world population in years to come, remains a major challenge. Climate change and increasing competition for land and water are further exacerbating the problem, making the need for effective policies to ensure global food security and a better understanding of the main driving forces of global hunger ever more urgent.Scientists typically use quantified global scenarios and projections to assess long-term future global food security under a range of socioeconomic and climate change scenarios. However, due to differences in model design and scenario assumptions, there is uncertainty about the range of food security projections and outcomes. To address this uncertainty, IIASA guest researcher Michiel van Dijk and colleagues conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to assess the range of future global food security projections to 2050. Their study, which has been published in the journal Nature Food, focused on two key food security indicators: future food demand, which is a key driver of a required increase in food production, and associated impacts on land use change, biodiversity and climate change, and population at risk of hunger - an indicator of the number of people that face chronic food insecurity.""Our study aimed to determine the range of future global food demand and population at risk of hunger projections to 2050. To answer this question, we analyzed 57 studies published between 2000 and 2018. We harmonized all projections and mapped them into the five highly divergent but plausible socioeconomic futures, including sustainable, business-as-usual, divided world, inequality, and conventional development scenarios,"" van Dijk explains.The study's findings provide strong support for the view that food demand will increase by between 35% and 56% over the period 2010-2050, mainly due to population growth, economic development, urbanization, and other drivers. If climate change is taken into account, the range changes slightly, but overall with no statistical differences. Although less dramatic than the need to double current production as commonly stated in many other studies, the increase in demand may still have negative impacts on the environment and lead to biodiversity loss. In order to prevent such impacts, increases in food production would need to be accompanied by policies and investments that promote sustainable intensification and incorporate ecological principles in agricultural systems and practices, while also reducing food loss and waste and encouraging a shift towards more plant-based diets.In the most negative scenarios, the population at risk of hunger is expected to increase by 8% (30% when the impact of climate change is considered) over the 2010-2050 period, which implies that the Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger and achieving food security will not be achieved. To prevent this, the researchers urge policymakers to work proactively to develop adequate long-term measures, including stimulating inclusive growth.""Our study can fuel the public debate on the future of food by inviting every citizen to imagine and discuss a wider range of food future scenarios, rather than just a binary choice between business-as-usual and the universal adoption of organic agriculture or vegan diets. To think responsibility and creatively about the future, we need to envision multiple plausible scenarios and evaluate their consequences,"" notes study co-author Yashar Saghai, a researcher at the University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands.Although the study did not explicitly investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers say that it is plausible that their range also includes the now more likely negative COVID-induced futures that are associated with an increase in the population at risk of hunger, instead of a decrease of around 50% that was considered the pre-COVID business-as-usual.""While it is too early to oversee and understand the full impact and consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, current developments show some resemblance to the most negative archetype scenarios in our analysis, which is characterized by slow economic development, a focus on domestic security and national sovereignty, and increasing inequality. This implies a potential significant increase in the number of population at risk of hunger between 2010 and 2050 in the worst case. Recent developments, underscore the need for (quantitative) scenario analysis and comparison as a tool to inform policy analysis, coordination, and planning for the future of food as well as wider societal issues,"" van Dijk concludes.Reference: van Dijk M, Morley T, Rau ML, Saghai Y.

These tests are mainly based on finding mutated DNA, shed by tumour cells when they die, known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA).However, detecting brain tumour cfDNA in the blood has historically been difficult because of the blood-brain-barrier, which separates blood from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, preventing the passage of cells and other particles, such as cfDNA.Researchers have previously looked at detecting cfDNA in CSF, but the spinal taps needed to obtain it can be dangerous for people with brain tumours so are not appropriate for patient monitoring.Scientists have known that cfDNA with similar mutations to the original tumour can be found in blood and other bodily fluids such as urine in very low levels, but the challenge has been developing a test sensitive enough to detect these specific mutations.The researchers, led by Dr Florent Mouliere who is based at the Rosenfeld Lab of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and at the Amsterdam UMC, and Dr Richard Mair, who is based at Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and the University of Cambridge developed two approaches in parallel to overcome the challenge of detecting brain tumour cfDNA.The first approach works for patients who have previously had glioma removed and biopsied. The team designed a tumour-guided sequencing test that was able to look for the mutations found in the tumour tissue within the cfDNA in the patient s urine, CSF, and blood plasma.A total of eight patients who had suspected brain tumours based on MRIs were included in this part of the study. Samples were taken at their initial brain tumour biopsies, alongside CSF, blood and urine samples.By knowing where in the DNA strand to look, the researchers found that it was possible to find mutations even in the tiny amounts of cfDNA found in the blood plasma and urine.The test was able to detect cfDNA in 7 out of 8 CSF samples, 10 out of the 12 plasma blood samples and 10 out of the 16 urine samples.For the second approach the researchers looked for other patterns in the cfDNA that could also indicate the presence of a tumour, without having to identify the mutations.They analysed 35 samples from glioma patients, 27 people with non-malignant brain disorders, and 26 healthy people. They used whole genome sequencing, where all the cfDNA of the tumour is analysed, not just the mutations.They found in the blood plasma and urine samples that fragments of cfDNA, which came from patients with brain tumours were different sizes than those from patients with no tumours in CSF. They then fed this data into a machine learning algorithm which was able to successfully differentiate between the urine samples of people with and without glioma.The researchers say that while the machine learning test is cheaper and easier, and a tissue biopsy from the tumour is not needed, it is not as sensitive and is less specific than the first tumour-guided sequencing approach.MRIs are not invasive or expensive, but they do require a trip to the hospital, and the three-month gap between checks can be a regular source of anxiety for patients.The researchers suggest that their tests could be used between MRI scans, and could ultimately be able to detect a returning brain tumour earlier.The next stage of this research will see the team comparing both tests against MRI scans in a trial with patients with brain tumours who are in remission to see if it can detect if their tumours are coming back at the same time or earlier than the MRI. If the tests prove that they can detect brain tumours earlier than an MRI, then the researchers will look at how they can adapt the tests so they could be offered in the clinic, which could be within the next ten years. We believe the tests we ve developed could in the future be able to detect a returning glioma earlier and improve patient outcomes,  said Mair.  Talking to my patients, I know the three-month scan becomes a focal point for worry. If we could offer a regular blood or urine test, not only will you be picking up recurrence earlier, you can also be doing something positive for the patient s mental health. Michelle Mitchell, Chief Executive of Cancer Research UK said,  While this is early research, it s opened up the possibility that within the next decade we could be able to detect the presence of a brain tumour with a simple urine or blood test. Liquid biopsies are a huge area of research interest right now because of the opportunities they create for improved patient care and early diagnosis. It s great to see Cancer Research UK researchers making strides in this important field. Sue Humphreys, from Wallsall, a brain tumour patient, said: ""If these tests are found to be as accurate as the standard MRI for monitoring brain tumours, it could be life changing.If patients can be given a regular and simple test by their GP, it may help not only detect a returning brain tumour in its earliest stages, it can also provide the quick reassurance that nothing is going on which is the main problem we all suffer from, the dreaded Scanxiety.The problem with three-monthly scans is that these procedures can get disrupted by other things going on, such as what we have seen with the Covid pandemic. As a patient, this causes worry as there is a risk that things may be missed, or delayed, and early intervention is the key to any successful treatment.

This uncovered an unexpected role for immune T cells in protection against malaria, a finding that could help to improve the development of much-needed malaria vaccines.The research, which was published in the journal JCI Insight was led by WEHI's Dr Lisa Ioannidis and Associate Professor Diana Hansen, in collaboration with Professor Ric Price from the Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin, and Dr Rintis Noviyanti from the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Indonesia.At a glanceAdvanced technologies have revealed 'immune signatures' that differentiate immune responses that drive symptomatic or asymptomatic Plasmodium vivax malaria infections.The international collaboration revealed a previously unrecognised role for immune CD4 T cells in preventing serious disease and controlling asymptomatic infection of low parasite burden.The findings could guide to the development of better vaccines against malaria, a disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world each year.Variable immune responsesMalaria is a parasitic disease impacting hundreds of millions of people each year. After infection, people develop immunity to the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria - but this immunity only reduces the disease severity rather than preventing infection altogether. Despite the immense global impact of malaria, there are not yet vaccines in clinical use to prevent this disease.The immune response to malaria is a 'double-edged sword', Associate Professor Hansen said. ""While an immune response to the parasite can prevent severe disease, in some people it is an excessive immune response - driving severe inflammation - that exacerbates malaria, causing the most severe, and potentially fatal, symptoms,"" she said.""Our research has investigated the longstanding question of how immune responses differ between people with symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections. We focussed on the Plasmodium vivax form of malaria, which is most common in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America. This species is a particular challenge to control as infected people can carry it for many months in the liver without symptoms.""Using the University of Melbourne's mass cytometry facility, the research team were able to undertake in-depth, multi-dimensional assessments of the immune cells in blood samples provided by people living in a vivax malaria-endemic region of Indonesia. Dr Ioannidis said the team compared many aspects of immunity in samples from people who were uninfected, asymptomatically infected, or symptomatically infected with P. vivax.""In collaboration with a WEHI bioinformatics team led by Professor Gordon Smyth, we used machine learning to develop an 'immune signature' that distinguised between these three categories of samples. These signatures could be applied to new blood samples from people infected with malaria, to accurately predict the severity of their infection,"" Dr Ioannidis said.Enhancing malaria controlDr Ioannidis said the immune signatures revealed the key components of the immune response that drive immunity to malaria. ""Antibodies produced by B cells were one important component, especially in people with high parasite loads and symptomatic disease, but we also discovered that certain types of CD4 T cells were critical to keep infections in check, preventing symptoms,"" she said.""This is the first time CD4 T cells have been shown to be important for controlling asymptomatic P. vivax infections.""Associate Professor Hansen said the discovery could lead to better approaches to controlling - or even eliminating - malaria. ""Malaria vaccine development has focussed almost entirely on measuring antibody responses as a marker of vaccine success. Our research has revealed the important role of CD4 T cells in controlling malaria infections - and we think these cells need much more consideration when designing malaria vaccines. Because vivax malaria can persist in asymptomatic people, it is critical that vaccines activate CD4 T cells to control these low-grade infections,"" Associate Professor Hansen said.Reference: Ioannidis LJ, Pietrzak HM, Ly A, et al.

One mechanism of action. Two biologically opposite effects. It s conceptually unexpected and interesting for a protein to switch biological functions without actually changing what it s doing,  said David Cortez, PhD, professor and chair of Biochemistry, of his team s recent discoveries about the protein RADX.Cortez, who holds the Richard N. Armstrong, PhD Chair for Innovation in Biochemistry, and his colleagues first identified RADX several years ago and linked it to a process cells use during DNA replication to respond to sites of damage. Now, in two papers published recently in Molecular Cell, the researchers have clarified what RADX does and how it does it.RADX works at sites of DNA synthesis, called replication forks, where Cortez s team previously found that it regulates a process called  fork reversal.  Fork reversal happens when the DNA replication machinery encounters a problem and backs up   like a train might if something was blocking the track. When there are DNA lesions or any trouble during replication, which happens during every cell division cycle, fork reversal is one way that the cell uses to respond to that damage,  Cortez said. But when there aren t lesions, replication forks shouldn t stop or reverse.In studies led by postdoctoral fellow Madison Adolph, PhD, and graduate student Archana Krishnamoorthy, the researchers have now discovered that RADX has different effects on replication forks, depending on the conditions of the  track.  In unstressed cells (no lesions or trouble), RADX prevents fork reversal; in stressed cells, it promotes fork reversal. RADX makes sure the train stops and backs up   the forks reverse   only when they re supposed to,  Cortez said.The new discovery overturned parts of the models that the Cortez team had previously developed to describe RADX function. The earlier models were right about RADX preventing fork reversal, Cortez said, but it took a conceptual leap to understand that the same protein could both prevent and promote fork reversal, depending on the cellular conditions.Cortez praised Adolph and Krishnamoorthy for continuously questioning the models that the lab had proposed. They weren t afraid to keep testing the models and to overturn the dogma that our lab had created,  he said.  Our data was all right, but we had to revise our interpretation of it. That s what science is all about. The researchers discovered the mechanistic details of how RADX works by binding to another protein called RAD51, which is required at carefully controlled levels to cause fork reversal. The complex process is fundamental to DNA replication and cell division. In every cell division cycle in every organism on the planet, DNA synthesis has to start and finish,  Cortez said.  If it doesn t do it correctly, it causes mutations that can result in cancer, developmental disorders, and all kinds of problems. The cell has layer upon layer of regulation because DNA synthesis is so important. RADX is one of those layers. It s fine tuning this whole interesting mechanism of fork reversal to make sure it happens only when it s supposed to, so that DNA synthesis is complete and accurate. The new findings also add to the group s previous discovery that RADX plays a role in the sensitivity of cells to cancer chemotherapies. RADX and BRCA2 (the protein encoded by a gene associated with risk for breast and ovarian cancer) compete for binding to the same site on RAD51, Cortez said.  Our in vitro data show that RADX influences responses to therapy, but we don t know what happens in patients. There s a lot still to be learned.

UVA s discovery identifies a potential avenue, one inspired by the brain s natural immune response.Using high-powered imaging, the researchers were able to see, for the first time, that immune cells called microglia were not just removing damaged material after experimental seizures but actually appeared to be healing damaged neurons. There has been mounting generic support for the idea that microglia could be used to ameliorate seizures, but direct, visualized evidence for how they could do this has been lacking,  said researcher Ukpong B. Eyo, PhD, of UVA s Department of Neuroscience, the UVA Brain Institute and UVA s Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG).  Our results indicate that microglia may not be simply clearing debris but providing structural support for neuronal integrity that may have implications even beyond the scope of seizures and epilepsy.  The new findings come from a collaboration of scientists at UVA, Mayo Clinic and Rutgers University. They used an advanced imaging technique called two-photon microscopy to examine what happened in the brains of lab mice after severe seizures. What they saw was strange and unexpected.Rather than simply cleaning up debris, the microglia began forming pouches. These pouches didn t swallow up damaged material, as many immune cells do. Instead, they began tending to swollen dendrites   the branches of nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses. They weren t removing, the scientists realized; they appeared to be healing.These odd little pouches   the scientists named them  microglial process pouches    stuck around for hours. They often shrank, but they were clearly doing something beneficial because the dendrites they targeted ended up looking better and healthier than those they didn t. We did not find microglia to be  eating  the neuronal elements in this context,  Eyo said.  Rather, we saw a strong correlation between these interactions and a structural resolution of injured neurons suggestive of a healing  process. The new insights into the brain s immune response points scientists in promising new directions.  Although these findings are exciting, there is yet a lot to follow-up on them. For example, the precise mechanisms that regulate the interactions remain to be identified. Moreover, at present, the healing feature is suggested from correlational results and more definitive studies are required to certify the nature of the healing,  Eyo said.  If these questions can be answered, they will provide a rationale for developing approaches to enhance this process   in seizure contexts. Eyo has already received two grants totaling almost $5 million from the National Institutes of Health to continue his study of microglia. The funding will allow him to study how the immune cells help regulate vascular function, which could be important in diseases such as Alzheimer s, and their role in brain-hyperactivity disorders such as febrile seizures that can trigger epilepsy. With this new funding, we are eager to clarify roles for microglia in seizure disorders and vascular function,  he said.  UVA s continued investment is neuroscience research provides a suitable home for our lab s research. Reference: Eyo UB, Haruwaka K, Mo M, et al.

The proposed lunar design could be deployed on multiple spaceflight platforms, including lunar surface landers and robotic rovers, as well as a handheld tool suitable for operation by future astronauts.""The last mass spectrometer deployed to the lunar surface was the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment (LACE) deployed in December 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission,"" said SwRI's Edward Patrick, ENABLE principal investigator. ""With ENABLE, we are starting with a successful commercial design capable of conducting diagnostics from atmospheric pressure down to ultra-high vacuum (UHV).""Nearly half a century after Apollo, NASA lunar missions such as the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer have conducted remote sensing to search for trapped volatiles, chemical substances that can be readily vaporized.

In a new paper and with a new grant from the National Institutes of Health, an MIT neuroscience lab is making the case that the LC is not just an alarm button but has a more nuanced and multifaceted impact on learning, behavior and mental health than it has been given credit for.With inputs from more than 100 other brain regions and sophisticated control of where and when it sends out norepinephrine (NE), the LC's tiny population of surprisingly diverse cells may represent an important regulator of learning from reward and punishment, and then applying that experience to optimize behavior, said Mriganka Sur, Newton Professor of Neuroscience in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.""What was formerly considered a homogenous nucleus exerting global, uniform influence over its many diverse target regions, is now suggested to be a heterogeneous population of NE-releasing cells, potentially exhibiting both spatial and temporal modularity that govern its functions,"" wrote Sur, postdoc Vincent Breton-Provencher and graduate student Gabrielle Drummond in a review article published last month in Frontiers in Neural Circuits.The article presents copious emerging evidence from Sur's group and many others, suggesting that the LC may integrate sensory inputs and internal cognitive states from across the brain to precisely exert its NE-mediated influence to affect actions - by throttling NE to the motor cortex - and the processing of resulting feedback of reward or punishment - by throttling NE to the prefrontal cortex.To investigate that hypothesis, the team has begun working with a $2.1 million, 5-year NIH grant awarded in April. In this study they are engaging mice in learning tasks where they are cued by tones of varying pitches and volumes. Over the course of training the mice will learn that when a tone is high pitched, pressing a lever will yield a reward and when the tone is low pitched, the correct response would be to not push lest it experience an unpleasant air puff. By varying the tone volume, the experimenters will vary the certainty the mice can feel that they heard the cue correctly.The hypothesis (borne out by preliminary data) predicts that the NE will matter in multiple crucial ways, Sur said. When the mouse hears the cue tone, if the pitch is low the LC would send less NE via a cadre of neurons to the motor cortex, reflecting the animal's belief that the lever should not be pushed because no reward will be forthcoming. Meanwhile the lower the volume, the less certainty the animal has in its decision. Conversely, a high tone of high volume would send more NE, reflecting the animal's certainty that pushing the lever would produce a reward.After the mouse has acted, the more surprising the feedback, the more NE it will produce and send via a distinct group to the prefrontal cortex, stimulating greater learning. So for instance, if the mouse hears a faint, high tone and gingerly presses the lever, the surprise of a resulting reward will stimulate a strong output of NE to instruct the prefrontal cortex because its expectations weren't very high. Whenever a mouse guesses wrong and feels an air puff, that will stimulate the strongest NE release to the prefrontal cortex. After such dynamics, Sur's team has observed consistent performance changes on the subsequent trial.""This is a way by which norepinephrine can be thought of as an arousal signal, but it's also, importantly, in the context of ongoing function a learning signal,"" Sur said. ""It is both an execution signal and a learning signal, for both of which we can describe the actual quantitative relationships.""Not only will the team be measuring the activity of LC-NE neurons, they'll also take them over using optogenetics (in which neurons can be controlled with light), so that they can silence or amplify LC-NE output to show how doing each affects action and learning.Understanding the true nature of how the LC works could be useful for improving treatments for certain disorders, Sur said. A potential treatment for PTSD, for instance, involves damping receptiveness to NE, but that also promotes drowsiness. A more principled and precise treatment could improve efficacy and reduce those side effects, he said.""The hope is to affect the anxiety but not make you sleepy, if we understand the targets and theory behind it,"" Sur said. ""That is the hope of basic science for treating disorders--to make things more and more specific, to define the circuits and the specificity of functions that a system is involved in.""Moreover the LC is an early region affected in Alzheimer's disease, he said. Addressing that loss in the right way could help sustain forms of learning and cognition.Reference: Breton-Provencher V, Drummond GT, Sur M.

""Advantages of intranasal vaccines include needle-free administration, delivery of antigen to the site of infection, and the elicitation of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract.""Their viewpoint article goes on to detail the individual advantages and challenges of each of the seven intranasal vaccine candidates. Six are viral vectors, including three different adenovirus vectors, and one candidate each for live-attenuated influenza virus, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus and live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2. The seventh vaccine candidate is an inert protein subunit.Among the drawbacks of using viruses that people may have encountered before is negative interference from anti-vector antibodies that impair vaccine delivery. And because of the minimal risk of reversion for the live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 virus, it would likely be contraindicated for infants, people over 49 and immunocompromised persons.""Notably absent from the list of intranasal vaccines are those formulated as lipid-encapsulated mRNA,"" Lund and Randall said, listing some of the challenges and adverse side effects that accompany that approach.""Ultimately, the goal of vaccination is to elicit long-lived protective immunity,"" the UAB researchers concluded. Comparing the benefits and disadvantages of intranasal vaccination against intramuscular vaccinations, they suggest that perhaps effective vaccination need not be restricted to a single route.""The ideal vaccination strategy,"" the immunologists concluded, ""may use an intramuscular vaccine to elicit a long-lived systemic immunoglobulin G response and a broad repertoire of central memory B and T cells, followed by an intranasal booster that recruits memory B and T cells to the nasal passages and further guides their differentiation toward mucosal protection, including immunoglobulin A secretion and tissue-resident memory cells in the respiratory tract.""Reference: Lund FE, Randall TD.

A new study in the journal Cell suggests that the first responses in this battleground help determine who will develop severe disease and who will get through with mild or no illness.Building on work published last year identifying cells susceptible to the virus, a team of collaborators at Boston Children s Hospital, MIT, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center comprehensively mapped SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasopharynx. They obtained samples from the nasal swabs of 35 adults with COVID-19 from April to September 2020, ranging from mildly symptomatic to critically ill. They also got swabs from 17 control subjects and six patients who were intubated but did not have COVID-19. Why some people get more sick than others has been one of the most puzzling aspects of this virus from the beginning,  says Jos  Ordov s-Monta s, PhD, of Boston Children s, co-senior investigator on the study with Bruce Horwitz, MD, PhD of Boston Children s, Alex Shalek, PhD, of MIT and Sarah Glover, DO, of the University of Mississippi.  Many studies looking for risk predictors have looked for signatures in the blood, but blood may not really be the right place to look.  To get a detailed picture of what happens in the nasopharynx, the researchers sequenced the RNA in each cell, one cell at a time. (For a sense of all the work this entailed, each patient swab yielded an average of 562 cells.) The RNA data enabled the team to pinpoint which cells were present, which contained RNA originating from the virus   an indication of infection   and which genes the cells were turning on and off in response.It soon became clear that the epithelial cells lining the nose and throat undergo major changes in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The cells diversified in type overall. There was an increase in mucus-producing secretory and goblet cells. At the same time, there was a striking loss of mature ciliated cells, which sweep the airways, together with an increase in immature ciliated cells (which were perhaps trying to compensate).The team found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a diverse range of cell types, including immature ciliated cells and specific subtypes of secretory cells, goblet cells, and squamous cells. The infected cells, as compared with uninfected  bystander  cells, had more genes turned on that are involved in a productive response to infection. The key finding came when the team compared nasopharyngeal swabs from people with different severity of COVID-19 illness:  Everyone with severe COVID-19 had a blunted interferon response early on in their epithelial cells, and were never able to ramp up a defense,  says Ordov s-Monta s.  Having the right amount of interferon at the right time could be at the crux of dealing with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.  As a next step, the researchers plan to investigate what is causing the muted interferon response in the nasopharynx, which evidence suggests may also occur with the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. They will also explore the possibility of augmenting the interferon response in people with early COVID-19 infections, perhaps with a nasal spray or drops.

This particular area of Texas was selected because of the heightened prevalence of childhood asthma in the region, as well as a higher prematurity rate (14.8 percent) compared to the rest of the state (12.9 percent).The study was aimed at quantifying maternal PAH exposure in pregnant women residing in McAllen. To gather the data, participants carried backpacks containing air-sampling equipment. A silicone wristband was also attached to each backpack. After three nonconsecutive 24-hour periods, the air-sampling equipment and wristbands were analyzed for PAHs. Prenatal exposure to PAHs has been shown to lead to adverse health effects in children.When the researchers analyzed and compared the data from the air sampling equipment and the wristbands, they found that the wristbands yielded similar results to the more traditional testing methods. The researchers suggest that the use of the silicone wristbands as a passive sampler could be useful in studies of semi-volatile PAHs.""The use of wristbands is appealing because it is inexpensive and easy to wear,"" said co-author Itza Mendoza-Sanchez, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health (EOH). ""Wristbands have been used to detect a number of pollutant, but qualification of those pollutants remains a challenge. Our goal was to evaluate to what extent we can use wristbands as passive samplers to quantify PAHs in air.""We found that patterns of detection are similar for low-molecular weight compounds and that attaching the wristbands to the backpack's strap is a good sampling design for evaluating conditions under which wristbands could be used for quantifying PAHs in air.""Mendoza-Sanchez co-authored the study with Inyang Uwak, a recent Doctor of Public Health graduate. It was part of a larger maternal environmental health study led by Associate Professor Natalie Johnson and Associate Professor Dr. Genny Carrillo. Former EOH students Louise Myatt, Kristal A. Rychlik, Jairus C. Pulczinski, and Allison Van Cleve also took part in the research.""Maternal exposure to PAHs during pregnancy is particularly harmful to children's health since this is a phase of rapid human growth and development,"" Johnson said. ""Thus, easy methods to quantify PAH exposure are of critical need in order to evaluate risk and develop effective intervention strategies.""Johnson said the results of the study support that wristbands used as passive samplers may be helpful in future studies evaluating adverse health outcomes from prenatal PAH exposure.Reference: Mendoza-Sanchez I, Uwak I, Myatt L, et al.

A major component of hearing impairment is difficulty hearing speech in noisy environments (speech-in-noise hearing impairment). This can have a large impact on the day-to-day functioning of affected individuals who can struggle to follow conversations or hear announcements in noisy environments. However, until now it was unclear whether difficulty hearing speech-in-noise was associated with developing dementia.This has now been robustly investigated in a new study led by the University of Oxford s Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH) published today in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. The study involved over 82,000 women and men aged 60 years or older from UK Biobank. At the beginning of the study, participants were asked to identify spoken numbers against a background of white noise and based on this test were grouped by the researchers into normal, insufficient and poor speech-in-noise hearing. Dr Thomas Littlejohns, senior epidemiologist in the Nuffield Department of Population Health(NDPH), and senior author of the study, said:  Dementia affects millions of individuals worldwide, with the number of cases projected to treble in the next few decades. However, there is growing evidence that developing dementia is not inevitable and that the risk could be reduced by treating pre-existing conditions. Whilst preliminary, these results suggest speech-in-noise hearing impairment could represent a promising target for dementia prevention. Dr Jonathan Stevenson (former MSc student at NDPH and current Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery trainee with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons), lead author for the study, said:  Difficulty hearing speech in background noise is one of the most common problems for people with age-related hearing impairment. This is the first study to investigate its association with dementia in a large population. It has been suggested that hearing impairment could lead to increased social isolation or depression, and that it is these factors that increase the risk of dementia. However, the study found little evidence that this was the case.The study found that the risk of dementia remained similar when restricting the analysis to dementia which developed after nine years as well as within three years. This was explored as there is speculation that pre-diagnosed dementia could be driving the association between hearing loss and dementia. If this was the case, then an increased risk within three years but less so after nine years would be expected.Dr Katy Stubbs from Alzheimer s Research UK, said:  While most people think of memory problems when we hear the word dementia, this is far from the whole story. Many people with dementia will experience difficultly following speech in a noisy environment   a symptom sometimes called the  cocktail party problem . This study suggests that these hearing changes may not just be a symptom of dementia, but a risk factor that could potentially be treated. Large studies like the UK Biobank are powerful tools for identifying genetic, health and lifestyle factors linked to conditions like dementia, but it is always difficult to tease apart cause and effect in this type of research. Anyone who has concerns about their hearing should speak to their GP. Reference: Stevenson JS, Clifton L, Ku ma E, Littlejohns TJ.

The research found a significant proportion of the rugby players had signs of abnormalities to the white matter, in addition to abnormal changes in white matter volume over time.White matter is the  wiring  of the brain, and helps brain cells communicate with each other. The research team say more work is now needed to investigate the long-term effects of professional rugby on brain health.Professor David Sharp, senior author from Imperial s Department of Brain Sciences, said:  Despite relatively high rates of head injury and an increasing focus on prevention, there has been relatively little research investigating the long-term effects of rugby participation. More objective measures of the effects of sporting head injuries on the brain are needed to assist with the assessment and management of individual players. Our research using advanced magnetic resonance imaging suggests that professional rugby participation can be associated with structural changes in the brain that may be missed using conventional brain scans. What is not clear at this stage is the long-term clinical impact of these changes. Further research is needed to understand the long-term implications of repeated head injuries experienced during a rugby career and to provide more accurate ways to assess risk for an individual. The work, in collaboration with University College London, was funded and instigated by The Drake Foundation, who brought together academia and sport for this pioneering study, and was additionally supported by the National Institute for Health Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, the UK Dementia Research Institute and the Rugby Football Union. Lauren Pulling, The Drake Foundation s CEO, said:  The Drake Foundation would like to thank the RFU, rugby clubs and research team for their support in this vital study. At present, the long-term consequences of these brain structure abnormalities are unknown and require further research. However, taken together with existing evidence across different sports, as well as recent cases of rugby players being diagnosed with brain diseases in their 40s, they are painting a concerning picture when it comes to players  long-term brain health. The study, which took place between July 2017 and September 2019, assessed 41 male players, and three female.All underwent a type of brain scan called an MRI, and around half then had a second MRI scan a year later. The study used two advanced types of MRI called susceptibility weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. This allowed them to look at the structure of blood vessels and the white matter.The study is the first to assess long-term changes in MRI images of professional rugby players.The rugby players were compared to athletes in non-collision sports, as well as individuals who were not athletes.Among the group of rugby players, 21 were assessed shortly after sustaining a mild head injury, called a mild traumatic brain injury. In professional rugby union in England, these types of head injuries, which often cause concussions, are the most common reported match injury   accounting for one in five injuries.The scientists analysed the brain scans for changes in the white matter of the brain, and compared these to the athletes in non-collision sports, and the non-athletes.The results revealed that 23 percent of all of the rugby players showed abnormalities to their cell axons (the  wires  of brain cells), or small tears in blood vessels. These tears cause small leaks in the brain, called microbleeds.These changes were seen in both players with and without a recent head injury. In addition, the scans provide evidence for unexpected changes in white matter volume across the whole group of rugby players. These could indicate a longer-term effect of these abnormalities to connections in the brain. However, further research is needed to understand the significance of these changes in brain structure.The research team also asked the players to complete assessments, such as memory tests, to analyse their brain function. The results revealed players with abnormalities in their brain structures did not perform worse than players without abnormalities.The study team add that long-term studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects on brain health. They add that other health benefits of sports participation must also be taken into account when assessing impact on the brain health.Mr Karl Zimmerman, lead author of the research, from Imperial s Department of Brain Sciences, said:  The implications on an individual level of the brain changes associated with elite rugby participation are unclear, although obviously it is concerning to see these changes in some of the players  brains. It is important to note that our results in adult professional rugby union and league players are not directly comparable to those who play at local or youth levels. The overall health benefit of participating in sports and physical exercise have been well established including the reduction in mortality and chronic diseases such as dementia. Long-term studies are now needed of both active and retired rugby players to investigate the effect of participation on long-term brain health. Dr Simon Kemp, Medical Services Director at the Rugby Football Union (RFU) added:  The RFU is fully committed to advancing our understanding of the short, medium and long term consequences of head impacts and concussions so that we can ensure we can make continued improvements in player welfare. We welcome any research that helps to advance our knowledge which is why we actively collaborated with the academic institutions on the Drake Foundation Rugby Biomarker Study from its inception, particularly to promote the recruitment of players.While it is unclear from that research what the individual long-term implications are regarding the brain changes seen in these advanced imaging techniques, it is clearly a priority to investigate this further. To further develop our understanding the RFU, in partnership with Premiership Rugby and independent experts, will be providing a specialist clinical service for the assessment and management of retired elite male and female rugby players between the ages of 30-55 to individually assess their brain health.An integrated research programme will review the risk, causes, assessment and management of brain problems for those who have participated in elite rugby. The study was carried out in collaboration with UCL researchers Dr Etienne Laverse and Professor Huw Morris from the Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology.Professor Huw Morris said:  We have more to learn about the mechanisms and consequences of head injury, and the best approaches to player assessment. This Imperial/UCL collaborative study has brought together expertise from brain sciences across London.The Drake Foundation have pioneered work in this field in the UK and we are very grateful for the support of the foundation, players, medical teams, clubs and the RFU in carrying out this work. We hope that this work, and understanding the long-term implications will ultimately improve safety across contact sports. Reference: Zimmerman KA, Laverse E, Samra R, et al.

SSWs also have profound atmospheric effects at great distances, causing changes in the hemisphere opposite from the location of the original SSW   changes that extend all the way to the upper thermosphere and ionosphere.A study published on July 16 in Geophysical Research Letters by MIT Haystack Observatory s Larisa Goncharenko and colleagues examines the effects of a recent major Antarctic SSW on the Northern Hemisphere by studying changes observed in the upper atmosphere over North America and Europe.In an SSW-caused anomaly, changes over the pole cause changes in the opposite hemisphere. This important interhemispheric linkage was identified as drastic shifts at altitudes greater than 100 km   for example, in total electron content (TEC) measurements as well as variations in the thermospheric O/N2 ratio.SSWs are more frequent over the Arctic; these cause TEC and other related anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere, and thus more observations have been made on this linkage. Since the Antarctic SSWs are less common, there are fewer opportunities to study their effects on the Northern Hemisphere. However, the greater density of TEC observation locations in the Northern Hemisphere allows for precise measurement of these upper atmospheric anomalies when they do occur.In September 2019, an extreme, record-breaking SSW event occurred over Antarctica. Goncharenko and colleagues found significant resulting changes in the upper atmosphere in mid-latitudes over the Northern Hemisphere following this event; more observations are available for this region than in the Southern Hemisphere. The changes were notable not only in severity, but also because they are limited to a narrow (20 40 degrees) longitude range, differ between North America and Europe, and persist for a long time.In the figure above, red areas show where TEC levels are shifted over North America and Europe in the afternoon; red indicates an increase of up to 80 percent versus the baseline regular levels, and blue indicates a decrease of up to  40 percent versus regular levels. This TEC shift persisted throughout September 2019 over the western United States, but was short-lived over Europe, indicating different mechanisms at play.The authors suggest that a change in the thermospheric zonal (east west) winds are one reason for the variance between regions. Another factor is differences in magnetic declination angles; in areas with greater declination, the zonal winds can more efficiently transport plasma to higher or lower altitudes, leading to the build-up or depletion of plasma density.More study is needed to determine the precise extent to which these factors affect the linkage between polar stratospheric events and near-Earth space in the opposite hemisphere. These studies remain a challenge, given the relative rarity of Antarctic SSWs and sparse availability of ionospheric data in the Southern Hemisphere.Reference: Goncharenko LP, Harvey VL, Greer KR, Zhang S, Coster AJ, Paxton LJ.

It ages as its cells age, which happens when those cells eventually stop replicating and dividing. Scientists have long known that genes influence how cells age and how long humans live, but how that works exactly remains unclear. Findings from a new study led by researchers at Washington State University have solved a small piece of that puzzle, bringing scientists one step closer to solving the mystery of aging.A research team headed by Jiyue Zhu, a professor in the College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, recently identified a DNA region known as VNTR2-1 that appears to drive the activity of the telomerase gene, which has been shown to prevent aging in certain types of cells. The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).The telomerase gene controls the activity of the telomerase enzyme, which helps produce telomeres, the caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect the chromosomes within our cells. In normal cells, the length of telomeres gets a little bit shorter every time cells duplicate their DNA before they divide. When telomeres get too short, cells can no longer reproduce, causing them to age and die. However, in certain cell types--including reproductive cells and cancer cells--the activity of the telomerase gene ensures that telomeres are reset to the same length when DNA is copied. This is essentially what restarts the aging clock in new offspring but is also the reason why cancer cells can continue to multiply and form tumors.Knowing how the telomerase gene is regulated and activated and why it is only active in certain types of cells could someday be the key to understanding how humans age, as well as how to stop the spread of cancer. That is why Zhu has focused the past 20 years of his career as a scientist solely on the study of this gene.","Published: July 26, 2021"

A team has recently submitted a patent disclosure with the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station.The research team, led by Abhishek Jain, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering with a joint appointment in the College of Medicine, has created a device that focuses on platelets, tiny blood cells that help the body form clots to stop bleeding. The ovarian tumor microenivornment-chip (OTME-Chip) is about the size of a USB and models the properties of a tumor in the lab. Researchers can use the microdevice to recreate events within platelets circulating in the blood as they approach the tumor and make it more potent and metastatic. We claim several novelties in technological design as well as biological capabilities that didn t exist in prior organs-on-chips,  Jain said.In the evolving field of cancer biology and treatment, innovations in organ-on-a-chip microdevices allow researchers to discover more about the disease outside the human body. These organs-on-chips serve as a model of the state a cancer patient is in, thus allowing an opportunity to finding the correct treatment before administering it to the patient. We are creating a platform technology using the organ-on-a-chip approach where tumor biology can be advanced, and new drugs can be identified by recreating the platelet-tumor and platelet-tumor-drug interactions under the influence of flow, supporting blood vessels and the extracellular matrix,  Jain said.Ovarian cancer is a particularly challenging one to monitor. Tumors generally form deep inside a patient s tissue, and it can be difficult to obtain real-time information of the tumor s properties and how it is interacting with blood cells. Also, ovarian tumors can quickly spread inside the body, making time another vital factor in mapping the disease s progression.The OTME-Chip builds on the current clinically observed understanding of how blood platelets move inside tumor tissue and what triggers them to spread outside the tumor. However, the actual mechanism behind this process remains mostly unknown, until now. For the first time, we identified a crucial interaction between platelets and the tumor via their surface proteins,  Jain said.  By applying high-resolution imaging, advanced cell and molecular readouts and RNA sequencing methods leveraging the OTME-Chip, we discovered the actual genetic signaling pathways behind the blood cell triggered metastasis of ovarian cancer and a new drug strategy to stop this process. Jain s team in College Station for this research includes postdoctoral researcher Biswajit Saha and doctoral students Jim Tronolone and Tanmay Mathur. Their research was recently published in the journal Science Advances.Jain said the OTME-Chip has several applications, both in observing how cancer cells interact differently with vascular and blood cells and testing novel ways to treat the disease that may complement chemotherapy and radiotherapy of tumors. This multimodal OTME-Chip is going to provide an ideal platform to the health care researchers to evaluate their anti-cancer, vascular and hematological drugs individually or in combination in an artificially created human-level tumor microenvironment,  Jain said.Jain collaborates with Dr. Anil Sood, professor and vice chair for translational research in the Departments of Gynecologic Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The team also works with Gang Bao, a gene editing expert from Rice University. Sood is a leader in the ovarian cancer field,  Jain said.  He has been a fantastic collaborator and has provided us access to patient tissue and blood samples needed to validate the findings from our chip, which brings us very close to initiating new clinical trials.

The researchers then determined which macrophages promoted Mtb growth (sporting happy, red-glowing bacteria) or contained stressed Mtb unlikely to grow (unhappy, green-glowing bacteria).Next, they took the two sorted, infected macrophage populations and ran them through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, thereby generating transcriptional profiles of each individual host cell in both populations.When the scientists compared the macrophage single cell sequencing data with the reporter bacteria phenotype, they found an almost perfect one-to-one correlation between the fitness status of the bacterium and the transcriptional profile in the host cell. Macrophages that housed unhappy green bacteria also expressed genes that were known to discourage bacterial growth, while those with happy red bacteria expressed genes known to promote bacterial growth.Scientific experiments rarely play out so nicely.""What absolutely stunned us is how well it worked,"" Russell said. ""When Davide Pisu showed me the analysis I nearly fell off my chair.""Normally, phenotypes and transcriptional profiles are two characteristics that seldom come together in a perfect match, and this almost never happens from in vivo data.This near-perfect matchup revealed new nuances.""While our previous results identifying the resident alveolar macrophages (AM) as permissive and the blood monocyte-derived recruited macrophages (IM) as controlling Mtb infection was correct in a broad sense, we found, unsurprisingly, that this was an oversimplification,"" Russell said.There was variation even within these two different macrophage types: Some AM cells controlled Mtb growth while some IMs were allowing bacterial expansion. The team found that comparable subsets of immune cells were present in both human and mouse lung samples.An additional step in the study was to look at whether the responses of AM and IM cells to Mtb were epigenetically controlled--meaning that the cells' traits are due to certain genes being turned off or on by molecular switches This could explain how two sets of macrophages respond differently. Using a read-out of a cell's epigenetic landscape, they found that this was the case.""The analysis showed that when these cells are exposed to Mtb or the vaccine strain- through infection or vaccination, respectively - their epigenetic programming has a major influence over whether their response leads to disease control or progression,"" Russell said.Armed with this body of new information, the Russell lab plans to hit the ground running to identify novel therapeutics. ""We're going to begin by screening libraries of known epigenetic inhibitor compounds to see which ones might be useful in modifying the immune response,"" Russell said.If they do find promising compounds - ones that push macrophages towards an anti-Mtb behavior - they could potentially be used in combination with vaccines to assist a patient's immune system in protecting against tuberculosis.The finding lays a foundation for more powerful studies on how pathogens affect individual cells, allowing for a holistic examination of the system.""This is a roadmap that lets us look across an entire population of cells and see how a single perturbation impacts the cells across that population,"" Russell said. ""We can test for drug efficacy in in vivo infection without any preconceived limitation on how compounds may function.""This approach is extremely flexible and could be used in the study of any intracellular pathogen, including viruses, and is readily applicable to any animal challenge model.Reference: Pisu D, Huang L, Narang V, et al.

The groundbreaking discovery provides the first proof of a theory from the early 1980s and could have a major impact on fields that study cell movement from regenerative medicine to cancer research.The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), a peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary, high-impact scientific journal.Directed cell movement, or what scientists call ""cell contact guidance,"" refers to a phenomenon when the orientation of cells is influenced by the alignment of fibers within soft tissues. Cells have protrusions, almost like multiple little arms, that move them within the tissue. Cells obviously don't have eyes to sense where they are going, so understanding the mechanisms for how they align their movement with the fibers is considered by researchers to be a final frontier in controlling cell migration.""It's kind of like if someone dropped you in a swimming pool filled with water and thousands of skinny ropes aligned along the length of the pool and told you to swim laps--and then turned off the lights,"" said Robert Tranquillo, the senior researcher on the study and a University of Minnesota professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. ""You'd reach out your arms and legs to try to move through the water and figure out the right direction using the ropes.""Cells need to move for many reasons. They must move to the right places in a developing embryo to become the right cell types. In wound healing, skin cells need to enter into blood clots efficiently to convert the wound into a scar. And research shows that when cancer cells migrate away from solid tumors to spread throughout the body, they're following tracks of a line of fibers. In more recent years, researchers have found that contact guidance is the underlying cellular mechanism by which they can make engineered tissues for regenerative medicine to regrow, repair, or replace damaged or diseased cells, organs, or tissues.""Even though we use cell contact guidance for many processes in my lab to engineer tissues to mimic heart valves and blood vessels, the signal that induces the cell movement in an aligned fiber network has been unclear to us all of these years,"" said Tranquillo, a Distinguished McKnight University Professor.In this new study aimed at understanding contact guidance and improving tissue engineering, Tranquillo's team partnered with researchers at the University of California, Irvine and University of California, Los Angeles to test the mechanical resistance (the stiffness of the fibers) in two different directions in gels of aligned fibers to see if that was a major factor in cell movement instead of the porosity of the fibers or the adhesion (stickiness) of the fibers.""Using a special set of tools previously unavailable to us, we were able to test skin cells that we consider a 'work horse' for developing engineered tissues,"" Tranquillo said. ""What we found is that when we cross-linked the fibers (connecting them at intersections) and increased the difference in the stiffness in the two directions, but kept all the other factors the same, the cells aligned better. This is evidence that a directional difference in mechanical resistance of the fiber network influences cell orientation and movement.""This is the first time anyone has been able to prove one major aspect of the contact guidance theory first proposed by Graham Dunn at King's College in London back in 1982, Tranquillo said.The next steps are to study the porosity and adhesion of the fibers to see if they have an impact on cell movement, as well as to study other cell types.""This is just the first step to truly understand how cells move,"" Tranquillo added. ""If we can learn more about how cells move, it could be a game-changer in many scientific fields.""Reference: Thrivikraman G, Jagie o A, Lai VK, et al.

The world-first research published today in Science, confirms that cockatoos spread this novel behavior through social learning. Led by Barbara Klump and Lucy Aplin from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany, along with John Martin (Taronga Conservation Society) and Richard Major (Australian Museum), the team have shown that this behavior by cockatoos is actually learnt, rather than a result of genetics.Lead co-author, Barbara Klump, said social learning is the basis of different regional cultures, and some animals, such as primates and birds, appear to learn socially.  Children are masters of social learning. From an early age, they copy skills from other children and adults. However, compared to humans, there are few known examples of animals learning from each other,  Klump said.  Demonstrating that food scavenging behavior is not due to genetics is a challenge,  Klump added. However, a few years ago, Richard Major shared a video with senior author Lucy Aplin, showing a sulphur-crested cockatoo opening a closed garbage bin. The cockatoo used its beak and foot to lift the heavy lid then shuffled along the side to flip it over, accessing a rich reward of leftover food. Aplin, who was then researching at Oxford University and has since moved to the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany, and Klump were fascinated by the footage.""It was so exciting to observe such an ingenious and innovative way to access a food resource, we knew immediately that we had to systematically study this unique foraging behavior,  Klump said.","Published: July 23, 2021"

The findings suggest a way forward for developing neuroprotective therapies for glaucoma, a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. The report was published in Cell.Glaucoma results from irreversible neurodegeneration of the optic nerve, the bundle of axons from retinal ganglion cells that transmits signals from the eye to the brain to produce vision. Available therapies slow vision loss by lowering elevated eye pressure, however some glaucoma progresses to blindness despite normal eye pressure. Neuroprotective therapies would be a leap forward, meeting the needs of patients who lack treatment options.""Our study is the first to show that activating the CaMKII pathway helps protect retinal ganglion cells from a variety of injuries and in multiple glaucoma models,"" said the study's lead investigator, Bo Chen, Ph.D., associate professor of ophthalmology and neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.The CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) pathway regulates key cellular processes and functions throughout the body, including retinal ganglion cells in the eye. Yet the precise role of CaMKII in retinal ganglion cell health is not well understood. Inhibition of CaMKII activity, for example, has been shown to be either protective or detrimental to retinal ganglion cells, depending on the conditions.Using an antibody marker of CaMKII activity, Chen's team discovered that CaMKII pathway signaling was compromised whenever retinal ganglion cells were exposed to toxins or trauma from a crush injury to the optic nerve, suggesting a correlation between CaMKII activity and retinal ganglion cell survival.Searching for ways to intervene, they found that activating the CaMKII pathway with gene therapy proved protective to the retinal ganglion cells. Administering the gene therapy to mice just prior to the toxic insult (which initiates rapid damage to the cells), and just after optic nerve crush (which causes slower damage), increased CaMKII activity and robustly protected retinal ganglion cells.Among gene therapy-treated mice, 77% of retinal ganglion cells survived 12 months after the toxic insult compared with 8% in control mice. Six months following optic nerve crush, 77% of retinal ganglion cells had survived versus 7% in controls.Similarly, boosting CaMKII activity via gene therapy proved protective of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma models based on elevated eye pressure or genetic deficiencies.Increasing retinal ganglion cell survival rates translated into greater likelihood of preserved visual function, according to cell activity measured by electroretinogram and patterns of activity in the visual cortex.Three vision-based behavioral tests also confirmed sustained visual function among the treated mice. In a visual water task, the mice were trained to swim toward a submerged platform on the basis of visual stimuli on a computer monitor. Depth perception was confirmed by a visual cliff test based on the mouse's innate tendency to step to the shallow side of a cliff. Lastly, a looming test determined that treated mice were more apt to respond defensively (by hiding, freezing or tail rattling) when shown an overhead stimulus designed to simulate a threat, compared with untreated mice.""If we make retinal ganglion cells more resistant and tolerant to the insults that cause cell death in glaucoma, they might be able to survive longer and maintain their function,"" Chen concluded.Reference: Guo X, Zhou J, Starr C, et al.

These drugs target the same key biological pathway involved in DMG as they do successfully in lymphomas and sarcomas   two cancers common in adults.Adrian Bracken, Professor in Trinity s School of Genetics and Microbiology, led the exciting research. He said: We ve taken a huge step forward in our study of DMG tumours and hope that the insights will help us design and implement precision oncology-based treatment approaches in DMG patients in the future. Crucially,  EZH2 inhibitor  drugs have already received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of two types of adult cancer. We propose these drugs could be impactful for children with DMG and, as a result, call for clinical trials to begin next. Ultimately, we hope that our work   together with that of others focused in this area   will lead to curative clinical approaches for what is a truly terrible disease that can devastate families and for which there are currently no therapeutic options. Paediatric gliomas   harrowing, devastating cancersPaediatric gliomas like DMG are among the most devastating of childhood cancers. Tumours typically arise in the brain and are very challenging to treat, with prognosis extremely poor. As such, effective therapeutic options are urgently needed.Dr Jane Pears, paediatric consultant oncologist at Our Lady s Children s Hospital, Crumlin, who treats children with this disease, said: Despite combined best efforts, these tumours remain a devastating diagnosis for children and their families. The best treatment we can currently offer may extend survival for a few months but is not curative. We are now entering an exciting era of expansion of our knowledge of this disease at a molecular level, which in turn will lead us towards more targeted treatments. Thanks to collaborative translational efforts between scientists, such as Prof. Bracken and his team working in the laboratory, and doctors in the clinical setting, this will hopefully lead to the improved outcomes that we all so dearly wish to see .Speaking to the importance of the work, Maeve Lowery, Professor of Translational Cancer Medicine at Trinity, and Academic Director of the Trinity St James s Cancer Institute (TSJCI) said: These findings have the potential to transform the treatment landscape of DMG tumours and improve outcomes for children with this challenging disease. Importantly, this pivotal work illustrates the success of a precision oncology approach   where understanding how cancers develop on a genomic level can accelerate the development of more effective treatments with less side effects. The Precision Oncology Research Program at TSJCI, led by Prof Bracken, will build on this success to continue to develop new and innovative treatment strategies for adult and childhood cancers. Dr Becky Birch, Head of Research at The Brain Tumour Charity, which helped fund the study, said: This is a really promising discovery that we hope will now pave the way for new and targeted treatments to be developed for children with diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). With average survival still heartbreakingly short at less than 12 months, we urgently need to find new options to help slow the growth of this rare and often-inoperable cancer and give children diagnosed more time to live. It s really exciting that we now better understand how a specific genetic mutation may be driving the disease, and even more so that drugs that may inhibit this process have already been tested in other cancers. If further research can now design EZH2 inhibitors to more effectively target DMG cells, we hope these drugs can be quickly advanced into clinical trials for children diagnosed with this devastating disease.

When the patient's glioblastoma recurred in August 2019, Baskin and his team, already working on the OMF treatment in mouse models, received FDA approval for compassionate use treatment of the patient with their newly invented Oncomagnetic Device under an Expanded Access Program (EAP). The protocol also was approved by the Houston Methodist Research Institute Institutional Review Board.The treatment consisted of intermittent application of an oscillating magnetic field generated by rotating permanent magnets in a specific frequency profile and timing pattern. First administered for two hours under supervision in the Peak Clinic, ensuing treatments were given at home with help from the patient's wife, with increasing treatment times up to a maximum of only six hours per day.The Oncomagnetic Device looks deceptively simple: three oncoscillators securely attached to a helmet and connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery, an invention by case study co-author Dr. Santosh Helekar. During the patient's five weeks of treatment, the magnetic therapy was well-tolerated and the tumor mass and volume shrunk by nearly a third, with shrinkage appearing to correlate with the treatment dose.""Imagine treating brain cancer without radiation therapy or chemotherapy,"" said Baskin.

But how does this happen before they have experienced sight?A new Yale study suggests that, in a sense, mammals dream about the world they are about to experience before they are even born. Writing in the July 23 issue of Science, a team led by Michael Crair, the William Ziegler III Professor of Neuroscience and professor of ophthalmology and visual science, describes waves of activity that emanate from the neonatal retina in mice before their eyes ever open. This activity disappears soon after birth and is replaced by a more mature network of neural transmissions of visual stimuli to the brain, where information is further encoded and stored. At eye opening, mammals are capable of pretty sophisticated behavior,  said Crair, senior author of the study, who is also vice provost for research at Yale.  But how do the circuits form that allow us to perceive motion and navigate the world? It turns out we are born capable of many of these behaviors, at least in rudimentary form.  In the study, Crair s team, led by Yale graduate students Xinxin Ge and Kathy Zhang, explored the origins of these waves of activity. Imaging the brains of mice soon after birth but before their eyes opened, the Yale team found that these retinal waves flow in a pattern that mimics the activity that would occur if the animal were moving forward through the environment.   This early dream-like activity makes evolutionary sense because it allows a mouse to anticipate what it will experience after opening its eyes, and be prepared to respond immediately to environmental threats,  Crair noted. Going further, the Yale team also investigated the cells and circuits responsible for propagating the retinal waves that mimic forward motion in neonatal mice. They found that blocking the function of starburst amacrine cells, which are cells in the retina that release neurotransmitters, prevents the waves from flowing in the direction that mimics forward motion. This in turn impairs the development of the mouse s ability to respond to visual motion after birth. Intriguingly, within the adult retina of the mouse these same cells play a crucial role in a more sophisticated motion detection circuit that allows them to respond to environmental cues.Mice, of course, differ from humans in their ability to quickly navigate their environment soon after birth. However, human babies are also able to immediately detect objects and identify motion, such as a finger moving across their field of vision, suggesting that their visual system was also primed before birth. These brain circuits are self-organized at birth and some of the early teaching is already done,  Crair said.  It s like dreaming about what you are going to see before you even open your eyes.

To stay healthy, cells balance the amounts of functional proteins they contain with the help of a group of enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. These enzymes tag unwanted proteins with a label   the kind of label you stick on someone s back as an April Fool s prank that reads  hit me . Other molecules in the cell recognise this label and destroy any protein wearing it.In addition to their important role as quality control factors, ubiquitin ligases have recently emerged as a powerful medical tool: if scientists could reprogram them to tag a protein of interest   for example proteins associated with diseases   it could have tremendous therapeutic potential. To use these enzymes in such a way, it is crucial to understand the diverse mechanisms through which they operate and how they are safeguarded. One challenge lies in their enormous size, which makes it hard to visualise their structure and the way they choose their targets.Some of these enzymes are very picky: they only tag a handful of specific proteins. Others, such as HUWE1, are generalists and have a wide range of targets - these are the most promising for medical applications, as they might be easier to repurpose.Scientists in Tim Clausen s lab at the IMP and in Dirk Kessler s lab at Boehringer Ingelheim have investigated the structure of HUWE1, revealing its giant coiled shape and its unique modus operandi.

The database and artificial intelligence system provide structural biologists with powerful new tools for examining a protein's three-dimensional structure, and offer a treasure trove of data that could unlock future advances and herald a new era for AI-enabled biology.AlphaFold's recognition in December 2020 by the organisers of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) benchmark as a solution to the 50-year-old grand challenge of protein structure prediction was a stunning breakthrough for the field. The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database builds on this innovation and the discoveries of generations of scientists, from the early pioneers of protein imaging and crystallography, to the thousands of prediction specialists and structural biologists who've spent years experimenting with proteins since. The database dramatically expands the accumulated knowledge of protein structures, more than doubling the number of high-accuracy human protein structures available to researchers. Advancing the understanding of these building blocks of life, which underpin every biological process in every living thing, will help enable researchers across a huge variety of fields to accelerate their work.Last week, the methodology behind the latest highly innovative version of AlphaFold, the sophisticated AI system announced last December that powers these structure predictions, and its open source code were published in Nature.

When a cell moves, the INV moves a particle called an integrin from the cell's surface to 'unstick it' from the surface it is attached to. It then recycles and replaces the integrin to stick it to a new surface.INVs have a protein called Tumour Protein D54, increased levels of which have been associated with certain types of breast cancer and often a poor prognosis for the patient. These patients tend to have more metastases, where tumour cells spread to other parts of the body.To investigate TPD54's role in cell movement, the Warwick team observed cells migrating on a surface coated with fibronectin, a type of extra-cellular matrix, using a live cell microscope. They then reduced or increased the expression of the protein TPD54 to mimic the expression in a cancer cell, observing how the cell migrates more or less depending upon the levels of TPD54.They also conducted the same experiment using ovarian cancer cells inside a 3D mesh rich in fibronectin, a more accurate representation of how a cell would behave inside a tumour. When they depleted the levels of the TPD54 protein, the scientists could see that the cells migrated less.Lead author Professor Stephen Royle, of Warwick Medical School at the University of Warwick, said: ""There are circumstances where you don't want cells to move around, such as in cancer. We show in this paper that if you decrease the levels of the TPD54 protein then cells move less, and if you increase the levels they move more. It offers an explanation for why cancer cells that have overexpression of this protein tend to be more metastatic and spread.""The name Tumour Protein D54 comes from the fact that it is overexpressed in cancer but not a lot is known about it at the molecular level. We have found how this protein attaches to INVs inside cells and controls what cells normally do.""Despite its name, Tumour Protein D54 is involved in a number of normal processes of a cell, and is also involved in the immune response, wound healing, and other functions. The research suggests that TDP54 would not be an ideal target for a cancer intervention due to its role in these normal functions of the cell, but it does give scientists a better understanding of how integrin trafficking is altered in cancer.Professor Royle adds: ""This protein is actually a healthy protein. It's needed for these INVs to move around, to move other cargoes, and perform other functions besides migration. It's one of the most highly expressed proteins in normal cells which indicates that it's probably doing something important. We think it has something to do with this army of INV couriers working within a cell.""But in cancer, we've suddenly got lots of couriers trafficking lots of integrins, and so we get more movement of cells and that's not good. If you've got cancer cells, you don't want them to migrate.""The Warwick group discovered INVs in 2019, having previously been overlooked. At around 30 nanometres across, they were so small that the team had to use a combination of electron microscopy and the Warwick Open Source Microscope, a super-resolution light microscope built at the University of Warwick, to observe them.Professor Royle adds: ""They were hiding in plain sight - you can go back to micrographs from the fifties and can see that they were there, it's just we didn't have the tools to find them.""The bigger question for us is how these vesicles behave and what they carry. They carry a whole range of other proteins and they are likely involved in lots of other cell functions. The thinking within the field is that cargoes like integrins are trafficked in very large tubules, but we're showing that it's actually happening in these smaller vesicles.""Reference: Larocque G, Moore DJ, Sittewelle M, et al.

Researchers from the University of Cambridge have demonstrated how a typical touchscreen could be used to identify common ionic contaminants in soil or drinking water by dropping liquid samples on the screen, the first time this has been achieved. The sensitivity of the touchscreen sensor is comparable to typical lab-based equipment, which would make it useful in low-resource settings.The researchers say their proof of concept could one day be expanded for a wide range of sensing applications, including for biosensing or medical diagnostics, right from the phone in your pocket. The results are reported in the journal Sensors and Actuators B.Touchscreen technology is ubiquitous in our everyday lives: the screen on a typical smartphone is covered in a grid of electrodes, and when a finger disrupts the local electric field of these electrodes, the phone interprets the signal.Other teams have used the computational power of a smartphone for sensing applications, but these have relied on the camera or peripheral devices, or have required significant changes to be made to the screen. We wanted to know if we could interact with the technology in a different way, without having to fundamentally change the screen,  said Dr Ronan Daly from Cambridge s Institute of Manufacturing, who co-led the research.  Instead of interpreting a signal from your finger, what if we could get a touchscreen to read electrolytes, since these ions also interact with the electric fields? The researchers started with computer simulations, and then validated their simulations using a stripped down, standalone touchscreen, provided by two UK manufacturers, similar to those used in phones and tablets.The researchers pipetted different liquids onto the screen to measure a change in capacitance and recorded the measurements from each droplet using the standard touchscreen testing software. Ions in the fluids all interact with the screen's electric fields differently depending on the concentration of ions and their charge. Our simulations showed where the electric field interacts with the fluid droplet. In our experiments, we then found a linear trend for a range of electrolytes measured on the touchscreen,  said first author Sebastian Horstmann, a PhD candidate at IfM.  The sensor saturates at an anion concentration of around 500 micromolar, which can be correlated to the conductivity measured alongside. This detection window is ideal to sense ionic contamination in drinking water. One early application for the technology could be to detect arsenic contamination in drinking water. Arsenic is another common contaminant found in groundwater in many parts of the world, but most municipal water systems screen for it and filter it out before it reaches a household tap. However, in parts of the world without water treatment plants, arsenic contamination is a serious problem. In theory, you could add a drop of water to your phone before you drink it, in order to check that it s safe,  said Daly.At the moment, the sensitivity of phone and tablet screens is tuned for fingers, but the researchers say the sensitivity could be changed in a certain part of the screen by modifying the electrode design in order to be optimised for sensing. The phone s software would need to communicate with that part of the screen to deliver the optimum electric field and be more sensitive for the target ion, but this is achievable,  said Professor Lisa Hall from Cambridge s Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who co-led the research.  We re keen to do much more on this   it s just the first step. While it s now possible to detect ions using a touchscreen, the researchers hope to further develop the technology so that it can detect a wide range of molecules. This could open up a huge range of potential health applications. For example, if we could get the sensitivity to a point where the touchscreen could detect heavy metals, it could be used to test for things like lead in drinking water. We also hope in the future to deliver sensors for home health monitoring,  said Daly. This is a starting point for broader exploration of the use of touchscreen sensing in mobile technologies and the creation of tools that are accessible to everyone, allowing rapid measurements and communication of data,  said Hall.Reference: Horstmann S, Henderson CJ, Hall EAH, Daly R.

This study, published in the scientific journal Current Biology, will contribute to deciphering the genetic background of unique characteristics observed only in marsupials.Genetically modified animals, particularly mice and rats, are extremely important tools for researching biological processes. For example, researchers often silence genes to find out what their normal functions are. Since marsupials have unique characteristics, studying them requires developing a representative animal model. To date, the best option is the opossum, which is thought to be the ancestor of all marsupials. The first marsupial to have its entire genome sequenced, the opossum makes a good model animal because its size and breeding characteristics are similar to those of mice and rats.Like other marsupials, the opossum has a variety of characteristics that are not found in other mammals. It develops without a functional placenta, and pups are born prematurely. Like humans, but not other non-marsupial mammals, it gets skin cancer simply by exposure to ultraviolet light. Also unlike other mammals, newborn opossum pups with spinal cord injuries have the ability to naturally heal themselves. Because of these unique characteristics, studying marsupial biology is gaining interest. However, it has been difficult to analyze their underlying genetics without established technology to genetically modify marsupials. Now, a research team led by Hiroshi Kiyonari at RIKEN BDR is taking advantage of new gene editing technology to get the ball rolling for opossum research.Genome editing requires the systematic collection of fertilized eggs, as the solution for genome editing is injected into the fertilized eggs. Since opossums have a long estrus cycle and a strong sense of territoriality, it takes about a week for a couple to mate even if they live together, making it difficult to proceed with the experiment systematically. The research team administered a hormone used in mice and other laboratory animals to stimulate estrus in the females, and succeeded in significantly shortening the time required for mating.Transplant of the embryo into a surrogate mother is required to generate a genome-edited fertilized egg. As is done in mice and rats, the researchers transferred the fertilized egg into the uterus of a fertile female opossum, and successfully obtained pups. This is the first case that embryo transfer technology has been established in marsupials.Usually the solution required for genome editing is injected into the fertilized egg using a fine needle. However, since the fertilized egg of the opossum is surrounded by a thick layer of proteins and a hard shell-like structure, the injection needle cannot penetrate it. ""One of the tricks to our success,"" Kiyonari explains, ""was using a piezoelectronic element along with the needle, which allowed the needle to penetrate the hard shell coat and thick layer surrounding the egg. The piezo has thus made it possible to inject zygotes without significant damage.""To confirm overall methodology, researchers targeted a gene responsible for making body pigments. When this gene is disrupted, pigment cannot be produced, and skin lacks color. Some of the offspring obtained from this experiment were albino, and their genes were inherited by the next generation, Thus, this represents the first successful gene editing in marsupials.Now that the process has been established, researchers can focus on answering all their questions about marsupial biology. ""Marsupials represent one of three extant mammalian subclasses with a number of unique characteristics not shared by other mammals. Having established the technology in this proof-of-concept experiment, future studies can create genetically modified marsupials that will impact the fields of mammalian embryology, genomic imprinting, reproduction, neurobiology, immunogenetics, cancer biology, and even comparative evolution,"" Kiyonari says.Reference: Kiyonari H, Kaneko M, Abe T, et al.

This then enables immune cells to seek out and destroy this potentially deadly virus.Around four out of five people in the UK are thought to be infected with HCMV, and in developing countries this can be as high as 95%. For the majority of people, the virus remains dormant, hidden away inside white blood cells, where it can remain undisturbed and undetected for decades. If the virus reactivates in a healthy individual, it does not usually cause symptoms. However, for people who are immunocompromised - for example, transplant recipients who need to take immunosuppressant drugs to prevent organ rejection - HCMV reactivation can be devastating.At present, there is no effective vaccine against HCMV, and anti-viral drugs often prove ineffective or have very serious side-effects.Now, in a study published in Nature Communications, researchers at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands and at the University of Cambridge have found a way to chase the virus from its hiding place using a special type of antibody known as a nanobody.Nanobodies were first identified in camels and exist in all camelids - a family of animals that also includes dromedary, llamas and alpacas. Human antibodies consist of two heavy and two light chains of molecules, which together recognise and bind to markers on the surface of a cell or virus known as antigens. For this special class of camelid antibodies, however, only a single fragment of the antibody - often referred to as single domain antibody or nanobody - is sufficient to properly recognize antigens.Dr Timo De Groof from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the study's joint first author, said: ""As the name suggests, nanobodies are much smaller than regular antibodies, which make them perfectly suited for particular types of antigens and relatively easy to manufacture and adjust. That's why they're being hailed as having the potential to revolutionise antibody therapies.""The first nanobody has been approved and introduced onto the market by biopharmaceutical company Ablynx, while other nanobodies are already in clinical trials for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers. Now, the team in The Netherlands and the UK have developed nanobodies that target a specific virus protein (US28), one of the few elements detectable on the surface of a HCMV latently infected cell and a main driver of this latent state.Dr Ian Groves from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge said: ""Our team has shown that nanobodies derived from llamas have the potential to outwit human cytomegalovirus. This could be very important as the virus can cause life threating complications in people whose immune systems are not functioning properly.""In laboratory experiments using blood infected with the virus, the team showed that the nanobody binds to the US28 protein and interrupts the signals established through the protein that help keep the virus in its dormant state. Once this control is broken, the local immune cells are able to 'see' that the cell is infected, enabling the host's immune cells to hunt down and kill the virus, purging the latent reservoir and clearing the blood of the virus.Dr Elizabeth Elder, joint first author, who carried out her work while at the University of Cambridge, said: ""The beauty of this approach is that it reactivates the virus just enough to make it visible to the immune system, but not enough for it to do what a virus normally does - replicating and spreading. The virus is forced to put its head above the parapet where it can then be killed by the immune system.""Professor Martine Smit, also from from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, added: ""We believe our approach could lead to a much-needed new type of treatment for reducing - and potentially even preventing - CMV infectious in patients eligible for organ and stem cell transplants.""Reference: De Groof TWM, Elder EG, Lim EY, et al.

Correct distribution of chromosomes requires high accuracy and defects in this process can cause aberrant distribution of chromosomes and facilitate cancer development. By analyzing the structure of the protein responsible for chromosome separation, an international team, led by scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), has shed light on the mechanisms controlling this essential player in cell division. This work is published in the journal Nature.Before dividing, the cell duplicates its DNA and goes from single chromosomes with one arm to double chromosomes with two identical arms linked together by a ring-shaped protein complex: cohesin. The two arms are then separated by the action of a molecular scissor - separase - which cuts a subunit of the cohesin complex to open up the ring. Once the chromosomes are separated, the cell divides and gives birth to two identical daughter cells. The cleavage of cohesin by separase is highly regulated and must occur only at a very specific time during the cell cycle. To achieve this, several inhibitory proteins independently block the activity of separase until the chromosomes have to be separated. However, up until now, the molecular mechanisms by which inhibitors control separase activity have remained elusive.Reference: Yu J, Raia P, Ghent CM, et al.

PNNs are cartilage-like structures that mostly surround inhibitory neurons in the brain. Their main function is to control the level of plasticity in the brain. They appear at around five years old in humans, and turn off the period of enhanced plasticity during which the connections in the brain are optimised. Then, plasticity is partially turned off, making the brain more efficient but less plastic.PNNs contain compounds known as chondroitin sulphates. Some of these, such as chondroitin 4-sulphate, inhibit the action of the networks, inhibiting neuroplasticity; others, such as chondroitin 6-sulphate, promote neuroplasticity. As we age, the balance of these compounds changes, and as levels of chondroitin 6-sulphate decrease, so our ability to learn and form new memories changes, leading to age-related memory decline.Researchers at the University of Cambridge and University of Leeds investigated whether manipulating the chondroitin sulphate composition of the PNNs might restore neuroplasticity and alleviate age-related memory deficits.To do this, the team looked at 20-month old mice - considered very old - and using a suite of tests showed that the mice exhibited deficits in their memory compared to six-month old mice.For example, one test involved seeing whether mice recognised an object. The mouse was placed at the start of a Y-shaped maze and left to explore two identical objects at the end of the two arms. After a short while, the mouse was once again placed in the maze, but this time one arm contained a new object, while the other contained a copy of the repeated object. The researchers measured the amount of the time the mouse spent exploring each object to see whether it had remembered the object from the previous task. The older mice were much less likely to remember the object.The team treated the ageing mice using a 'viral vector', a virus capable of reconstituting the amount of 6-sulphate chondroitin sulphates to the PNNs and found that this completely restored memory in the older mice, to a level similar to that seen in the younger mice.Dr Jessica Kwok from the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Leeds said: ""We saw remarkable results when we treated the ageing mice with this treatment. The memory and ability to learn were restored to levels they would not have seen since they were much younger.""To explore the role of chondroitin 6-sulphate in memory loss, the researchers bred mice that had been genetically-manipulated such that they were only able to produce low levels of the compound to mimic the changes of ageing. Even at 11 weeks, these mice showed signs of premature memory loss. However, increasing levels of chondroitin 6-sulphate using the viral vector restored their memory and plasticity to levels similar to healthy mice.Professor James Fawcett from the John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair at the University of Cambridge said: ""What is exciting about this is that although our study was only in mice, the same mechanism should operate in humans - the molecules and structures in the human brain are the same as those in rodents. This suggests that it may be possible to prevent humans from developing memory loss in old age.""The team have already identified a potential drug, licensed for human use, that can be taken by mouth and inhibits the formation of PNNs. When this compound is given to mice and rats it can restore memory in ageing and also improves recovery in spinal cord injury. The researchers are investigating whether it might help alleviate memory loss in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.The approach taken by Professor Fawcett's team - using viral vectors to deliver the treatment - is increasingly being used to treat human neurological conditions. A second team at the Centre recently published research showing their use for repairing damage caused by glaucoma and dementia.Reference: Yang S, Gigout S, Molinaro A, et al.

However, the possible emergence of vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as novel coronaviruses, make finding treatments that work against all coronaviruses as important as ever. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Journal of Proteome Research have analyzed viral proteins across 27 coronavirus species and thousands of samples from COVID-19 patients, identifying highly conserved sequences that could make the best drug targets.Drugs often bind inside  pockets  on proteins that hold the drug snugly, causing it to interfere with the protein s function. Scientists can identify potential drug-binding pockets from the 3D structures of viral proteins. Over time, however, viruses can mutate their protein pockets so that drugs no longer fit. But some drug-binding pockets are so essential to the protein s function that they can t be mutated, and these sequences are generally conserved over time in the same and related viruses. Matthieu Schapira and colleagues wanted to find the most highly conserved drug-binding pockets in viral proteins from COVID-19 patient samples and from other coronaviruses, revealing the most promising targets for pan-coronavirus drugs.  The team used a computer algorithm to identify drug-binding pockets in the 3D structures of 15 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The researchers then found corresponding proteins in 27 coronavirus species and compared their sequences in the drug-binding pockets. The two most conserved druggable sites were a pocket overlapping the RNA binding site of the helicase nsp13, and a binding pocket containing the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12. Both of these proteins are involved in viral RNA replication and transcription. The drug-binding pocket on nsp13 was also the most highly conserved across thousands of SARS-CoV-2 samples taken from COVID-19 patients, with not a single mutation. The researchers say that novel antiviral drugs targeting the catalytic site of nsp12 are currently in phase II and III clinical trials for COVID-19, and that the RNA binding site of nsp13 is a previously underexplored target that should be a high priority for drug development.Reference: Yazdani S, De Maio N, Ding Y, Shahani V, Goldman N, Schapira M.

Smelly breath can make things awkward, but it also is a natural warning sign, indicating that serious dental issues are occurring. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Nano have constructed a portable, thumb-sized device that diagnoses bad breath by quickly  sniffing  exhalations for the gas that makes it stinky   hydrogen sulfide.Because most people can t smell their own breath, they need to ask someone else, which can be embarrassing and awkward. Some devices measure small amounts of stinky hydrogen sulfide, but they require exhaled air to be collected and tested on expensive instruments in a lab, which is not feasible for consumers. Previous studies have shown that when some metal oxides react with sulfur-containing gases, their electrical conductivity changes. And when metal oxides are paired with noble metal catalysts, they can become more sensitive and selective. So, to develop a small, real-time bad-breath analyzer, Kak Namkoong, Il-Doo Kim and colleagues wanted to find the right combination of substances that would elicit the fastest and strongest response to hydrogen sulfide in air blown directly onto it.The researchers mixed sodium chloride (an alkali metal salt) and platinum (a noble metal catalyst) nanoparticles with tungsten, and electrospun the solution into nanofibers that they heated, converting the tungsten into its metal oxide form. In preliminary tests, the composite made from equal parts of each metal had the largest reactivity to hydrogen sulfide, which the team measured as a large decrease in electrical resistance in less than 30 seconds. Although this nanofiber reacted with a few sulfur-containing gases, it was most sensitive to hydrogen sulfide, creating a response 9.5 and 2.7 times greater than with dimethyl sulfide or methyl mercaptan, respectively. Finally, the team coated interdigitated gold electrodes with the nanofibers and combined the gas sensor with humidity, temperature and pressure sensors into a small prototype device that was about the size of a human thumb. The device correctly identified bad breath 86% of the time when real breaths from people were exhaled directly onto it. The researchers say that their sensor could be incorporated into very small devices for quick and easy self-diagnosis of bad breath.Reference: Shin H, Kim D-H, Jung W, et al.

This situation could happen again during future outbreaks, especially with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on the rise. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Analytical Chemistry have developed a blood test to predict which people infected with COVID-19 are most likely to experience serious symptoms, which could help health care workers prioritize patients for hospitalization and intensive care.Although many people who contract COVID-19 have either no symptoms or mild ones, some require intensive care for pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Risk factors for severe disease include older age, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, but these characteristics alone are not sufficient to predict which patients will become the sickest. Measuring levels of certain proteins or metabolites in the blood could help, but these tests are often slow, complicated or expensive. For more effective triage of COVID-19 patients at hospitals, Michelle Hill, Sanjeeva Srivastava and colleagues aimed to develop an easy-to-use method that could quickly and cost-effectively predict COVID-19 severity.To measure changes in blood biochemistry that occur with severe COVID-19, the researchers chose a technique called attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), which has been tested previously as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool. Two regions of FTIR spectra from 128 patient plasma samples showed small but observable differences between those with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Using these data together with clinical information about patients, the researchers developed a statistical model to predict COVID-19 severity. They found that the best predictor was whether the patient had diabetes, followed by the two regions in the FTIR spectra. Adding the FTIR data to the model improved the sensitivity for detecting severe disease in a different set of 30 patients from 41.2% to 94.1%, but reduced the specificity from 84.6% to 69.2%, compared with the clinical factors alone. This means that the new test was more likely to identify severe cases, but it also had a higher rate of false positives, than the clinical data alone. Although the strategy needs to be tested in larger numbers of patients, it shows promise as a rapid, simple and economic triaging test for hospitals, the researchers say.Reference: Banerjee A, Gokhale A, Bankar R, et al.

Areas that absorb more carbon than they emit are called carbon sinks. But plants can also emit the greenhouse gas during processes like respiration, when dead plants decay, or during combustion in the case of fires. Researchers are particularly interested in whether   and how   plants at the scale of an ecosystem like a forest act as sources or sinks in an increasingly warming world.A recent study led by scientists at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California identified whether vegetated areas like forests and savannas around the world were carbon sources or sinks every year from 2000 to 2019. The research found that over the course of those two decades, living woody plants were responsible for more than 80% of the sources and sinks on land, with soil, leaf litter, and decaying organic matter making up the rest. But they also saw that vegetation retained a far smaller fraction of the carbon than the scientists originally thought.In addition, the researchers found that the total amount of carbon emitted and absorbed in the tropics was four times larger than in temperate regions and boreal areas (the northernmost forests) combined, but that the ability of tropical forests to absorb massive amounts of carbon has waned in recent years. The decline in this ability is because of large-scale deforestation, habitat degradation, and climate change effects, like more frequent droughts and fires. In fact, the study, published in Science Advances, showed that 90% of the carbon that forests around the world absorb from the atmosphere is offset by the amount of carbon released by such disturbances as deforestation and droughts.The scientists created maps of carbon sources and sinks from land-use changes like deforestation, habitat degradation, and forest planting, as well as forest growth. They did so by analyzing data on global vegetation collected from space using instruments such as NASA s Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board ICESat and the agency s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The analysis used a machine-learning algorithm that the researchers first trained using vegetation data gathered on the ground and in the air using laser-scanning instruments.","Published: July 22, 2021"

However, commercially available molten sodium batteries, called sodium-sulfur batteries, typically operate at 520-660 degrees Fahrenheit. Sandia s new molten sodium-iodide battery operates at a much cooler 230 degrees Fahrenheit instead. We ve been working to bring the operating temperature of molten sodium batteries down as low as physically possible,  said Leo Small, the lead researcher on the project.  There s a whole cascading cost savings that comes along with lowering the battery temperature. You can use less expensive materials. The batteries need less insulation and the wiring that connects all the batteries can be a lot thinner. However, the battery chemistry that works at 550 degrees doesn t work at 230 degrees, he added. Among the major innovations that allowed this lower operating temperature was the development of what he calls a catholyte.

Instead, the brain relies on the hundreds of miles of blood vessels within it to supply fresh energy via the blood. Yet, how the brain expresses a need for more energy during increased activity and then directs its blood supply to specific hot spots was, until now, poorly understood.Now, University of Maryland School of Medicine and University of Vermont researchers have shown how the brain communicates to blood vessels when in need of energy, and how these blood vessels respond by relaxing or constricting to direct blood flow to specific brain regions.In their new paper, published on July 21 in Science Advances, the researchers say that understanding how the brain directs energy to itself in intricate detail can help determine what goes wrong in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia, where faulty blood flow is a predictor for cognitive impairment. If the brain does not get blood to where it needs it when it needs it, the neurons become stressed, and over time they deteriorate ultimately leading to cognitive decline and memory problems.Large arteries feed medium-sized vessels known as arterioles that then feed even tinier capillaries--so small that only a single blood cell can pass through at once. In a 2017 Nature Neuroscience paper, the researchers showed that electrical pulses coursing through the capillaries direct blood flow from the medium-sized arterioles supplying large regions of the brain. For this latest paper, the team wanted to study the fine-tuning of blood as it flows through the capillaries to precisely regulate energy supply to tiny regions in the brain.""There seem to be two mechanisms working in tandem to ensure that energy in the form of blood makes it to specific regions of the brain: one broad and the other precise,"" says Thomas Longden, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Physiology at University of Maryland School of Medicine. ""The first electrical mechanism is like a crude sledgehammer approach to get more blood to the general vicinity of the increased brain activity by controlling the medium-sized arterioles, and then capillary calcium signals ensure exquisite fine-tuning to make sure the blood gets to exactly the right place at the right time through the tiny capillaries.""Dr. Longden and his collaborators used a protein which emits green light when calcium increases in the cell. Due to the efforts of Michael Kotlikoff's team at Cornell University, they were able to turn this tool on in the cells lining blood vessels of mice. The researchers then looked through little windows in the brains of these mice to investigate calcium's role in controlling blood flow in the brain's capillaries. When the cells lining the blood vessels received an influx of calcium, they glowed green. They detected 5,000 calcium signals per second in the capillaries in the tiny section of brain visible through the window, which they say amounts to about 1,000,000 of these responses each second in the entire brain's blood vessel system.""Until we deployed this new technology, there was this wholly unseen world of calcium signaling in the brain hidden from view, and now we can see a ton of activity within the brains blood vessels - they are constantly firing,"" says Dr. Longden.Dr. Longden and the research team then dissected the intricate cellular mechanism behind calcium's role in directing blood branch-by-branch through the tiny vessels of the brain. They found that when neurons fire electrical signals, they cause an increase in calcium in the cells lining the blood vessels. Then enzymes detect this calcium and direct the cells to make nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a hormone (and a gas) that causes muscle-like cells around blood vessels to relax, which then widens the vessels allowing more blood to flow in.""Capillaries were traditionally thought as simple conduits for red blood cells, and the barrier between the blood and brain,"" says co-senior author Mark T. Nelson, PhD, University of Vermont Distinguished Professor and Chair of Pharmacology. ""Here, we revealed an unknown universe of calcium signaling in capillaries, and much like traffic lights, these calcium signals direct vital nutrients to nearby active neurons.""""The first step towards figuring out what goes wrong in diseases is to determine how the system works as it normally should,"" says E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean, University of Maryland School of Medicine. ""Now that the researchers have a handle on how this process works, they can begin to investigate how the blood flow is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease and dementia in order to figure out ways to fix it.""Reference: Longden TA, Mughal A, Hennig GW, et al.

The newly developed drug, called ErSO, quickly shrinks even large tumors to undetectable levels.Led by scientists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the research team reports the findings in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Even when a few breast cancer cells do survive, enabling tumors to regrow over several months, the tumors that regrow remain completely sensitive to retreatment with ErSO,  said U. of I. biochemistry professor David Shapiro, who led the research with Illinois chemistry professor Paul Hergenrother.  It is striking that ErSO caused the rapid destruction of most lung, bone and liver metastases and dramatic shrinkage of brain metastases, since tumors that have spread to other sites in the body are responsible for most breast cancer deaths,  Shapiro said. (Watch a video about the results.)The activity of ErSO depends on a protein called the estrogen receptor, which is present in a high percentage of breast tumors. When ErSO binds to the estrogen receptor, it upregulates a cellular pathway that prepares cancer cells for rapid growth and protects them from stress. This pathway, called the anticipatory Unfolded Protein Response, or a-UPR, spurs the production of proteins that protect the cell from harm. The a-UPR is already on, but running at a low level, in many breast cancer cells,  Shapiro said.  It turns out that this pathway shields cancer cells from being killed off by anti-cancer drugs. Shapiro and former U. of I. medical scholar Neal Andruska first identified the a-UPR pathway in 2014 and reported the development of a compound that pushed the a-UPR pathway into overdrive to selectively kill estrogen-receptor-containing breast cancer cells. Because this pathway is already on in cancer cells, it s easy for us to overactivate it, to switch the breast cancer cells into lethal mode,  said graduate student Darjan Duraki, who shares first-author status on the new report with graduate student Matthew Boudreau.While the original compound prevented breast cancer cells from growing, it did not rapidly kill them, and it had undesirable side effects. For the new research, Shapiro and Hergenrother worked together on a search for a much more potent small molecule that would target the a-UPR. Their analysis led to the discovery of ErSO, a small molecule that had powerful anticancer properties without detectable side effects in mice, further tests revealed. This anticipatory UPR is estrogen-receptor dependent,  Hergenrother said.  The unique thing about this compound is that it doesn t touch cells that lack the estrogen receptor, and it doesn t affect healthy cells   whether or not they have an estrogen receptor. But it s super-potent against estrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. ErSO is nothing like the drugs that are commonly used to treat estrogen-responsive cancers, Shapiro said. This is not another version of tamoxifen or fulvestrant, which are therapeutically used to block estrogen signaling in breast cancer,  he said. Even though it binds to the same receptor that estrogen binds, it targets a different site on the estrogen receptor and attacks a protective cellular pathway that is already turned on in cancer cells, he said. Since about 75% of breast cancers are estrogen-receptor positive, ErSO has potential against the most common form of breast cancer,  Boudreau said.  The amount of estrogen receptor needed for ErSO to target a breast cancer is very low, so ErSO may also work against some breast cancers not traditionally considered to be ER-positive. Further studies in mice showed that exposure to the drug had no effect on their reproductive development. And the compound was well tolerated in mice, rats and dogs given doses much higher than required for therapeutic efficacy, the researchers found.ErSO also worked quickly, even against advanced, human-derived breast cancer tumors in mice, the researchers report. Often within a week of exposure to ErSO, advanced human-derived breast cancers in mice shrank to undetectable levels. Many of these breast cancers shrink by more than 99% in just three days,  Shapiro said.  ErSO is fast-acting and its effects on breast cancers in mice are large and dramatic. The pharmaceutical company Bayer AG has licensed the new drug and will explore its potential for further study in human clinical trials targeting estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers, the researchers said. The researchers will next explore whether ErSO is effective against other types of cancers that contain estrogen receptor.Reference: Boudreau MW, Duraki D, Wang L, et al.

Although this adaptive response is theoretically reversible, such a reversal is hampered by numerous molecular mechanisms that allow the cancer cells to adapt to the treatment. The analysis of these mechanisms is limited by the complexity of cause and effect relationships that are extremely difficult to observe in vivo in tumor samples. In order to overcome this challenge, a team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG), Switzerland, has used information theory for the first time, in order to objectify in vivo the molecular regulations at play in the mechanisms of the adaptive response and their modulation by a therapeutic combination. These results are published in the journal Neoplasia.Adaptive response limits the efficiency of targeted therapies used to fight the development of tumors: after an effective treatment phase that reduces the tumor size, an adaptation to the used molecule occurs that allows the tumor cells to proliferate again.  We now know that this resistance to treatment has a large reversible component that does not involve mutations, which are an irreversible process , explains Rastine Merat, a researcher in the Department of Pathology and Immunology at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, the head of the Onco-Dermatology Unit at the HUG and the principal investigator of the study.

Researchers at KU Leuven, Belgium, examined the effect of these antibiotics on patient-derived tumours in mice. Their findings were published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.Researchers from KU Leuven may have found a new weapon in the fight against melanoma: antibiotics that target the 'power plants' of cancer cells. These antibiotics exploit a vulnerability that arises in tumour cells when they try to survive cancer therapy.""As the cancer evolves, some melanoma cells may escape the treatment and stop proliferating to 'hide' from the immune system. These are the cells that have the potential to form a new tumour mass at a later stage"" explains cancer researcher and RNA biologist Eleonora Leucci (KU Leuven). ""In order to survive the cancer treatment however, those inactive cells need to keep their 'power plants' - the mitochondria - switched on at all times"". As mitochondria derive from bacteria that, over time, started living inside cells, they are very vulnerable to a specific class of antibiotics. This is what gave us the idea to use these antibiotics as anti-melanoma agents.""The researchers implanted patient-derived tumours into mice, which were then treated with antibiotics - either as the only treatment or in combination with existing anti-melanoma therapies. Leucci: ""The antibiotics quickly killed many cancer cells and could thus be used to buy the precious time needed for immunotherapy to kick in. In tumours that were no longer responding to targeted therapies, the antibiotics extended the lifespan of - and in some cases even cured - the mice.""The researchers worked with antibiotics that are now, because of rising antibiotic resistance, only rarely used in bacterial infection. However, this resistance has no effect on the efficacy of the treatment in this study, explains Leucci. ""The cancer cells show high sensitivity to these antibiotics, so we can now look to repurpose them to treat cancer instead of bacterial infections.""However, patients with melanoma shouldn't start experimenting, warns Leucci. ""Our findings are based on research in mice, so we don't know how effective this treatment is in human beings. Our study mentions only one human case where a melanoma patient received antibiotics to treat a bacterial infection, and this re-sensitised a resistant melanoma lesion to standard therapy. This result is cause for optimism, but we need more research and clinical studies to examine the use of antibiotics to treat cancer patients. Together with oncologist Oliver Bechter (KU Leuven/UZ Leuven), who is a co-author of this study, we are currently exploring our options.""Reference: Vendramin R, Katopodi V, Cinque S, et al.
