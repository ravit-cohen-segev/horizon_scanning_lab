Mounting evidence, however, suggests that concussions are caused by a different type of head motion, namely brain and skull rotation. Now, a group of Stanford engineers has produced a collection of results that suggest that current helmet-testing equipment and techniques are not optimized for evaluating these additional injury-causing elements. The ideal way to test any protective gear is to gain a sense of what causes the trauma, set up a system that replicates the way the trauma occurs, and then evaluate the gear against the injury-causing criteria. For the past several years, David Camarillo, an assistant professor of bioengineering and, by courtesy, of mechanical engineering at Stanford, and his students have been collecting and analyzing data in hopes of identifying the signature skull motions that cause concussions. The brain is like a bowl of Jell-O. Give the bowl a push, and the dessert takes some time to react, but once it gets moving, the Jell-O overshoots its limits and begins wiggling back and forth. This period of brain movement within the skull is a potentially dangerous time for injury to occur. Acceleration is important, but so is the timing of deceleration, Camarillo said. If the bowl moves forward right as the Jell-O is decelerating backward, it could cause the Jell-O to deform even further. ""The same is true for the brain moving within the skull,"" Camarillo said. ""It's possible that injury happens when the head whips back and accelerates the brain in one direction right as the brain is starting to go in the opposite direction."" Camarillo's team first set out to determine what degree of oscillation is dangerous. They fed pre-existing MRI data into a computer model of the brain, and found that the brain's relative motion is amplified when the head oscillates at 15-20 Hz, completing a single back-and-forth motion in about 50 milliseconds. They compared this to field data of sports-related head impacts -- which they had collected over the past several years from Stanford football players who wear mouthguards instrumented with accelerometers -- and found that players frequently experienced head oscillations in the 20 Hz range. ""We know that if the head shakes at that frequency, the brain starts to rattle more violently,"" said Kaveh Laksari, a postdoctoral scholar in Camarillo's lab, and first author on the paper. ""So we have this mechanical system that exhibits a dangerous mode of motion, and then we find that the in-game impacts excite it at that frequency or something close to it. This introduces a fresh viewpoint on the possible cause of repetitive brain trauma. We need to keep that in mind when we're designing protective equipment."" The standard test for every football helmet used in the NFL or NCAA involves a guillotine-like device that drops a helmet-clad dummy head from multiple heights to approximate various impact magnitudes. But when Fidel Hernandez, a Stanford doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering, began comparing results from this drop test to what Camarillo's group had observed in the field, it was like looking at two different data sets. High rotational velocities, which are thought to induce brain strain and have been predictive of concussions, were observed in the field impacts but not the drop tests. And while field data showed rotational head motions in the 15-20 Hz range, drop tests generated much faster, 100 Hz movements. Similarly, rotational accelerations were substantially lower in certain drop tests. Drop testing was also unable to produce accelerations across the full six-degrees-of-freedom spectrum of directions observed in field impacts, and which Camarillo's group has previously shown are important factors in an injury. ""The problem with having a model that doesn't re-create what players actually experience in the field, is that you could optimize a helmet to perform well in the drop test that unintentionally performs poorly in the field,"" said Hernandez, who was lead author on the study. ""For instance, you could design a helmet to stop linear head motion or high-frequency head vibration, because that shows up in the test, but that might not be what is most dangerous to your brain."" The new work suggests there's room for improvement, Camarillo said. Currently, the two primary tests for evaluating helmet safety measure the duration of the acceleration for only 15-36 milliseconds, which he said is probably too short a period given that the brain takes more than 50 milliseconds to begin moving, and the real injury may occur after that. Camarillo's group is testing a slingshot-like system that propels an impactor into a stationary head to test impact velocities and accelerations in six degrees of freedom. They are also experimenting with various crash-dummy necks to make sure that it flexes in a way that is more similar to actual humans, and testing if tweaking the drop test could help it better mirror field data. The work, and ultimately identifying the key trauma-inducing factors, has a long way to go, Camarillo said, and could benefit from stricter guidelines. ""My opinion is that there should be some government regulation in standardizing helmet tests,"" Camarillo said. ""Hopefully people can use the methods we've described here to show that impact forces are being reproduced sufficiently or realistically compared to what's happening in the field.""

Previous research has shown that our metabolism is negatively affected by sleep loss, and sleep loss has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Since ablation of clock genes in animals can cause these disease states, our current results indicate that changes of our clock genes may be linked to such negative effects caused by sleep loss , says Jonathan Cedernaes, lead author on the study and a researcher at Uppsala University. For the study the researchers studied 15 healthy normal-weight men who on two separate occasions came to the lab for almost 2-night long stays. During the second night the participants slept as usual (over 8 hours) in one of the two sessions, while they were kept awake in the other of these sessions, but in random order. To minimize the influence of various environmental factors, light conditions, food intake and activity levels in the lab were strictly controlled and the participants were bed-restricted when they were kept awake. Following the second night on both occasions that the men were studied, small tissue samples were taken from the superficial fat on the stomach, and from the muscle on the thigh   two kinds of tissues that are important for regulating metabolism and controlling blood sugar levels. Blood samples were also taken before and after the participants had consumed a sugar solution to test their insulin sensitivity, a practice commonly done to exclude the presence of diabetes or a metabolic state called impaired insulin sensitivity, which can precede type-2 diabetes. Molecular analyses of the collected tissue samples showed that the regulation and activity of clock genes was altered after one night of sleep loss. The activity of genes is regulated by a mechanism called epigenetics. This involves chemical alterations to the DNA molecule such as methyl groups   a process called methylation   which regulates how the genes are switched on or off. The researchers found that clock genes had increased numbers of such DNA marks after sleep loss. They also found that the expression of the genes, which is indicative of how much of the genes  product is made, was altered.  As far as we know, we are the first to directly show that epigenetic changes can occur after sleep loss in humans, but also in these important tissues , says Dr. Cedernaes.  It was interesting that the methylation of these genes could be altered so quickly, and that it could occur for these metabolically important clock genes , he continues. The changes that the researchers observed were however different in the adipose tissue and the skeletal muscle.  This could suggest that these important molecular clocks are no longer synchronized between these two tissues , Dr. Cedernaes says.  As such,  clock desynchrony  between tissues has been linked to metabolic pathologies, this could suggest that these tissue-specific changes were linked to the impaired glucose tolerance that our participants demonstrated after the night that they had been kept awake  The researchers do not at this stage know how persistent these changes are.  It could be that these changes are reset after one or several nights of good sleep. On the other hand, epigenetic marks are suggested to be able to function a sort of metabolic memory, and have been found to be altered in e.g. shift workers and people suffering from type 2 diabetes , Dr. Cedernaes points out.  This could mean that at least some types of sleep loss or extended wakefulness, as in shift work, could lead to changes in the genome of your tissues that can affect your metabolism for longer periods , Dr. Cedernaes concludes.

Hao Yan, a researcher at Arizona State University s Biodesign Institute, has worked for many years to refine the technique. His aim is to compose new sets of design rules, vastly expanding the range of nanoscale architectures generated by the method. In new research, a variety of innovative nanoforms are described, each displaying unprecedented design control. Yan is the Milton D. Glick Distinguished Chair of Chemistry and Biochemistry and directs Biodesign s Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics. In the current study, complex nano-forms displaying arbitrary wireframe architectures have been created, using a new set of design rules.  Earlier design methods used strategies including parallel arrangement of DNA helices to approximate arbitrary shapes, but precise fine-tuning of DNA wireframe architectures that connect vertices in 3D space has required a new approach,  Yan says. Yan has long been fascinated with Nature s seemingly boundless capacity for design innovation. The new study describes wireframe structures of high complexity and programmability, fabricated through the precise control of branching and curvature, using novel organizational principles for the designs. (Wireframes are skeletal three-dimensional models represented purely through lines and vertices.) The resulting nanoforms include symmetrical lattice arrays, quasicrystalline structures, curvilinear arrays, and a simple wire art sketch in the 100-nm scale, as well as 3-D objects including a snub cube with 60 edges and 24 vertices and a reconfigurable Archimedean solid that can be controlled to make the unfolding and refolding transitions between 3-D and 2-D. In previous investigations, the Yan group created subtle architectural forms at an astonishingly minute scale, some measuring only tens of nanometers across   roughly the diameter of a virus particle. These nano-objects includespheres, spirals, flasks, M bius forms, and even an autonomous spider-like robot capable of following a prepared DNA track. The technique of DNA origami capitalizes on the simple base-pairing properties of DNA, a molecule built from the four nucleotides Adenine (A), Thymine (T) Cytosine (C) and (Guanine). The rules of the game are simple: A s always pair with T s and C s with G s. Using this abbreviated vocabulary, the myriad body plans of all living organisms are constructed; though duplicating even Nature s simpler designs has required great ingenuity. The basic idea of DNA origami is to use a length of single-stranded DNA as a scaffold for the desired shape. Base-pairing of complementary nucleotides causes the form to fold and self-assemble. The process is guided by the addition of shorter  staple strands,  which act to help fold the scaffold and to hold the resulting structure together. Various imaging technologies are used to observe the tiny structures, including fluorescence-, electron- and atomic force microscopy. Although DNA origami originally produced nanoarchitectures of purely aesthetic interest, refinements of the technique have opened the door to a range of exciting applications including molecular cages for the encapsulation of molecules,enzyme immobilization and catalysis, chemical and biological sensing tools, drug delivery mechanisms, and molecular computing devices. The technique described in the new study takes this approach a step further, allowing researchers to overcome local symmetry restrictions, creating wireframe architectures with higher order arbitrariness and complexity. Here, each line segment and vertex is individually designed and controlled. The number of arms emanating from each vertex may be varied from 2 to 10 and the precise angles between adjacent arms can be modified. In the current study, the method was first applied to symmetrical, regularly repeating polygonal designs, including hexagonal, square and triangular tiling geometries. Such common designs are known as tessellation patterns. A clever strategy involving a series of bridges and loops was used to properly route the scaffold strand, allowing it to pass through the entire structure, touching all lines of the wireframe once and only once. Staple strands were then applied to complete the designs. In subsequent stages, the researchers created more complex wireframe structures, without the local translational symmetry found in the tessellation patterns. Three such patterns were made, including a star shape, a five-fold Penrose tile and an eight-fold quasicrystalline pattern. (Quasicrystals are structures that are highly ordered but non-periodic. Such patterns can continuously fill available space, but are not translationally symmetric.) Loop structures inserted into staple strands and unpaired nucleotides at the vertex points of the scaffold strands were also used, allowing researchers to perform precision modifications to the angles of junction arms. The new design rules were next tested with the assembly of increasingly complex nanostructures, involving vertices ranging from two to 10 arms, with many different angles and curvatures involved, including a complex pattern of birds and flowers. The accuracy of the design was subsequently confirmed by AFM imaging, proving that the method could successfully yield highly sophisticated wireframe DNA nanostructures. The method was then adapted to produce a number of 3-D structures as well, including a cuboctahedron, and another Archimedian solid known as a snub cube   a structure with 60 edges, 24 vertices and 38 faces, including six squares and 32 equilateral triangles.","Published: July 21, 2015"

The paper entitled NY-ESO-1 Specific TCR Engineered T-cells Mediate Sustained Antigen-specific Antitumor Effects in Myeloma by Drs. Aaron P. Rapoport, Edward Stadtmauer and Gwendolyn Binder-Scholl et al. describes the persistence and tumor trafficking, antitumor effect and safety profile of Adaptimmune s NY-ESO TCR therapeutic (ADAP NY-ESO TCR) in 20 patients with advanced multiple myeloma. The paper became available through advance online publication on July 20, 2015, and will appear in the August 2015 print edition of Nature Medicine. This is the first published study of lentiviral vector mediated TCR gene expression in humans. Novel findings include encouraging clinical responses, prolonged duration of persistence of TCR engineered cells and continued expression of the TCR on the cell surface; which is a departure from previously published studies in TCR gene therapy. In addition, high levels of IL-6 were detected, without serious cytokine release syndrome, which is in contrast to the side effects observed with multiple antibody-based CD19 immunotherapeutics to date. Clinical response rates were higher than expected for the patient population enrolled, and evidence supporting the expected mechanism of action of the TCR engineered cells was found.  We believe these are significant data for Adaptimmune and for the cancer gene therapy field,  commented Dr. Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune s Chief Medical Officer.  The trial showed that autologous transduced cells can be safely administered to patients with advanced myeloma in the context of stem cell transplantation, and that the transduced cells persist for a prolonged period of time. There was also encouraging evidence of antitumor effect which supports further investigation of cell and gene therapy in myeloma.  The publication describes results of a Phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T-cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. All enrolled patients had symptomatic myeloma with active disease, representing an advanced stage population. Five patients (25 percent) had prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and 12 (60 percent) with cytogenetic abnormalities, including seven categorized as high-risk. After autologous stem cell collection, patients were conditioned with high-dose melphalan followed two days later by autologous stem cell infusion (ASCT). Patients received ADAP NY-ESO TCR (an average of 2.4 billion NY-ESOc259-engineered CD3 T-cells) two days after ASCT. Clinical ResultsEncouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 patients (80 percent) in the study: Of the 20 patients, 14 patients (70 percent) had a near complete response or complete response, and another two had a very good partial response (VGPR) by three months post treatment. According to the authors, this compares favorably to the expected response frequencies following ASCT or double sequential (tandem) ASCT where response rates are typically less than 40 percent in patients without high risk disease. Persistence and the manufacturing methodPersistence of gene modified cells in the patients was prolonged. In this study, 19/20 patients continued to have gene marked cells detectable in blood at six months post infusion, and long term persistence of engineered cells in the peripheral blood was detectable in 90 percent of patients who reached two years follow up. Continued TCR expression was detected at two years, which suggested gene silencing was not occurring. Engineered T-cells also trafficked to sites of tumor; a majority of patients (15/20) underwent marrow biopsy for response assessment at day 100; 14/15 had detectable engineered cells. Previous studies with engineered T-cells (Burns et al., 2009; Robbins et al., 2014) reported no demonstrated persistence and expression beyond one month. The method of T-cell manufacture may be key to enabling persistence; CD3/CD28 costimulation was used to manufacture cells in this study, and as well as in CAR studies for CD19 and HIV by the coauthors, and all of these studies demonstrate long term persistence of gene marked cells. This technology induces activation of the T-cell receptor through CD3 and simultaneous costimulation to the T-cells though the CD28 receptor. This selects for younger T-cells and also helps to program them for prolonged expansion. Adaptimmune holds an exclusive license from ThermoFisher (formerly Life Technologies Corporation) for methods of expanding and activating T-cells transduced with engineered T-cell receptors (TCR), including use of the ThermoFisher DynaBeads  CD3/CD28 technology. Tolerability ProfileInfusions were well-tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), despite high IL-6 levels. The observation of safety is a significant finding; CRS and MAS have been reported as significant safety concerns in multiple antibody-based CD19 immunotherapeutics to date. This differentiated safety profile may be related to physiological signaling and/or the antigen target and expression levels. Anti-tumor activityTo evaluate antigen-specific anti-tumor activity of the engineered T-cells, RNA transcript levels in marrow specimens were quantitatively measured for NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1, as well as CD138 as a measure of myeloma/plasma cell burden. Relative to levels at enrollment, loss of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 transcripts was observed in 12/15 patients at day 100, and in 11/13 at day 180. At day 100, 3/15 patients had detectable levels of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 transcripts. Notably, disease relapse was correlated with antigen escape (loss of NY-ESO and Lage expression in 2/10 cases) or loss of engineered T-cells (8/10 patients).  These data suggest that treatment with enhanced NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T-cells is not only safe but of potential clinical benefit to patients with certain types of aggressive multiple myeloma,  said Aaron P. Rapoport, MD, the Gary Jobson Professor in Medical Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Director of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center.  This study establishes a strong foundation for further research in cellular immunotherapy of myeloma. We hope to investigate additional combination approaches to boost the durability and function of the engineered T-cells to achieve even longer and deeper clinical responses.   This is the first report of TCR engineered T-cell therapy that has shown durable persistence in patients,  said Dr. Carl June, Richard W. Vague Professor in Immunotherapy, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.  These data are encouraging for the TCR platform, which I believe will be an important technology due to its ability to target intracellular antigens. ","Published: July 21, 2015"

CARES focuses on providing innovative solutions for the monitoring of HIV and AIDS treatment in Africa. The CARES Initiative in Africa started in 2004 after Professor Debbie Glencross, a South African laboratory pathologist, found a different and less expensive way to measure a patient s CD4 count. A person s CD4 cell count must be 500 cells or less to qualify for antiretroviral treatment through the country s national program. Beckman Coulter s latest initiative expands on her work by addressing the increasing demand in Africa for CD4 monitoring. The company has developed a compact flow cytometry analyzer, the AQUIOS CL Flow Cytometer, which can be used nearer to the patient to run the assay Prof Glencross developed, but still within a laboratory environment - with protocols for standardization and assay quality as required by the country s National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS). However, the high precision  LOAD & GO  Aquios can be used in smaller laboratories and operated by minimally trained users. Previously, blood samples have had to travel for several days to reach the flow cytometry centre. Dr. Jeannine T. Holden, Beckman Coulter s Director of Scientific Affairs explained:  For the first time, a compact, laboratory instrument is available that offers high quality, fully automated CD4 counts. The rapid turnaround time and ease of use mean that doctors and patients can get results in well under an hour, and timely treatment decisions can be made.  Prof Glencross is Director and Principle Pathologist in the Flow Cytometry unit of the Department of Haematology at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa. The PLG (Pan-Leukocyte Gating) technique which she developed simplifies conventional flow cytometry techniques. Hertest, which is easy to quality control and teach to minimally trained operators, has been patented by the NHLS. Talking about the increasing demand for CD4 monitoring, she added:  We are working to empower smaller community laboratories so that they can extend the availability of PLG to meet demand while still meeting the requirements of the National Health Laboratory Service. This will enable best clinical and laboratory practice while reducing the time it takes to deliver the result.  Once samples are loaded, the Aquios CL Flow Cytometer automatically carries out mixing, cap piercing, sample preparation, and analysis. Its automated cap-piercing technology helps reduce staff exposure to biohazardous samples.","Published: July 21, 2015"

Rates of both serious AIDS-related events and serious non-AIDS-related events were significantly reduced with early therapy. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, provided primary funding for the START trial. New results appear in the New England Journal of Medicine and are being presented at the 8th International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention in Vancouver, Canada. The study s composite endpoint had two components: serious AIDS events or death from AIDS, and serious non-AIDS events or non AIDS-related death. In May 2015, the START trial investigators released their initial findings that starting antiretroviral therapy early when immune systems are healthier, without waiting for CD4+ cell counts to decline, prevented the composite of serious AIDS events (such as AIDS-related cancers), serious non-AIDS-related events and death among HIV-infected individuals. Today s findings, which draw on more than two months of additional data since that announcement, show that starting treatment early significantly reduces the risk of both major components of this combined outcome: serious AIDS events and serious non-AIDS events. Non-AIDS-related events tracked by the study included cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, liver disease, non-AIDS defining cancer or causes of death not attributable to AIDS. Serious AIDS events were reduced by 72 percent and serious non-AIDS events were reduced by 39 percent. Based on the new data and analysis, the study now reports the overall risk of developing serious AIDS events, serious non-AIDS events, or death, was reduced by 57 percent among those in the early treatment group, compared to those in the deferred group. This reduction was seen regardless of age, sex, baseline CD4+ cell counts, geographic region or country income level. Other potentially life-threatening events and unscheduled hospitalizations for reasons other than AIDS were also assessed, and results did not differ between the immediate and deferred therapy groups, demonstrating the safety of early antiretroviral therapy.  This study conclusively shows that the benefits of early therapy far outweigh any adverse outcomes, and reinforces recommendations to offer immediate antiretroviral therapy to all patients,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  Today s findings show that early antiretroviral treatment presents no additional risk of serious, non-AIDS-related disease to people taking treatment, but actually confers valuable protection against these illnesses, helping keep HIV-infected people healthier longer.  The START study, which opened widely in March 2011, was conducted by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT). It enrolled 4,685 HIV-infected men and women ages 18 and older in 35 countries. Participants had never taken antiretroviral therapy and were enrolled with CD4+ cell counts in the normal range &mdash ;above 500 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm3). Approximately half of the study participants were randomized to initiate antiretroviral treatment immediately (early treatment), and the other half were randomized to defer treatment until their CD4+ cell count declined to 350 cells/mm3. On average, participants in the study were followed for three years. Although the median age of study participants was 36 - a relatively young group of participants - the most common events observed in the study were serious non-AIDS events, including many that typically affect older individuals. The two most common individual serious non-AIDS events in the immediate and deferred groups were cardiovascular disease (12 and 14 participants with events, respectively) and non-AIDS-defining cancer (9 and 18 participants with events, respectively). To evaluate the safety of early treatment, potentially life-threatening symptomatic events not attributable to AIDS and unscheduled hospitalizations for reasons other than AIDS were assessed in both treatment groups. Rates for these events were similar in the two groups. When these events were combined with the serious AIDS and serious non-AIDS events, as an overall measure of clinical benefit for early treatment, the rate was 18 percent lower in the early treatment group, compared to the deferred treatment group.  The comprehensive evaluation of the risks and benefits of early treatment in START provides policy makers, clinicians and HIV-positive individuals a strong set of data to inform antiretroviral therapy initiation policies,  said INSIGHT principal investigator James D. Neaton, Ph.D., a professor of biostatistics at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. The study was conducted in 215 sites across 35 countries, representing a diverse population of HIV-positive individuals. Specific outcomes differed by geographic region, though the benefits of immediate antiretroviral therapy were consistent. Most of the cancers and cardiovascular disease events occurred among participants from higher-income countries in Europe, and Australia, Israel and the United States (22 of 27 cancer diagnoses and 19 of 26 cardiovascular events, respectively). Most of the tuberculosis occurred among participants at study sites in Africa (16 of 26 events), where both TB and HIV/AIDS are endemic.  The results show that early treatment not only reduces opportunistic infections, which offers a bigger benefit in lower-income countries, but it also prevents a significant amount of illness in higher-income countries as well by reducing the risk of serious non-AIDS events that consisted largely of cancer and cardiovascular disease,  said Jens Lundgren, M.D., of the University of Copenhagen and one of the co-chairs of the START study. According to the study team, these findings are subject to some limitations. The patient population enrolled in START was younger than projected and experienced fewer overall events than were originally projected in the study s design. This limited the ability to determine the effect of immediate antiretroviral therapy on specific serious non-AIDS conditions, such as the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Further follow-up of this relatively young study population may help us better understand how early antiretroviral therapy impacts the cardiovascular system,  said study co-chair Fred M. Gordin, M.D., Chief of Infectious Diseases at the Washington, D.C., Veterans Affairs Medical Center and professor at the George Washington University,  While this study was long enough for us to gather important evidence on starting therapy early, three years is a relatively short time period compared to lifelong antiretroviral therapy.

Novel findings include encouraging clinical responses, prolonged duration of persistence of TCR engineered cells and continued expression of the TCR on the cell surface; which is a departure from previously published studies in TCR gene therapy. In addition, high levels of IL-6 were detected, without serious cytokine release syndrome, which is in contrast to the side effects observed with multiple antibody-based CD19 immunotherapeutics to date. Clinical response rates were higher than expected for the patient population enrolled, and evidence supporting the expected mechanism of action of the TCR engineered cells was found.  We believe these are significant data for Adaptimmune and for the cancer gene therapy field,  commented Dr. Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune s Chief Medical Officer.  The trial showed that autologous transduced cells can be safely administered to patients with advanced myeloma in the context of stem cell transplantation, and that the transduced cells persist for a prolonged period of time. There was also encouraging evidence of antitumor effect which supports further investigation of cell and gene therapy in myeloma.  The publication describes results of a Phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T-cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. All enrolled patients had symptomatic myeloma with active disease, representing an advanced stage population. Five patients (25 percent) had prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and 12 (60 percent) with cytogenetic abnormalities, including seven categorized as high-risk. After autologous stem cell collection, patients were conditioned with high-dose melphalan followed two days later by autologous stem cell infusion (ASCT). Patients received ADAP NY-ESO TCR (an average of 2.4 billion NY-ESOc259-engineered CD3 T-cells) two days after ASCT. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 patients (80 percent) in the study: Of the 20 patients, 14 patients (70 percent) had a near complete response or complete response, and another two had a very good partial response (VGPR) by three months post treatment. According to the authors, this compares favorably to the expected response frequencies following ASCT or double sequential (tandem) ASCT where response rates are typically less than 40 percent in patients without high risk disease.  Persistence of gene modified cells in the patients was prolonged.  In this study, 19/20 patients continued to have gene marked cells detectable in blood at six months post infusion, and long term persistence of engineered cells in the peripheral blood was detectable in 90 percent of patients who reached two years follow up. Continued TCR expression was detected at two years, which suggested gene silencing was not occurring. Engineered T-cells also trafficked to sites of tumor; a majority of patients (15/20) underwent marrow biopsy for response assessment at day 100; 14/15 had detectable engineered cells. Previous studies with engineered T-cells (Burns et al., 2009; Robbins et al., 2014) reported no demonstrated persistence and expression beyond one month.   The method of T-cell manufacture may be key to enabling persistence; CD3/CD28 costimulation was used to manufacture cells in this study, and as well as in CAR studies for CD19 and HIV by the coauthors, and all of these studies demonstrate long term persistence of gene marked cells. This technology induces activation of the T-cell receptor through CD3 and simultaneous costimulation to the T-cells though the CD28 receptor.  This selects for younger T-cells and also helps to program them for prolonged expansion. Adaptimmune holds an exclusive license from ThermoFisher (formerly Life Technologies Corporation) for methods of expanding and activating T-cells transduced with engineered T-cell receptors (TCR), including use of the ThermoFisher DynaBeads  CD3/CD28 technology.   Infusions were well-tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), despite high IL-6 levels. The observation of safety is a significant finding; CRS and MAS have been reported as significant safety concerns in multiple antibody-based CD19 immunotherapeutics to date. This differentiated safety profile may be related to physiological signaling and/or the antigen target and expression levels.  To evaluate antigen-specific anti-tumor activity of the engineered T-cells, RNA transcript levels in marrow specimens were quantitatively measured for NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1, as well as CD138 as a measure of myeloma/plasma cell burden. Relative to levels at enrollment, loss of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 transcripts was observed in 12/15 patients at day 100, and in 11/13 at day 180.  At day 100, 3/15 patients had detectable levels of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 transcripts. Notably, disease relapse was correlated with antigen escape (loss of NY-ESO and Lage expression in 2/10 cases) or loss of engineered T-cells (8/10 patients).    These data suggest that treatment with enhanced NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T-cells is not only safe but of potential clinical benefit to patients with certain types of aggressive multiple myeloma,  said Aaron P. Rapoport, MD, the Gary Jobson Professor in Medical Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Director of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center.  This study establishes a strong foundation for further research in cellular immunotherapy of myeloma. We hope to investigate additional combination approaches to boost the durability and function of the engineered T-cells to achieve even longer and deeper clinical responses.   This is the first report of TCR engineered T-cell therapy that has shown durable persistence in patients,  said Dr. Carl June, Richard W. Vague Professor in Immunotherapy, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.  These data are encouraging for the TCR platform, which I believe will be an important technology due to its ability to target intracellular antigens. ","Published: July 21, 2015"

The finding comes from the decade-long HPTN 052 clinical trial funded primarily by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIH-funded HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN). In 2011, the HPTN 052 study investigators reported a breakthrough: Starting HIV treatment early, when the immune system is relatively healthy, reduced the risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an uninfected partner by 96 percent over 18 months. Based on additional data gathered since 2011, today s finding unequivocally demonstrates the enduring power of HIV-controlling antiretroviral therapy to greatly reduce sexual transmission of the virus.  The study now makes crystal clear that when an HIV-infected person takes antiretroviral therapy that keeps the virus suppressed, the treatment is highly effective at preventing sexual transmission of HIV to an uninfected heterosexual partner,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  For heterosexuals who can achieve and maintain viral suppression, the risk to their partners is exceedingly low.  The HPTN 052 trial was designed to evaluate whether antiretroviral therapy reduces sexual transmission of HIV. Beginning in April 2005, the study enrolled 1,763 heterosexual couples ages 18 or older in Botswana, Brazil, India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, the United States and Zimbabwe. Each couple included one partner with HIV infection and one without. Infected participants were assigned at random either to start antiretroviral therapy right away, while their immune system was relatively healthy, or to delay starting treatment until their immune system weakened or they developed an AIDS-defining illness, consistent with World Health Organization guidelines at the time. All participants received condoms and counseling on how to protect their partners from sexual transmission of HIV. Once the investigators reported their landmark data in 2011, all infected study participants were offered the opportunity to begin antiretroviral therapy right away, and the trial continued for another four years, concluding this spring. At the end of the study, 1,171 couples remained in the trial. Investigators report that starting antiretroviral therapy early reduced HIV transmission by 93 percent over the course of the study. Only eight cases of HIV transmission occurred in uninfected partners of HIV-infected participants who received antiretroviral therapy. Four of these infections were diagnosed shortly after the start of treatment. In these cases, the virus most likely was transmitted just before antiretroviral therapy began or right after it commenced, before treatment had fully suppressed HIV replication. The other four infections occurred in study participants for whom treatment no longer was working and the virus was replicating. Treatment failure may have occurred because HIV-infected participants did not take their antiretroviral drugs as prescribed or had an HIV strain that was resistant to one or more of the drugs in their treatment regimen. The lack of sexual transmission of HIV by virally suppressed individuals in this large study provides robust evidence that antiretroviral therapy started at any time in the course of infection can prevent heterosexual HIV transmission if viral suppression is achieved and maintained, the investigators note.  Throughout our decade-long study with more than 1,600 heterosexual couples, we did not observe HIV transmission when the HIV-infected partner s virus was stably suppressed by antiretroviral therapy,  said Myron Cohen, M.D., the study s principal investigator. Dr. Cohen is Associate Vice Chancellor for Global Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and director of the university s Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases.  These findings illustrate that treatment is an incredibly powerful tool for HIV prevention.  HPTN 052 investigators also are reporting findings about relationships between viral load, viral suppression, treatment failure and drug resistance. The researchers found that having a relatively high level of HIV in the blood at the start of therapy was associated with a longer time to viral suppression, which, in turn, was associated with both the occurrence of treatment failure and a shorter time to treatment failure. Thus, having a relatively high viral load at the start of treatment could increase the risk for HIV transmission, the scientists suggest. In addition, the investigators found that among the HPTN 052 participants who started antiretroviral therapy early but failed treatment before May 2011, those who had a higher viral load when they joined the study were likely to develop resistance to their antiretroviral drugs. Additional analysis is needed to clarify this association, according to the investigators. The HPTN conducted the trial with funding from NIAID, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Mental Health, all part of NIH, through grant number 5-UM1-AI068619. Additional support was provided by the NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group.","Published: July 21, 2015"

It is called The Elastic Network Model (ENM) and it can predict the internal dynamics of RNA molecules in nearly real time (processing takes just a few seconds). To understand RNA functioning, it is useful to know the composition of the nucleotide sequence and the three dimensional shape of the molecule as well as its internal dynamics: how the different parts of the molecule move together, which are rigid or more elastic, which are connected or independent, etc. To understand these aspects, Molecular Dynamics, an extremely accurate computer simulation method, is often used but has the drawback of being very expensive. Calculation can take days or weeks. The group, led by Giovanni Bussi of the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, in collaboration with Cristian Micheletti, also from SISSA, built an ENM alternative model based on simple rules. In the SISSA model, tens of atoms are grouped together and represented as beads. These beads are connected by springs, which maintain the structural frame of the molecule.  ""In spite of its simplicity, our model is able to predict the structural fluctuations of RNA molecules with the accuracy of more complicated models,"" explains Bussi. In tests, the ENM gave results that were almost indistinguishable from Molecular Dynamics, and therefore could be a viable alternative to that methodology. Along with Bussi and Micheletti, Giovanni Pinamonti and Sandro Bottaro, both from SISSA, also participated in the research.  In addition to the theoretical part of the work, the team also carried out a comparison with experimental data. SHAPE reactivity experiments use reagents that ""attack"" the most active nucleotides in the RNA molecule. By sequencing the molecule before and after the reaction, the nucleotides which reacted are identified, or those within the molecule with the freest mobility. In this way, the experimental technique provides information on the dynamics of the molecule. Bussi and colleagues compared predictions from the Elastic Network Model and found substantial agreement with the experimental data.","Published: July 21, 2015"

The study was led by Professor Dorit Ron, PhD, Endowed Chair of Cell Biology of Addiction, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, and was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health. Scientists found that mice carrying the Met68BDNF gene variant, which reduces the release of brain-derived neurotrophic (BDNF) factor, would consume excessive amounts of alcohol, despite negative consequences. BDNF plays a role in the survival of existing neurons and the growth of new neurons and synapses, the junctures through which cell-to-cell communication occurs. The human form of this gene variant, Met66BDNF, leads to a reduction in the normal function of BDNF in the brain and is associated with several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. In an animal study reported earlier this year, NIAAA-supported scientists found that adolescent binge drinking was linked to lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and these changes persisted into adulthood.  Genetic factors play a role in determining who develops alcohol problems,  said Dr. George Koob, PhD, NIAAA Director.  By understanding the genetic underpinnings of alcohol use disorder, we will be better able to develop targeted treatment and prevention strategies.  In the study, published in Biological Psychiatry, researchers tested the role of BDNF in alcohol addiction by creating a  knock-in  mouse carrying Met68BDNF. In this variant, the amino acid valine (Val) is replaced by methionine (Met) in a specific position within the protein sequence of BDNF, resulting in reduced activity-dependent BDNF release. These  knock-in  mice drank more alcohol, even when the alcohol was treated with bitter-tasting quinine. This suggests Met68BDNF carriers compulsively drink alcohol despite aversive consequences. The effect of the genetic mutation seemed to be specific to alcohol consumption since the mice did not differ in their consumption of other fluids, or exhibit differences in levels of anxiety or compulsive behaviors. Significantly, researchers were able to reverse compulsive alcohol drinking in the mice using gene delivery and pharmacology. Increasing levels of BDNF in the ventromedial portion of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in compulsive drug and alcohol seeking, returned the mice to moderate levels of alcohol intake. In addition, by administering a pharmaceutical compound developed to mimic the action of BDNF, researchers were also able to put a stop to compulsive drinking behaviors. This compound (LM22A-4) may have potential as a therapeutic for humans. It appears to reduce compulsive alcohol drinking without a generalized effect on motivation. Alcohol use disorder affects about 16.6 million adults in the United States. Knowing whether patients carry a gene that results in decreased BDNF function could help in tailoring alcohol prevention and treatment strategies in the future.","Published: July 21, 2015"

We have shown that the cells which turn on our immune responses to defend against, for example, infectious diseases, require a particular protein to activate them in order to function properly,  explains Dr Cristina Martin-Granados formerly of the University of Aberdeen and now at Cambridge. This protein, or enzyme, (PTP1B) effectively acts as a kind of  on switch  and if it is missing or dysfunctional in our body, we cannot mount effective immune responses to tumours or infections.  The paper describes the fine tuning of cell signals which orchestrate our immune defences, for instance when we are vaccinated against infections. Dr Alan Prescott from the University of Dundee adds:  The key switch molecule PTP1B allows the uninterrupted production of something called podosomes (which behave like feet for the cell). The cells that turn on our immune systems (dendritic cells) use these  mini-feet  to move though tissue and  home in  on a type of white blood cell called a T cell, which are essential for clearing viruses from our system. These are located at the  glands , such as those in our neck, which become enlarged when patients get throat infections, for example. PTP1B is increased in obesity and diabetics so new drugs that inhibit it are being designed as an anti- diabetic therapy. Dr Martin-Granados adds:  The work shows that this important protein in our cells (PTP1B) is a potential target for new therapies to regulate the immune system when it needs a boost as in severe infections or when it goes wrong as in cancer.

They have put the new technology to the test by printing a wireless  smart cap  for a milk carton that detected signs of spoilage using embedded sensors.Major advances over the past 10 years have enabled the creation of a wide array of 3D-printed products, including prosthetics, medical implants, toys, vehicle parts, building materials and even food. What had been missing from the repertoire until now was the ability to produce sensitive electronic components.  Our paper describes the first demonstration of 3D printing for working basic electrical components, as well as a working wireless sensor,  said senior author Liwei Lin, a professor of mechanical engineering and co-director of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center.  One day, people may simply download 3D-printing files from the Internet with customized shapes and colors and print out useful devices at home.  Polymers are attractive materials in the world of 3D printing because their flexibility allows them to be formed into a variety of shapes. However, such materials are poor conductors of electricity, and thus bad candidates for electronic devices. To get around this, the researchers started off by building a system using polymers and wax. They would then remove the wax, leaving hollow tubes into which liquid metal   in their experiments they used silver   was injected and then cured. The shape and design of the metal determined the function of different electrical components. For instance, thin wires acted as resistors, and flat plates were made into capacitors. But the question remained: Do the pieces of metal actually do anything useful? To answer that, the researchers integrated the electronic components into a plastic milk carton cap to monitor signs of spoilage. The  smart cap  was fitted with a capacitor and an inductor to form a resonant circuit. A quick flip of the carton allowed a bit of milk to get trapped in the cap s capacitor gap, and the entire carton was then left unopened at room temperature (about 71.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for 36 hours. The circuit could detect the changes in electrical signals that accompany increased levels of bacteria. The researchers periodically monitored the changes with a wireless radio-frequency probe at the start of the experiment and every 12 hours thereafter, up to 36 hours. The property of milk changes gradually as it degrades, leading to variations in its electrical characteristics. Those changes were detected wirelessly using the smart cap, which found that the peak vibration frequency of the room-temperature milk dropped by 4.3 percent after 36 hours. In comparison, a carton of milk kept in refrigeration at 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit saw a relatively minor 0.12 percent shift in frequency over the same time period.  This 3D-printing technology could eventually make electronic circuits cheap enough to be added to packaging to provide food safety alerts for consumers,  said Lin.  You could imagine a scenario where you can use your cellphone to check the freshness of food while it s still on the store shelves.  As 3D printers become cheaper and better, the options for electronics will expand, said Lin, though he does not think people will be printing out their own smartphones or computers anytime soon.  That would be very difficult because of the extremely small size of modern electronics,  he said.  It might also not be practical in terms of price since current integrated circuits are made by batch fabrication to keep costs low. Instead, I see 3D-printed microelectronic devices as very promising for systems that would benefit from customization.  Lin said his lab is working on developing this technology for health applications, such as implantable devices with embedded transducers that can monitor blood pressure, muscle strain and drug concentrations.","Published: July 21, 2015"

These findings lay the foundation for future studies to further understand the mechanisms for how the escape to the bloodstream occurs.  Dr. Hauser and his team used a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) pneumonia to examine how the bacterium uses its secretion system to inject a toxin, called ExoS, into cells. ExoS has previously been linked to a higher incidence of infections spreading to the blood. If we can understand this at a higher level of detail, perhaps we will be able to design inhibitors that can be flushed into the bloodstream or the lung of a person who has PA pneumonia and block this process. If we can block these processes, we may be able to prevent bacteria from disseminating to the bloodstream during pneumonia,  said Dr. Hauser, also a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. They collaborated with the Center for Advanced Microscopy to use a novel imaging technique to identify cells injected with ExoS. This method allowed them to uncover that ExoS was not only injected into white blood cells, but also epithelial cells that form a barrier between the lung and the bloodstream. Dr. Hauser also found that injection of the toxin occurred in specific regions which they labeled  fields of cell injection  or FOCI.  We got a surprising result, that the epithelial cells weren t randomly being injected, but they were being injected in FOCI within the lungs,  Dr. Hauser said.  Over time, we were able to show as these FOCI became larger and the cells within these injected FOCI began to die.  Furthermore, they determined that increased FOCI size was associated with enhanced disruption of the barrier between the lungs and bloodstream and ultimately the spreading of the bacteria in to the blood.  This injection of ExoS results in breakdown of a barrier between the pulmonary space and the vascular space, which allows bacteria to escape from the lungs and to gain access to the bloodstream,  Dr. Hauser said. Next, Dr. Hauser plans to continue studying the mechanism of how ExoS leads to the formation of FOCI.  This research might have implications for other bacteria that frequently cause pneumonia and can also escape from the lungs and get into the bloodstream,  he said.","Published: July 21, 2015"

Technological advancements over the last 10 years have allowed police and forensic scientists to profile crime-scene DNA from ever smaller and more challenging samples collected from fingerprints, skin cells, saliva and hairs,  says Associate Professor Jeremy Austin, Deputy Director with the University s Australian Centre for Ancient DNA. DNA profiling of human hairs is critical to solving many serious crimes but most hairs found at crime scenes contain very little DNA because it has been severely dehydrated as part of the hair growth process. This makes DNA testing of hairs a real challenge.  Through an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project , the researchers, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Canberra, set out to develop a new method that could produce better results. University of Adelaide post-graduate student Janette Edson carried out the detailed genetic analysis of hundreds of shed human hairs collected from volunteer donors.   Existing methods to obtain and interpret DNA profiles from shed human hairs are expensive and often unsuccessful,  says Associate Professor Austin, who leads the advanced human forensic identification program at the University of Adelaide.  Our research shows that we can retrieve DNA profiles from shed human hairs that contain trace amounts of DNA without compromising the accuracy of our results. Previous methods required specialist and expensive laboratories.  Lead-author Assistant Professor Dennis McNevin, from the University of Canberra, says:  Our simple modifications will allow this trace DNA to be analysed in a standard forensic laboratory with improved success rates of DNA profiling and without increased error rates.

The project will receive a total of $28 million over the next four years to test and refine clinical measures of social impairment in ASD in order to better evaluate potential behavioral and drug therapies. It is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH), the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), and others. NIH funding comes from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The effort is the latest addition to the prestigious list of projects supported by the Biomarkers Consortium, a large public-private partnership that aims to accelerate biomedical research progress. James McPartland Ph.D. of Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, serves as principal investigator. The Consortium supports research to identify disease-specific biomarkers and develop targeted technologies and treatments. Its ultimate goal is precision medicine - an emerging approach to prevention and treatment that takes into account an individual s disease-related variations in genes, environment, and lifestyle. ASD is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affects social interaction and communication skills and can cause restricted and repetitive behaviors. Approximately 1 percent of children throughout the world have an ASD, each with his or her own unique combination of symptoms and levels of impairment. It is this extensive spectrum of symptoms and severity that has proven to be particularly challenging for clinical research.  The heterogeneity in people with an ASD makes it imperative that we find more precisely diagnosed groups of research subjects so that we can objectively evaluate the clinical effects of an intervention,  said NIMH Director Thomas R. Insel, M.D.  This consortium project will develop reliable tools and measures that clinical researchers can use to assess potential treatments.  McPartland and his team will conduct a multi-site study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children, both with and without ASD, over the course of several months. Research sites include Yale University, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Washington, Seattle, and Boston Children s Hospital. The research team will begin by comparing lab-based measures of domains of social impairment to commonly used, standardized clinician and caregiver assessments of social function. Specifically, they will investigate the sensitivity and reliability of these unique measures in terms of how well they indicate changes in a participant s core social impairment symptoms over time. The researchers will then evaluate the potential utility of eye tracking responses and measures of brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) as biomarkers for future clinical trials. They will investigate how these two noninvasive and relatively inexpensive biomarker measures relate to their recently validated lab-based measures of social function. Together, these findings will lay the groundwork for ASD researchers to objectively select meaningful subgroups of children and reliably measure the clinical effects of interventions. In addition to the behavioral measures and biomarker data, this community resource will also include blood samples from subjects and their parents for use in future genetic studies. Data and resource sharing are key components of this Consortium project. All data generated in the project will be made available for other researchers to view and analyze through the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research and the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource.","Published: July 21, 2015"

As part of the name change, the Company has undergone a total brand refresh, which will see the implementation of a new visual identity and online presence to support Arquer s future plans, evolution and growth, with immediate effect. The rebranding reflects the progression of the Company s strategic focus, beyond prostate and bladder cancer into diagnostics for multiple cancers of the urinogenitary tract, including colorectal and cervical cancers. The Company has also announced that it has expanded its laboratory space at the North East Business and Innovation Centre, Sunderland, UK, from 300 sq ft to 1555 sq ft. The growth of the Company follows a  2 million ($3 million USD) investment in Arquer, in December last year, which has enabled expansion of the commercial and technical teams. The funding has also enabled Arquer to begin to commercialise its diagnostic test, the Mcm5-ELISA, which is expected to significantly reduce the number of patients undergoing invasive and costly biopsies, because it offers highly accurate diagnostic results from small amounts of body fluid. Mcm5 (minichromosome maintenance complex component 5) is a protein which only appears when cells divide, and is a marker for the presence of dividing cancer cells. Arquer s test is based on intellectual property licensed exclusively from Cancer Research Technology (CRT), the development and commercialisation arm of Cancer Research UK.Dr Ian Campbell, CEO at Arquer, commented:  This is a very exciting time for the Company. As we expand our focus into new areas we are taking the opportunity to update and strengthen how we represent ourselves, in line with our strategy. The rebranding represents our ambitions to bring our novel assay to the market, providing patients with a simple non-invasive test for cancers of the urinogenitary tract. Arquer will officially celebrate its new brand with clients and contacts at Medica 2015, 16-19th November, D sseldorf.","Published: July 21, 2015"

In this phase II trial, patients with the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL were more likely to respond to ibrutinib than patients with the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype of DLBCL. The trial was jointly conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the National Institutes of Health, and Pharmacyclics, Sunnyvale, California. Lymphomas are caused by an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells and can occur at any age. DLBCL is an aggressive form of lymphoma that grows rapidly but is potentially curable. The disease accounts for approximately 30 percent of newly diagnosed lymphomas in the United States. Several years ago, NCI scientists identified the two primary subtypes of DLBCL based on characteristic patterns of gene activity within the lymphoma cells. The discovery of these subtypes suggested to the researchers that targeted treatments could be developed for each subtype. Building on this work, the trial enrolled 80 patients with DLBCL that had relapsed or had not responded to prior treatment. All patients received ibrutinib. Tumor responses were seen in 25 percent of patients overall, including eight patients with complete responses and 12 with partial responses. For the study population as a whole, after a median follow-up of 11.5 months, the median progression-free survival (the time until the disease worsened) and overall survival were 1.6 months and 6.4 months, respectively. An analysis based on disease subtype showed that ibrutinib produced complete or partial responses in 37 percent (14 of 38) of patients with ABC DLBCL but only 5 percent (1 of 20) of patients with GCB DLBCL. Based on these results, the researchers concluded that, for future clinical trials involving ibrutinib, the ABC DLBCL gene signature could be used to identify patients who would be more likely to respond to the drug. DLBCL originates from B cells, which play a crucial role in the body s immune response. The target for ibrutinib, an enzyme called Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK), is a key component of B-cell receptor signaling. The new study provides the first clinical evidence that ABC but not GBC tumors may produce abnormal B-cell receptor signals that promote the survival of cancer cells by activating BTK, thereby accounting for the sensitivity of ABC tumors to ibrutinib.  Clinical trials such as this are critical for translating basic molecular findings into effective therapies,  said Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., NCI Center for Cancer Genomics, who co-led the study and discovered the role of B-cell receptor signaling in ABC DLBCL. Study co-leader Wyndham Wilson, M.D., Ph.D., NCI Center for Cancer Research, added,  This is the first clinical study to demonstrate the importance of precision medicine in lymphomas.  Based on this study s results, an international phase III trial of standard chemotherapy with or without ibrutinib in patients with DLBCL, excluding the GCB subtype, is being conducted by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, New Jersey, in collaboration with Drs. Wilson and Staudt. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01855750. This is the first time a phase III trial has been designed to selectively enroll patients with a particular molecular subtype of DLBCL. The study s objective is to determine if the addition of ibrutinib to standard chemotherapy can increase the cure rate of patients with ABC DLBCL. Ibrutinib has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of certain patients with several other cancers, including mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenstr m macroglobulinemia.","Published: July 21, 2015"

Carbon released by burning fossil fuels is diluting radioactive carbon-14 and artificially raising the radiocarbon 'age' of the atmosphere, according to a paper published (Monday 20 July 2015) in the journal PNAS. Radiocarbon measurements have a range of uses, from analyzing archaeological finds, to detecting fraudulent works of art, to identifying illegal ivory trading, to assessing the regeneration of brain cells in neurological patients. The new study suggests that some of these current uses will be affected over this century, depending on how much fossil fuel emissions increase or decrease. ""If we reduced fossil fuel emissions, it would be good news for radiocarbon dating,"" said the study's author, Dr Heather Graven from the Department of Physics and the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment at Imperial College London. Carbon-14 is a rare, but naturally occurring, radioactive type of carbon that decays over thousands of years. Radiocarbon dating works by measuring how much the fraction of carbon-14 versus non-radioactive carbon in an object has changed and therefore how long the object has been around. Fossil fuels like coal and oil are so old that they contain no carbon-14. When their emissions mix with the modern atmosphere, they flood it with non-radioactive carbon. In radiocarbon dating terms this makes the atmosphere appear older, which is reflected in the tissues of plants taking in CO2 during photosynthesis, and their products such as cottons. At the rate fossil fuel emissions are currently increasing, by 2050 a new T-shirt would have the same radiocarbon date as a robe worn by William the Conqueror a thousand years earlier. If fossil fuel emissions were rapidly curbed, the new t-shirt would only have the same radiocarbon age as something 100 years old, according to the study. The fraction of carbon-14 in the atmosphere decreased after the Industrial Revolution with the rise of fossil fuel combustion. But in the 1950s and 60s, nuclear weapons testing caused a sharp increase. Since then atmospheric observations show the levels have been dropping, and are now close to the pre-industrial proportions. The new study indicates that by 2020, the fraction of carbon-14 could drop to such an extent that radiocarbon dating will start to be affected. ""We can see from atmospheric observations that radiocarbon levels are steadily decreasing. How low they go depends on changes in our fossil fuel emissions,"" said Dr Graven.","Published: July 21, 2015"

This study, which is being conducted at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), will also evaluate the feasibility of conducting disease-relevant clinical assessments that could be used as endpoints in future efficacy trials in pediatric and adolescent CMD patients. Omigapil is a drug candidate in-licensed from Novartis and repositioned by Santhera for development in CMD. The study is being conducted at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) in Bethesda, Maryland, and will evaluate use of the compound in 20 ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients aged 5 to 16 years affected by either Ullrich or MDC1A subtypes of CMD. All patients have been selected, pre-screened and randomly assigned to one of the three study cohorts that are starting sequentially with ascending doses of omigapil. Following a 4-week vehicle run-in phase, each patient will receive one of three doses of omigapil (0.02, 0.08 or 0.2 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks, during which period the pharmacokinetics of omigapil will be assessed as well as the patients' respiratory function, muscle strength and motor function. To ensure the collection of as much information as possible from both subtypes of CMD, Ullrich or MDC1A, all patients have been identified and randomized prior to the first dosing. The first patient received the starting dose of 0.02 mg/kg/day, applied in a new liquid formulation developed by Santhera for this patient population. Only after an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) has assessed the pharmacokinetic and safety data in each completed cohort, dosing in subsequent cohorts will follow at ascending doses. Due to the staggered dosing of patients, the study is expected to run until the end of 2016. ""We are very excited about the start of this trial with the first investigational new drug for this group of severe neuromuscular diseases where children are affected with ultimately devastating loss of functional muscle and no treatment currently available to slow down or stop progression of the disease"", commented Carsten B nnemann, MD, a senior investigator in the NINDS Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section and Principal Investigator of this study.

Their findings, reported online in Nature Neuroscience, demonstrate that ALS patients show abnormalities in levels and processing of ribonucleic acids (RNA). More than 30,000 Americans live with ALS, a condition that destroys motor neuron cells that control essential muscle activity, such as speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. While increasing efforts are geared toward therapeutic development, an effective drug for ALS has yet to be identified, in large part because of our incomplete understanding of the disease. ""Our results using advanced, modern laboratory techniques called next-generation sequencing, allowed us to acquire a library of new knowledge about patients with ALS,"" says the study's senior author, Leonard Petrucelli, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Neuroscience on Mayo Clinic's Florida campus. Dr. Petrucelli and Hu Li, Ph.D., assistant professor of pharmacology on Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minn., led a team of investigators who carefully analyzed the RNA from human brain tissues. They found that ALS brains had numerous RNA defects, compared to nondisease brains. They also predicted molecular events that may be altered due to the changes found in RNAs involved in pathways regulating those events and that may contribute to ALS. While the researchers observed some commonalities, they also found many distinctions between the RNAs that were altered in sporadic versus C9orf72 mutation-associated cases. This suggests there may be different factors contributing to ALS in patients. The success of future therapies may need specific tailoring to the specific root cause of a patient's motor neuron disease. Furthermore, the large volume of data obtained from their study, which was deposited into a public genomics data repository, provides a wealth of information available to other researchers to accelerate ALS research. Key to the success of their study was procuring samples from individuals who generously donated their tissues for research purposes to the Mayo Clinic after their passing. Close collaborations among the Petrucelli laboratory, Kevin Boylan, M.D., director of the ALS Certified Center of Excellence on Mayo's Florida campus, and Dennis Dickson, M.D., director of the neuropathology laboratory on the Florida campus, facilitated access to these precious samples. ""Last year, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge raised a remarkable amount of money to support ALS patients and research,"" Dr. Petrucelli says. ""Without the extreme generosity of both monetary donors and patient tissue donors we could not make these strides in understanding this devastating disease."" The Petrucelli laboratory is conducting follow-up studies based on the data from this study to determine which alterations are important in ALS pathogenesis. The researchers also will study which alterations should be developed as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or as therapeutic targets that may offer hope to patients with ALS.

In cancer, however, exactly how to feed or starve a tumor has not been easy to determine. A study led by scientists at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centerhas shown that a simple molecule called 14-3-3 sigma could be one answer for explaining cancer metabolism, the chemical process by which a tumor forms, grows or dies. We know that all cancers grow by learning how to reprogram their metabolism,  said Mong-Hong Lee, Ph.D., professor of Molecular and Cellular Oncology.  But exactly how this occurs has not been fully understood. Our study showed that 14-3-3 sigma opposes and reverses tumor-promoting metabolic programs.  Lee s study results revealed new understanding about how 14-3-3 sigma   a cell cycle  controller   regulates cancer metabolic programming, thus protecting healthy cells from turning into tumor-producing factories. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that, among many biochemical effects, 14-3-3 sigma suppresses cancer glycosis, which prevents cancer s ability to convert glucose into pyruvate, a substance essential for cell growth.  14-3-3 sigma expression levels can help predict overall and recurrence-free survival rates, tumor glucose uptake, and metabolic gene expression in breast cancer patients,  said Lee.  These results highlight that 14-3-3 sigma is an important regulator of tumor metabolism, and loss of 14-3-3 sigma expression is critical for cancer metabolic reprogramming.  Lee believes that the study findings provide additional insight about the  crosstalk  between cancer metabolism and cell cycle.  We anticipate that pharmacologically elevating 14-3-3 sigma s function in tumors could be a promising direction for targeted anti-cancer metabolism therapy development in the future,  he said.","Published: July 20, 2015"

Experts have known for more than a decade that thoracic aortic aneurysms   abnormal enlargements of the aorta in the chest area  run in families and are caused by specific genetic mutations. Until recently, comprehensive testing for these mutations has been both expensive and impractical. To streamline testing, the Aortic Institute collaborated with Dr. Allen Bale of Yale s Department of Genetics to launch a program to test whole genomes of patients with the condition. Over a period of three years, the researchers applied a technology known as Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to more than 100 individuals with these aneurysms.  To our knowledge, it s the first widespread application of this technology to this disease,  said lead author and cardiac surgeon Dr. John A. Elefteriades, director of the institute. The researchers detected four mutations known to cause thoracic aortic aneurysms.  The key findings are that this technology can be applied to this disease and it identifies a lot of patients with genetic mutations,  said Elefteriades. Additionally, the testing program uncovered 22 previously unknown gene variants that likely also contribute to the condition. Using the test results, the clinicians were able to provide treatment tailored to each patient s genetic profile.  Personalized aortic aneurysm care is now a reality,  Elefteriades noted. The personalized care ranged from more frequent imaging tests to preventive surgery for those most at risk.  Patients who have very dangerous mutations are getting immediate surgery,  he said. Given that aneurysm disease is a highly inherited condition, affecting each generation, the researchers offered testing to family members of patients, and found mutations in relatives with no clinical signs of disease. The researchers anticipate identifying more gene variants over time, accumulating a whole dictionary of mutations.  In a few years, we re going to have discovered many new genes and be able to offer personalized care to an even greater percentage of aneurysm patients,   Elefteriades said.","Published: July 20, 2015"

The new research suggests it may soon have value far beyond that. In laboratory experiments, researchers at Oregon State University have developed a system to increase the bioavailability of these compounds in the body by using  copolymers  that make them water soluble and allow their injection into the blood stream, creating levels that are far higher than could ever be obtained by diet or oral intake. The resveratrol and quercetin then appear to reduce the cardiac toxicity of a very widely used cancer drug, Adriamycin. Although highly effective in the treatment of lymphomas, breast, ovarian and other cancers, Adriamycin can only be used for a limited time in humans because of its cardiotoxicity. The co-administration of these polyphenols might allow much more extensive use of this drug, while at the same time improving its efficacy and demonstrating the polyphenols  own anti-cancer properties, scientists said.  This has great potential to improve chemotherapeutic cancer treatment,  said Adam Alani, an assistant professor in the Oregon State University/Oregon Health & Science University College of Pharmacy, and lead author on the research.  The co-administration of high levels of resveratrol and quercetin, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, shows that it significantly reduces the cardiac toxicity of Adriamycin,  Alani said.  And these compounds have a synergistic effect that enhances the efficacy of the cancer drug, by sensitizing the cancer cells to the effects of the drug.  It s possible, Alani said, that after further research it could be demonstrated that use of these compounds can completely eliminate the cardiotoxicity of Adriamycin, as they scavenge the toxic free radicals produced by use of this drug. It s also possible, he said, that administration of these natural polyphenols could have value in cancer therapy by themselves, or in combination with a wider range of other chemotherapeutic drugs. Resveratrol is a natural compound found in foods such as grapes, red wine, green tea, some fruits, berries and dark chocolate, and has been the subject of dozens of scientific studies for its various health values. Quercetin, also a powerful antioxidant, reaches some of its highest natural levels in capers, some berries, fruits, vegetables and leafy greens. Although they are still valuable nutrients, these polyphenol compounds when eaten as foods or taken as supplements reach only a tiny fraction of the level that s possible with direct injection. And such injection was not possible until the OSU and Pacific University researchers adapted the use of  polymeric micelles  to help make the polyphenols water soluble, so they could be directly inroduced into the body. Such systems have been used before with other compounds, but never these polyphenols.  There are several advantages with this system,  Alani said.  We can finally reach clinical levels of these polyphenols in the body. We can load both the compounds at one time to help control the cardiotoxicity of the cancer drug, and we can help the polyphenols accumulate in cancer cells where they have their own anti-cancer properties.  This is like hitting three birds with one stone,  Alani said.  It has great potential.

This resource will provide a powerful tool for researchers to identify, in a single experiment, the genes that are important for cell growth, drug effectiveness, or other biological responses and has wide implications in the discovery of novel drug targets and identifying drug mechanisms. CRISPR technology can be used to permanently disrupt (""knock out"") genes in mammalian cells. Targeting a gene for knockout using CRISPR requires a short strand of RNA (an ""sgRNA"") that contains a region matching part of the gene sequence.  Leveraging its ability to generate complex libraries expressing thousands of sgRNA sequences at once, Cellecta plans to test multiple sgRNA designs against a wide range of genes and identify the optimal sgRNA design for gene knockout. The data obtained from testing these libraries will be used to design sgRNAs for the whole human genome. ""With this project, we expect to eliminate a lot of the current guesswork required when using CRISPR to knock out genes,"" says Cellecta's principal investigator Dr. Donato Tedesco.  ""Our project will give researchers reliable and robust reagents for genetic analysis and identification of new drug targets. We're very excited to have this opportunity to increase the utility of this new powerful gene editing technology."" Upon completion of the project next year, Cellecta plans to build a library that targets 6,500 key disease-related genes in major signal transduction pathways.

Teams of scientists from each organisation will work side-by-side in integrated teams at the Crick s world-leading centre of biomedical research in the heart of London and GSK s global R&D hub in Stevenage. The close proximity of these two sites and the institutions  complementary areas of expertise will create a fertile ground for collaborative, innovative research   exposing scientists to new ways of thinking and building capability within each organisation. Increased interactions between Crick and GSK scientists will benefit both sides, introducing new ways of working and stimulating the development of novel approaches to problems. GSK and the Crick believe that this fluid interchange of skills and ideas could lead to significant discoveries in the basic scientific understanding of human disease, which could ultimately improve the success rate for discovering new medicines. One of the greatest challenges in developing new medicines is knowing where to start: scientists still have much to learn about the underlying biology of many diseases, which makes developing effective drug discovery programmes very difficult. Improving scientific understanding at this early stage of research is fundamental to improving researchers  ability to develop innovative new treatments for patients. The GSK-Crick open science collaboration will combine the specialised disease biology knowledge of the Crick s scientists with the pharmaceutical R&D expertise of GSK scientists, opening up possibilities for scientific discovery that would not be possible for each partner working alone. Together, these world-leading researchers will conduct biological research projects focused on learning more about how diseases take hold in the body and how they could best be treated, which in turn is expected to result in increased efficiency and reduced attrition in R&D. David Roblin, Chief Operating Officer & Director of Scientific Translation at the Francis Crick Institute, said:  This truly represents a landmark agreement in open science. In the Crick we aim to have industrial scientists embedded in our laboratories and fully integrated with our existing scientific groups. Together the scientists will accelerate breakthroughs in the understanding of human health and disease. GSK is an outstanding partner to commence this effort and I am excited to see what we deliver together.  GSK s President of Pharmaceuticals R&D, Patrick Vallance, said:  As a company with deep research roots in the UK, we re enormously proud of this country s vibrant biosciences community and the cutting-edge biomedical research that takes place here. That s why we continue to invest a quarter of our R&D spend in the UK and have collaborations in place with some of the country s top research institutions, which rank among the best in the world.  The Francis Crick Institute combines some of the world s best scientific minds and promises to firmly cement the UK as a global leader in life sciences research. We re thrilled to be the first industry partner of this dynamic organisation and believe that by working alongside one another, combining our unique strengths, we ll be well-placed to make game-changing advances in our understanding of human disease, which will ultimately improve our ability to make new medicines.  In the spirit of open innovation, research findings from the collaboration will be shared with the broader scientific community, via joint publication in peer-reviewed journals. This will enable important discoveries to be applied across the research community, maximising the potential for the collaboration to progress scientific understanding and accelerate the development of treatments for patients. GSK and the Crick will contribute in-kind resources, including lab space and the scientific expertise of 20 staff to the collaboration. GSK will also provide important research tools to the collaboration, including access to its non-development compound library, key antibodies, reagents and technologies, which will be used to address key questions in disease biology. A number of projects within this collaboration exploring diseases including HIV, malaria and cancer are expected to start in 2015. This will build up to a steady state of 10-15 projects in 2016. The ongoing nature of the Crick-GSK collaboration is expected to foster strong links between the organisations, as well as providing an excellent channel for the training and development of talented staff.","Published: July 20, 2015"

They have determined that back-propagating electrical impulses serve to activate a receptor inside the cell, thereby resulting in long-term changes in the calcium response in specific neuronal compartments. The results of their study are published in the journal PloS Biology. Research findings obtained over the past decades increasingly indicate that stored memories are coded as permanent changes of neuronal communication and the strength of neuronal interconnections. The learning process evokes a specific pattern of electrical activity in these cells, which influences the response behavior to incoming signals, the expression of genes and the cellular morphology beyond the learning process itself. ""You might say that these changes define the cellular correlate of the memory engram"" says Friedrich Johenning, researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center and one of the study's two co-lead authors. ""Our work focuses on identifying physiological mechanisms through which a neuron can implement long-term changes of its response"", adds the other co-lead author Anne-Kathrin Theis. In their study the scientists succeeded in demonstrating that the spine calcium response to action potentials back-propagating into the dendritic tree can undergo long-term enhancement. Spines are small but important dendritic processes that facilitate communication between neurons. Whenever a back-propagating action potential encounters such a spine, the calcium concentration within the spines changes due to the rapid influx of calcium ions from the outside via ion channels on the plasma membrane. In addition, the intracellular ryanodine receptor gets activated, which triggers the release of calcium stored in the cell. This store release results in a long-term modification of the calcium response elicited by electrical impulses inside the spine. It should be noted that these changes are local in nature and limited to individual spines - the neighboring processes remain unaffected. ""The challenge is to now ascertain exactly what influence these spine-specific, long-term, altered calcium responses exert on the synaptic communication between the neurons. It is also important for us to establish a relationship to pathological calcium response changes occurring in the context of neuropsychiatric diseases,"" according to Dietmar Schmitz, senior author and head of the study.

The research, which appears in the journal Digital Health, could also enable researchers to leverage the rapid growth in personal genetic testing to better diagnose, and potentially treat, a wide range of diseases.  These findings demonstrate that remote recruitment and conduct of research visits is feasible and well-received by participants,  said Ray Dorsey, M.D., M.B.A., a neurologist at the University of Rochester and lead author of the study. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing, when paired with telemedicine, has the potential to involve more people in clinical research and accelerate the process of identifying the genetic causes and variations in chronic diseases such as Parkinson s   Giving clinicians the ability to recruit and assess patients remotely for research and clinical trials is a game changer,  said Emily Drabant Conley, Ph.D., a research scientist and director of business development with 23andMe, and co-author of the study.  Leveraging genetically-defined groups of patients through direct-to-consumer genetic testing combined with self-reported data and remote assessment opens up exciting frontiers in research and may allow us to do things at a scale and speed that was previously not possible.  Parkinson s is a complex multi-system disease with many known genetic  clues  and a wide range of patient experiences, both in terms of the severity and progression of symptoms and an individual patient s responsiveness to the several available forms of treatment. While researchers have been able to identify many of the different phenotypes of the disease, this variation makes the process of diagnosis and treatment a challenge.  The ideal solution would be to identify the genetic signature of the various phenotypes and understand more precisely how these different forms of the disease are manifested in terms of symptoms and what treatments, or combination of treatments, provide the most effective relief.  However, this has proven to be a highly difficult undertaking given the previous high cost of genetic testing and the logistical obstacle of having to recruit from a geographically diverse pool of volunteers in order to create a sample large enough to arrive at scientifically meaningful conclusions. Two new technologies now make this task possible: direct-to-consumer genetic testing   and the recent rapid decline in the cost of genetic sequencing   and telemedicine.  Researchers at the University of Rochester and Johns Hopkins University partnered with 23andMe, a personal genomics and biotechnology company based in California, to conduct a pilot study to determine if individuals with known genetic risk factors for Parkinson s disease could be diagnosed for the condition via telemedicine. The researchers also wanted to test the feasibility of conducting clinical research remotely.  Working with 23andMe and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Research, the researchers were able to ultimately recruit 50 individuals in 23 states who agreed to undergo a remote assessment consisting of cognitive and motor tests via a secure video conferencing developed by Vidyo. The participants also completed a survey. The study found that physicians at a single site were able to successfully and rapidly diagnose and categorize patients located across the country. The findings could point the way for new and more cost effective methods to recruit participants for clinical trials and make participation in clinical research more convenient   and potentially more inviting   for volunteers.

Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, created a remote controlled, next-generation tissue implant that allows neuroscientists to inject drugs and shine lights on neurons deep inside the brains of mice. The revolutionary device is described online in the journal Cell. Its development was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health.  It unplugs a world of possibilities for scientists to learn how brain circuits work in a more natural setting.  said Michael R. Bruchas, Ph.D., associate professor of anesthesiology and neurobiology at Washington University School of Medicine and a senior author of the study. The Bruchas lab studies circuits that control a variety of disorders including stress, depression, addiction, and pain. Typically, scientists who study these circuits have to choose between injecting drugs through bulky metal tubes and delivering lights through fiber optic cables. Both options require surgery that can damage parts of the brain and introduce experimental conditions that hinder animals  natural movements. To address these issues, Jae-Woong Jeong, Ph.D., a bioengineer formerly at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, worked with Jordan G. McCall, Ph.D., a graduate student in the Bruchas lab, to construct a remote controlled, optofluidic implant. The device is made out of soft materials that are a tenth the diameter of a human hair and can simultaneously deliver drugs and lights.  We used powerful nano-manufacturing strategies to fabricate an implant that lets us penetrate deep inside the brain with minimal damage,  said John A. Rogers, Ph.D., professor of materials science and engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a senior author.  Ultra-miniaturized devices like this have tremendous potential for science and medicine.  With a thickness of 80 micrometers and a width of 500 micrometers, the optofluidic implant is thinner than the metal tubes, or cannulas, scientists typically use to inject drugs. When the scientists compared the implant with a typical cannula they found that the implant damaged and displaced much less brain tissue. The scientists tested the device s drug delivery potential by surgically placing it into the brains of mice. In some experiments, they showed that they could precisely map circuits by using the implant to inject viruses that label cells with genetic dyes. In other experiments, they made mice walk in circles by injecting a drug that mimics morphine into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region that controls motivation and addiction. The researchers also tested the device s combined light and drug delivery potential when they made mice that have light-sensitive VTA neurons stay on one side of a cage by commanding the implant to shine laser pulses on the cells. The mice lost the preference when the scientists directed the device to simultaneously inject a drug that blocks neuronal communication. In all of the experiments, the mice were about three feet away from the command antenna.  This is the kind of revolutionary tool development that neuroscientists need to map out brain circuit activity,  said James Gnadt, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  It s in line with the goals of the NIH s BRAIN Initiative.  The researchers fabricated the implant using semi-conductor computer chip manufacturing techniques. It has room for up to four drugs and has four microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes. They installed an expandable material at the bottom of the drug reservoirs to control delivery. When the temperature on an electric heater beneath the reservoir rose then the bottom rapidly expanded and pushed the drug out into the brain.  We tried at least 30 different prototypes before one finally worked,  said Dr. McCall.  This was truly an interdisciplinary effort,  said Dr. Jeong, who is now an assistant professor of electrical, computer, and energy engineering at University of Colorado Boulder.  We tried to engineer the implant to meet some of neurosciences greatest unmet needs.  In the study, the scientists provide detailed instructions for manufacturing the implant.  A tool is only good if it s used,  said Dr. Bruchas.  We believe an open, crowdsourcing approach to neuroscience is a great way to understand normal and healthy brain circuitry.

Craig Wilson joins as Global Director of Product Development, Process and Governance, and Yvonne Middlefell has taken up the role of Global Director of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs. These new roles have been created following a series of acquisitions in recent years which has seen the evolution of EKF from a specialist manufacturer of a small range of analyzers with niches in diabetes, sports medicine and blood banks, to a global business with expertise across three core divisions: Point-of-Care, Central Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics. Building on a leadership team overseeing EKF s new product pipeline, Craig and Yvonne s new roles will help to ensure the continued and efficient delivery of new quality products from this expanding IVD business. Craig has more than 20 years  experience across Pharma, Consumer and Medical Devices industries and joins from Johnson & Johnson where he held leadership positions in new product development, portfolio and program management. He will work closely with EKF s Chief Technology Officer, Tito Bacarese-Hamilton, to bring process standardization and improvements for the effective delivery of EKF s new product portfolio. Yvonne will provide leadership to the Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs organization across EKF and will champion the integration of the QA/RA function. This in turn will ensure best practice and keep the organization abreast of the latest regulatory intelligence to support the rapid introduction of new products. Yvonne holds 26 years of Global RA experience having worked in a number of key multinational IVD and medical device corporations. Prior to joining EKF, she worked as an Executive Director at NSF Health Sciences Ltd. In addition to creating the new roles bringing structure and discipline in product development governance as the company continues to grow, EKF has also restructured its organization into the three aforementioned divisions of the IVD sector. These are further segmented into key markets; for example, the Point-of-Care division is made up of: Hematology; Diabetes Care; and Maternal and Women s Health. Each of these business units are overseen by an experienced director. For example, holding over 20 years  experience in international medical technology companies, Karin Dahllof has recently joined EKF from CellaVision as EKF s Business Unit Director for Hematology.  It is essential to have the right structure and people in place so that we are able to deliver the products and services that satisfy our customers,  commented Julian Baines, EKF Diagnostics CEO.  It is also crucial that we have a strong understanding of the regulations that guide new product introductions. For example, several of the key regulations that affect Medical Devices and IVD products are due to change this year. These changes will have far reaching implications for the industry and EKF as a whole. An early understanding of the pending changes coupled with good planning can ensure that we remain successful and in a state of compliance. ","Published: July 18, 2015"

And it comes through in his voice when talking about the complex set of variables--water speed, temperature and wind--that come into play when letting a cast fly. The words flow fast and smooth, which is no small feat for someone who has stuttered since the age of four and endured teasing and bullying most of his life. ""For a long time, it brought a deep sense of shame into my life that I had this speech struggle that I couldn't get over,"" he says. Getting over it was important, especially given Sesink's calling as a full-time pastor, a role that requires extensive communication skills. He took action by undergoing intensive treatment at the University of Alberta's Institute for Stuttering Treatment and Research (ISTAR), and now that he's achieved remarkable results he is working hard to maintain his fluency. That's where fly fishing comes in. Sesink is one of ISTAR's first clients to undergo video self-modelling, or VSM, a form of treatment that involves watching videos of oneself speaking fluently. Athletes use VSM all the time to practise skills and acquire behavior, and the technique has been used clinically to treat Tourette syndrome and depression, and improve communication skills in children with autism. For the first time in North America, researchers at ISTAR are using VSM as another treatment approach for stuttering with adults. Results from a recent pilot study showed VSM helped reduce stuttering frequency in clients who had experienced relapse after therapy. Just like any behaviour change, such as exercising or starting a new diet regime, relapse can be a concern with stuttering, said study co-author Marilyn Langevin, ISTAR's director of research. VSM is a tool that can help manage those relapses and build confidence along the way. ""It's hard to keep the motivation going, and video self-modelling helps clients see themselves perform the behavior in a very confident, successful way,"" said Langevin. ""It builds their belief and their ability to do it and helps with motivation."" The pilot study was conducted by Jessica Harasym, a speech-language pathologist with ISTAR who holds the Elks and Royal Purple Clinical Chair, in collaboration with Langevin and former ISTAR executive director Deborah Kully. Their findings were published in the Journal of Fluency Disorders. For the study, participant videos were recorded post-treatment when their fluency skills--breathing techniques, how to start their voice, or move forward in speech--were at their peak, explained Harasym. Participants were required to watch their videos at least twice a week. And the more they viewed, the better the results were, with a decrease in syllables stuttered and participants reporting their own perceptions that VSM helps in personal and professional situations, she said. ""This gave us some really useful information that we are now applying to our clinical practice and will help with designing follow-up studies as well."" ""ISTAR is world-renowned for our innovative evidence-to-care approach to stuttering treatment,"" added ISTAR executive director Deryk Beal. ""Video self-modelling is an exciting opportunity to further improve the long-term support of our clients' fluency outside the confines of the clinic."" Though his fluency has greatly improved since coming to ISTAR, Sesink says he has bumpy moments when tired, stressed or surrounded by lots of people. He sees VSM as an important tool to maintain his forward momentum. ""My speech isn't perfect. There are still many times when I stutter, but I've become okay with it and have realized that it's part of my experience,"" he said.

When a person suffers neurological damage to their spinal cord, the tissues surrounding the injury site can die. But one of the body's defense mechanisms is the regeneration and migration of a type of support cell -- called Schwann cells -- to the injury. Those cells, as has been discovered in recent years, help myelinate -- or cover -- nerve axons where the injury has occurred, which promotes the recovery of some of the spinal cord's function. Yao, a biological sciences assistant professor, is studying how electrical signals can aim those cells directly to the injury site. His research, he hopes, will open new doors for the medical field to use electrical fields in the treatment of neural injuries. ""Electrical signal is a kind of ignored approach that may generate significant biological function in neural regeneration,"" Yao says. Yao's research studies the molecular mechanism of cell migration in electric fields using next-generation RNA sequencing to look at the signaling pathways that regulate cell migration. So far, he has discovered that the precision of the cell migration toward the injury increased significantly as the strength of the electrical field increased. The electrical field did not, however, change the speed at which the cells moved. Still, Yao's early findings suggest that the use of electrical fields in cell migration could become a burgeoning area of study in regenerative medicine. ""Our work has implications for central nervous system repair, and the application of an electrical field may assist with that,"" Yao says.

When a region of the brain has been activated, blood flow increases and oxygenation rises. By observing variations in blood flow with the help of non-invasive imaging, it is possible to determine which regions are at work at a given point in time and how they work together. On the basis of this principle, researchers Isik Karahanoglu and Dimitri Van De Ville have managed to visualize the different activation regions of the brain. They combined a new modeling technique and a medical imaging technique in a project bridging Ecole Polytechnique F d rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Geneva (UNIGE). The research, published in Nature Communications, provides new insights into how the brain organizes itself, and sets the stage for early diagnosis of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, in which these networks break down. In most brain-related disorders, several neural networks -- rather than an isolated region -- break down. Understanding how the regions interact provides insight into how these disorders work. There is already an imaging technique called ""functional magnetic resonance imaging"" (fMRI), which records variations in blood flow. But this process has its flaws. Thanks to a complex computational method, the researchers were able to clean up the imperfect signals obtained from fMRI and get a precise and dynamic picture of blood flow in the brain. They can see which regions of the brain are activated in an explicit ""on"" or ""off"" mode. ""Imagine taking pictures of a rainbow-coloured windmill that is turning very fast. With the old technique, the colours are fuzzy and run together,"" said Van De Ville. ""With our method we can clearly see the border between each colour on each photo."" Similarly, the dynamic map shows which regions activate simultaneously in the brain and where they are located. To identify the regions that work together, the tests were done on healthy, non-stimulated subjects. Even when in a state of 'rest' and not being used, a patient's brain has regions that are constantly activating and deactivating. ""The patient must not do anything once in the MRI machine. The data are thus not distorted by the stress or fatigue that stimulation or a task could cause,"" said Karahanoglu. In all, the researchers identified 13 main networks, i.e. those that send out the strongest signals. On average, four of these networks were active at the same time. ""Until now, we thought the regions took turns activating, and that they did so with little coordination,"" added Van De Ville. The next step consists in using this technique to diagnose neurological disorders. Alzheimer disease, for example shows deterioration in brain networks even when clinical symptoms are undetectable or negligible. Using fMRI to detect, as early as possible, cases that are most likely to develop into Alzheimer's would improve drug administration. Drugs currently in development could then be administered during the phase in which they would be most effective. Research along these lines is underway in collaboration with other neuroscience and clinical teams. Isik Karahanoglu, who is currently a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, is also applying the technique to better understand alterations in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Eating too much sugar is often seen as a personal weakness. However, our work suggests that part of what determines our perception of sweetness is inborn in our genetic makeup,  said study author Danielle Reed, PhD, a behavioral geneticist at Monell.  Just as people born with a poor sense of hearing may need to turn up the volume to hear the radio, people born with weak sweet taste may need an extra teaspoon of sugar in their coffee to get the same sweet punch.  In the study, published in Twin Research and Human Genetics, researchers tested 243 pairs of monozygotic (MZ, or identical) twins, 452 pairs of dizygotic (DZ, or fraternal) twins, and 511 unpaired individuals. Each person tasted and then rated the intensity of four sweet solutions: fructose, glucose, aspartame, and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone (NHDC). The first two are natural sugars, while the latter two are synthetic, non-caloric sweeteners. MZ twins have nearly identical genes while DZ twins share only about half of their genes. Studying twin pairs allowed the researchers to determine how much influence the twins  shared genetics contributed to their perception of sweet taste intensity. The resulting data indicate that genetic factors account for approximately 30 percent of person-to-person variance in sweet taste perception. The study also revealed that those who perceived the natural sugars as weakly sweet experienced the sugar substitutes as similarly weak. This suggests that there may be a shared pathway in the perception of natural sugar and high-potency sweetener intensity. Scientists are still working to unravel the molecular processes behind how we detect the many different types of sweet molecules. Earlier studies with mice showed that there is one main detection pathway for non-caloric sweeteners and natural sugars, but also a second pathway that responds only to sugars. The current findings suggest that these two pathways might converge into a single experience of sweetness intensity. The current study also found little evidence for a shared environmental influence on sweet perception. Assuming twin pairs took part in communal meals during childhood, this result challenges the common belief that access to foods high in sugar may make children insensitive to sweetness.  Our findings indicate that shared experiences, such as family meals, had no detectable ability to make twins more similar in taste measures,  Reed said.  The next big question is if, and how, genes and early experiences interact to affect food choice.  Understanding the genetic differences that affect an individual s perception of sweetness may eventually help food manufacturers reduce the amount of sugars and sweeteners they add to food.  Even though almost everyone   consumers, physicians, and public health officials   wants to decrease the amount of sugar in our diets, right now we have no tool that has the sensory equivalence of sugar,  said Reed.  However, if we can understand why some people have weaker sweetness perception, we might be able to adjust this attribute so we could reduce the amount of sugar in foods.   The genetics of bitterness have been widely studied in past decades, but there s much less genetic information on sweetness,  said lead author Daniel Hwang, a PhD candidate at the University of Queensland, who also is affiliated with the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.  Our next steps are to identify key genomic regions shared by people who are weak sweet tasters, in the hopes of understanding their weaker perception.

Parkinson s disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions in Singapore. It affects three out of every 1,000 persons aged 50 years and above. With an ageing population in Singapore, cases of neurodegenerative diseases are set to rise. Currently, there is no cure or treatment which can slow down or stop Parkinson s disease, which affects an estimated 10 million people worldwide. This groundbreaking research was published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The multi-year research project was a partnership between Professor Kwang-Soo Kim from McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School in the United States and Associate Professor Yoon Ho Sup from NTU s School of Biological Sciences. The team of international scientists had discovered that by activating Nurr1, a class of proteins found in the brain, it protects the brain s ability to generate dopamine neurons. Dopamine, commonly known as the chemical in the brain that generates pleasurable feelings, is an important neurotransmitter that affects motor control and movement of muscles in the body. Parkinson s disease disrupts the production of dopamine neurons and progressively causes the loss of motor control. In laboratory tests, the scientists found that by activating Nurr1, the rats which had Parkinson s disease appeared to improve in their behavior and showed no signs of suffering from the disease. Assoc Prof Yoon said the team had screened about 1000 FDA-approved drugs before they found two anti-malaria drugs which worked: chloroquine and aAmodiaquine.  Our discovery brings hope for the millions of people suffering from Parkinson s disease, as the drugs that we have found to have worked in the laboratory tests have already been used to treat malaria in patients for decades,  said Assoc Prof Yoon, an expert in drug discovery and design.  Our research also shows that existing drugs can be repurposed to treat other diseases and once several potential drugs are found, we can redesign them to be more effective in combating their targeted diseases while reducing the side effects.  Professor Kwang-Soo Kim, a leading expert in Parkinson s disease, said the current golden standard of treatment is to replenish the patients  dopamine levels through medication or by using a surgical method to do deep brain stimulation using electric currents.  However, these pharmacological and surgical treatments address the patient s symptoms, such as to improve mobility functions in the early stages of the disease, but the treatments cannot slow down or stop the disease process,  Prof Kim explains.  Backed by various lines of scientific evidence, Nurr1 is known to be a potential drug target to treat Parkinson s. Despite great efforts from pharmaceutical companies and academia, no one has managed to find a molecule which can directly bind to it and activate it, except for us.  Both chloroquine and amodiaquine are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and are used treat malaria infections. Chloroquine was used in the late 1940s to early 1950s, until the malaria parasite grew resistant while Amodiaquine is still being used in Africa today. The scientists are now looking into studying more drugs which can halt and reverse the onset of Parkinson s disease. They also aim to design better drugs for the disease by modifying chloroquine and amodiaquine. The team hopes to carry out clinical trials with these modified drugs.

Applied to studies with the aim to measure metabolism in tissues under variating conditions e.g. genetics, diets and environment.  Opposed to current methods that apply statistical analysis to data sets as a whole, the proposed workflow breaks the initial data into smaller groups determined by known molecular interactions. Statistical methods can then be applied to these groups resulting in more accurate results than if the analysis had been applied to the whole dataset.This technique has been shown to improve the detection of genes related to lipid metabolism on an example mouse nutritional study that increases our understanding of biochemical fluctuations by 15 per cent. Identifying associations between metabolites, small molecules produced during metabolism, and genes is crucial to understanding processes in the cell. However, uncovering these relationships is a complex task, especially when integrating data that concern various types of molecules. Adding to this complexity is the vast quantity of data available for analysis, a result of the development of new experimental high-throughput techniques. Initially, the molecular workflow will be applied to research into the benefits of broccoli for prostate cancer, in collaboration with the Institute of Food Research. As well as being applied to studying the health benefits of flavonoids, which are plant metabolites found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, in collaboration with the University of East Anglia. By improving our capability to integrate data from various sources and identify links between metabolites and genes, this workflow will provide a more detailed diagnosis of cellular metabolism and gene expression in biological processes. Co-author, Wiktor Jurkowski, Integrative Genomics Group Leader at TGAC, said:  Knowledge gathered in molecular networks can be harnessed to improve data integration and interpretation.  Our approach, integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics data will help interpret signals measured by omics techniques to extend our knowledge of processes under specific biological conditions. Therefore, benefiting biologists in interpreting data, creating better hypothesises and pinpointing genes and metabolites involved to unravel the mechanism of interest.  This is a proof-of-concept study and we are currently working towards improving the group generation strategy for spare areas of the interactome and less annotated species.

So far, more than 100 local and national societies and healthcare collaboratives, as well as consumer groups have joined. By issuing these five recommendations, ACMG is hoping to encourage evidence-based and cost-effective genetic testing. ""As genetics and genomics continue to play an increasingly important role in all aspects of patient care, we know that patients will have more questions and we hope this Choosing Wisely list provides some helpful direction for clinician-patient dialogue about genetic and genomic testing,"" ACMG Board Member Kristin Monaghan said in a statement. At this point, ACMG tells doctors to not order a second genetic test for an inherited condition unless there is reason to question the validity of the first test result. They also advise against ordering exome or genome sequencing for patients without educating them about the possibility of secondary findings and garnering their informed consent. ACMG's policy statement tells qualified healthcare professionals to obtain written consent from patients for clinical exome or genome sequencing, explain the uncertainty and privacy issues associated with such testing, and the potential impact results could have on family members. Additionally, the group recommends analysis and reporting of variants in 56 ""highly medically actionable"" genes associated with 24 inherited conditions. Patients can opt out of analysis of this set of genes. ACMG has also issued specific recommendations on three genetic markers: APOE, MTHFR, and HFE. According to the college, APOE genetic testing shouldn't be ordered as a predictive test for Alzheimer's; MTHFR testing shouldn't be used for assessing risk of hereditary thrombophilia; and HFE testing shouldn't be ordered for patients who don't have iron overload or a family history of HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis. Maren Scheuner, ACMG VP of clinical genetics and coauthor of the ACMG Choosing Wisely List of Recommendations, noted that the group addressed these three tests because committee members considered them to be overused and because there was substantial evidence about when they should and should not be used. In developing these recommendations, ACMG garnered input from a number of its committees charged with developing guidelines, and its board considered 18 items. The board members ultimately chose to issue the five recommendations because they stand to improve quality and reduce costs related to genetic testing, the group said in a statement.

From this, they developed a network, dubbed BioPlex, that includes 23,744 interactions among 7,668 proteins. Some 86 percent of these interactions had not been reported previously. This, they noted, is the first phase of an effort to profile the entire human ORFEOME through AP-MS to generate a comprehensive map of protein interactions in humans.""Ultimately, BioPlex unveils both individual protein functions and global proteome organization,"" Gygi and his colleagues wrote in their paper. Mapping the human interactome poses a number of challenges, but Gygi and his colleagues argued that an AP-MS approach would give a good ""first-pass"" glimpse of it as the method is fairly sensitive and can determine components of multi-protein complexes. For this project, they employed high-throughput lentiviral expression and AP-MS profiling of C-terminal FLAG-HA-tagged baits representing 13,000 protein-coding ORFs from the Human ORFEOME. Each month, they expressed up to 600 baits in HEK293T cells that were then immune-purified and analyzed with a mass spec, they reported. The analysis of all the protein-coding ORFs is ongoing, Gygi and his colleagues said, noting that this analysis focuses on the first 2,594 AP-MS experiments. With an updated version of the comparative proteomics analysis software CompPASS, they sorted out interacting pairs of proteins from the background. Though each AP-MS experiment yields data on associations with one bait, when combined, the experiments sketch out a model of the interactome. Here, the researchers reported on 23,744 interactions that connect 7,688 gene products, a network they dubbed the BioPlex. When the researchers overlaid their BioPlex network onto mammalian protein complexes in the CORUM database, they found that more than a quarter of CORUM complexes were perfectly recapitulated by BioPlex while about half had 80 percent coverage, indicating that it has correctly mapped the interactome. Additionally, a number of the interactions in BioPlex hadn't been previously reported. In a bid to validate those, the researchers confirmed that the protein pairs actually were localized to the same subcellular region   making it plausible that they can interact   and then calculated the assortativities of several databases and interaction datasets and compared them to BioPlex, finding that it compared favorably and exhibited a greater tendency to connect co-localized proteins. Gygi and his colleagues also mapped the BioPlex community structure using clique percolation to find 256 communities that could then be further divided into 354 communities and sub-communities. These communities typically were enriched for one gene ontology term or Pfam domain. For instance, after clique perforation, the proteasome was represented by one large community, but further modularity-based clustering grouped it into two parts that largely corresponded to its catalytic and regulatory particles and to its ubiquitin ligase complex. Other communities matched known complexes, the researchers added. As the researchers noted earlier, proteins that interact have to be found near one another. Thus, they added, the interactome reflects the subcellular localization of the proteins. After mapping subcellular localization information from UniProt onto BioPlex, the researchers calculated the enrichment of subcellular compartments among each protein's neighbors. If its partners are all in one region, then that protein likely spends some time there, too, providing some insight into its biology. Proteasome subunits, for example, were pinpointed to both nuclear and cytoplasmic regions. To apply BioPlex to a clinical issue, the researchers examined the sub-network that includes VAPB, which is mutated in some familial ALS patients. VAPB and several of its interacting partners, the researchers said, were associated with oxysterol-binding proteins and other proteins associated with membrane traffic or signaling. To validate these interactions, the researchers expressed VAPB and its mutant forms in a cell line and then performed AP-MS. From this and other experiments, they noted that the mutant form of the protein has increased interactions with some proteins like LSG1 but has decreased interactions with proteins with FFAT motifs. ""These data demonstrate the potential for BioPlex to inform and enhance focused study of individual proteins,"" the researchers said. Gygi and his colleagues noted, though, that as BioPlex is based on a single cell type, protein interactions could vary in other lineages. ""Thus, the network is best viewed as a framework that can be used for hypothesis generation and for design and interpretation of targeted studies that address dynamic and genetic underpinnings of individual networks, as illustrated through our quantitative analysis of the VAPB complex,"" they added.","Published: July 17, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-novel-drug-to-fight-malaria-186612,A Novel Drug to FIght Malaria An international team of scientists has announced that a new compound to fight malaria is ready for human trials  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. They have shown that this compound is the first to cripple a critical protein that the malaria parasite needs to survive at different stages of its complex life cycle, and is suitable for clinical tests in humans.The team s efforts stem from new, streamlined processes to identify and optimize chemical compounds that show promise against malaria parasites. The scientists in this international partnership   spanning 20 institutions on three continents   pooled their collective expertise to accelerate the pace of discovery and validation. This novel anti-malarial drug is their first major breakthrough for use in humans.  This is the first of a new class of molecules that s going into humans,  said UW chemistry professor Pradipsinh Rathod, one of the founders and leaders of this endeavor.  Until now, everything else in humans has been variations of drugs that have been developed in the distant past.  DSM265 targets a cellular protein made by the malaria parasite. Malaria parasites rely on this protein   known by its acronym DHODH   to express their genes and copy those genes when it s time to divide. Since DHODH provides a critical function, this drug could impair the parasite at multiple stages of its life cycle, including one elusive stage when it hides in the human host s liver. Rathod s partners include Margaret Phillips with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and Susan Charman at Monash University in Melbourne. The three research groups and their recent partners in Europe, Australia and the U.S. shared information and divided tasks openly, playing to the strengths of each group. Rathod s lab at the UW was involved from the start.  All the enabling chemistry work was done here first, and all the tests on malaria parasite cells and human cells started and have continued here,  said Rathod. Since DHODH performs such a critical role in malaria cells, scientists had long sought drugs that would inactivate it. The Texas researchers studied the malaria DHODH protein, working to identify a chemical compound that would cripple it. Once they found a chemical that showed promise, Rathod s lab undertook validation, modification, and fine-tuning. With additional guidance and collaboration from advisors at the Medicines for Malaria Venture, Rathod s group altered the chemical compound to increase its potency against DHODH. They also had to ensure that the compound would not target the human version of the DHODH protein, which performs an important role in our cells. In all, Rathod s group made more than 500 versions of the initial compound and tested how well it inhibited malaria parasites in the lab. The 265th version   DSM265   showed the most promise.  DSM  actually stands for  Dallas-Seattle-Melbourne,  our three cities,  said Rathod.  We wanted to name it after our founding teams that are working really hard at each site.  Rathod and his group passed DSM265 and related compounds to their collaborators at Monash University, who tested how our human cells might modify or metabolize the compound. These experiments ensured that a drug based on DSM265 would last for a long time in our bodies   an ideal feature for a single-dose anti-malarial treatment   and would not produce toxic byproducts. They also determined what doses of the compound might be the most effective in humans. Rathod s lab also developed and performed experiments to test how well the malaria parasite might evolve to become resistant against DSM265.  We developed methods to watch the malaria parasites mutate and try to generate solutions against DSM265 in real time,  said Rathod.  And with whole genome sequencing, we can really look at the whole scene as it s unfolding in front of us.  If doctors know the conditions that permit the malaria parasite to develop resistance to DSM265, they can tailor the drug s use in a clinical setting to lower that risk. Rathod hopes that the development and discovery pipeline for DSM265 will pave the way for a faster and more collaborative drug development process in what he calls  the long war against malaria.  The project benefited from an open process, Rathod said. Researchers also transferred their patent rights for DSM265 to the Medicines for Malaria Venture, a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-supported nonprofit public-private partnership that is leading some of the clinical and field trials, in the hopes of accelerating the drug s clinical development.","Published: July 17, 2015"

But the therapeutic use of marijuana was banned in most countries in the 1930s and '40s due to a growing awareness of the dangers of addiction. The significant medical benefits of marijuana in alleviating symptoms of such diseases as Parkinson's, cancer, and multiple sclerosis have only recently been reinvestigated. A new study by Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University researchers explores another promising new medical application for marijuana. According to the research, the administration of the non-psychotropic component cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) significantly helps heal bone fractures. The study, conducted on rats with mid-femoral fractures, found that CBD   even when isolated from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis   markedly enhanced the healing process of the femora after just eight weeks. After four weeks, the fracture callus size decreased and by six to eight weeks later it hit the control level. Not only did the application enhance the healing process, but THC was not necessary to do so. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy verified the findings. The same team, in earlier research, discovered that cannabinoid receptors within our bodies stimulated bone formation and inhibited bone loss. This paves the way for the future use of cannabinoid drugs to combat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. ""The clinical potential of cannabinoid-related compounds is simply undeniable at this point,"" said Dr. Gabet. ""While there is still a lot of work to be done to develop appropriate therapies, it is clear that it is possible to detach a clinical therapy objective from the psychoactivity of cannabis. CBD, the principal agent in our study, is primarily anti-inflammatory and has no psychoactivity."" According to Dr. Gabet, our bodies are equipped with a cannabinoid system, which regulates both vital and non-vital systems. ""We only respond to cannabis because we are built with intrinsic compounds and receptors that can also be activated by compounds in the cannabis plant,"" he said. The researchers found that the skeleton itself is regulated by cannabinoids. Even the addition of a non-psychogenic compound acting outside of the brain can affect the skeleton. ""We found that CBD alone makes bones stronger during healing, enhancing the maturation of the collagenous matrix, which provides the basis for new mineralization of bone tissue,"" said Dr. Gabet. ""After being treated with CBD, the healed bone will be harder to break in the future."" The researchers injected one group of rats with CBD alone and another with a combination of CBD and THC. After evaluating the administration of THC and CBD together in the rats, they found CBD alone provided the necessary therapeutic stimulus. ""We found CBD alone to be sufficiently effective in enhancing fracture healing,"" said Dr. Gabet. ""Other studies have also shown CBD to be a safe agent, which leads us to believe we should continue this line of study in clinical trials to assess its usefulness in improving human fracture healing.""","Published: July 17, 2015"

Many areas of fundamental research are interested in graphene owing to its exceptional characteristics. It is made of one layer of carbon atoms, which makes it light and sturdy, and it is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Despite its apparently limitless potential, however, few applications have been demonstrated to date. Scientists at EPFL s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory (BIOS) together with researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO, Spain) have now added another one. They have harnessed graphene s unique optical and electronic properties to develop a reconfigurable highly sensitive molecule sensor. Focusing light to improve sensing  The researchers used graphene to improve on a well- known molecule- detection method: infrared absorption spectroscopy. In the standard method, light is used to excite the molecules, which vibrate differently depending on their nature. It can be compared to a guitar string, which makes different sounds depending on its length. By virtue of this vibration, the molecules reveal their presence and even their identity. This  signature  can be  read  in the reflected light.  This method is not effective, however, in detecting nanometrically- sized molecules. The wavelength of the infrared photon directed at a molecule is around 6 microns (6,000 nanometres   0.006 millimeters), while the target measures only a few nanometres (about 0.000001 mm). It is very challenging to detect the vibration of such a small molecule in reflected light.  There is where graphene comes in. If given the correct geometry, the graphene is able to focus the light on a precise spot on its surface and  hear  the vibration of a nanometric molecule that is attached to it.  We first pattern nanostructures on the graphene surface by bombarding it with electron beams and etching it with oxygen ions,  said Daniel Rodrigo, co author of the publication.  When the light arrives, the electrons in graphene nanostructures begin to oscillate. This phenomenon, known as  localized surface plasmon resonance,  serves to concentrate light into tiny spots, which are comparable with the dimensions of the target molecules. It is then possible to detect nanometric structures.  Reconfiguring graphene in real time to see the molecule s structure There is more to it. In addition to identifying the presence of nanometric molecules, this process can also reveal the nature of the bonds connecting the atoms that the molecule is composed of. When a molecule vibrates, it does not give off only one type of ""sound."" It produces a whole range of vibrations, which are generated by the bonds connecting the different atoms. Returning to the example of the guitar: each string vibrates differently and together they form one musical instrument. These nuances provide information on the nature of each bond and on the health of the entire molecule.  These vibrations act as a fingerprint that allow us to identify the molecule; such as proteins, and can even tell their health status  said Odeta Limaj, another co- author of the publication. In order to pick up the sound given off by each of the strings, it has to be possible to identify a whole range of frequencies. And that is something graphene can do. The researchers  tuned  the graphene to different frequencies by applying voltage, which is not possible with current sensors. Making graphene's electrons oscillate in different ways makes it possible to  read  all the vibrations of the molecule on its surface.  We tested this method on proteins that we attached to the graphene. It gave us a full picture of the molecule,  said Hatice Altug. A big step closer to using graphene for molecule sensing The new graphene- based process represents a major step forward for the researchers, for several reasons. First, this simple method shows that it is possible to conduct a complex analysis using only one device, while it normally requires many different ones. And all this without stressing or modifying the biological sample. Second, it shows graphene s incredible potential in the area of detection.  There are many possible applications,  said Altug.  We focussed on biomolecules, but the method should also work for polymers, and many other substances,  she added.","Published: July 17, 2015"

Humans - along with all living organisms, including pathogens - need iron to survive: invading organisms try to highjack it from their hosts in order to thrive and multiply. Researchers at EMBL Heidelberg, and their colleagues, have now discovered that proteins responsible for helping the body maintain the correct levels of iron at a cellular level are also involved in helping to prevent this theft. These proteins form a system called IRP/IRE (iron regulatory protein/iron responsive element).  The work we ve been doing has uncovered a connection between two very important functions that are typically seen as separate: the body s innate immune system, and its iron metabolism,  explains Matthias Hentze, co-author of the paper and Director of EMBL. The team analyzed how mice reacted to an infection by the Salmonella bacteria, depending on whether they had a functional IRP/IRE system or not. Mice lacking a functional IRP/IRE system from professional immune cells called macrophages did well as long as they were not infected, but when the Salmonella bacteria were introduced, they died. This showed that the iron regulatory system was crucial for the macrophages, the target-cells for this specific pathogen, to fight off the infection effectively.  Withholding iron from an invading pathogen is an innate defence against infection,  explains Bruno Galy, former Staff Scientist at EMBL-Heidelberg and currently group leader at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ).  Our study reveals that the IRP/IRE system plays an important role in this defence.  The precise mechanisms through which the IRP/IRE system works in the macrophages will need further investigation, although the researchers have a number of theories. One theory is that the IRP proteins help the macrophages produce a molecule called lipocalin 2, which is known to block bacteria from taking up iron from its host. Another idea is that the IRP/IRE system represses the expression of a protein called ferritin. Ferritin is present in cells as a kind of compartment to store iron until it is needed. Invading bacteria get access to these iron supplies and if the IRP proteins are not present, the cell will store much more iron than required - thus providing valuable nutrients for invaders. The group now plan to carry out further investigations to find out if the IRP/IRE system is also important for other types of bacteria, and other types of infection, such as viruses or parasites. They also hope to discover if the IRP/IRE system has a role to play in other types of immune response, such as inflammation. This immune response is implicated in the progress of human diseases such as cancer or atherosclerosis so a better understanding of its mechanisms could have implications for research into new treatments. The research was carried out in partnership with Guenter Weiss and colleagues at the Medical University of Innsbruck and Ferric Fang at the University of Washington.","Published: July 17, 2015"

The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School (Duke-NUS) have announced the start of a Phase I clinical trial of novel cancer drug candidate, ETC-159. This is the first publicly-funded drug candidate discovered and developed in Singapore to advance into first-in-human trials, and will target a range of cancers. Overall, cancer is the leading cause of death in Singapore, accounting for 30 percent of deaths in 2013. Cancer has also resulted in 8.2 million deaths worldwide. ETC-159 targets a number of cancers including colorectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancers which contribute to a significant proportion of Singapore's cancer burden. These cancers are linked to a group of cell signalling pathways known as Wnt signalling, that have been identified to promote cancer growth and spread when elevated or dysregulated. As ETC-159 is an inhibitor of these pathways, it could suppress cancer proliferation and prevent cancer progression. This drug candidate therefore offers a promising novel and targeted cancer therapy that could shape future cancer therapeutic strategies. ETC-159 was discovered and developed through a collaboration between A*STAR's Experimental Therapeutics Centre (ETC), Drug Discovery and Development (D3) unit and Duke-NUS since 2009. This was based on the discovery work of Prof David Virshup from Duke-NUS, who has continued to contribute to the development of the drug candidate. The Phase I clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ETC-159 in advanced solid tumours of up to 58 patients. The first patient was dosed on 18 June 2015. Dr Benjamin Seet, Executive Director of A*STAR's Biomedical Research Council, said, ""This breakthrough, which closely follows local company MerLion Pharmaceuticals' recent success in obtaining FDA approval for one of its drugs, marks an inflection point in Singapore's biomedical sciences initiative. Despite the protracted process of drug discovery and development, I am confident that we will see more locally developed drugs in the pipeline being tested and implemented."" Prof Ranga Rama Krishnan, Chairman of the National Medical Research Council (NMRC), Singapore, said, ""The first dosing of a drug developed by A*STAR based on a scientific discovery by Duke-NUS researchers, is an example of the terrific and exciting progress that has been made when different entities come together to work on a common problem. This will lead to developing new treatments that can benefit patients in Singapore and beyond."" Prof Alex Matter, Chief Executive Officer of ETC and D3 said, ""The discovery and subsequent development of this drug candidate marks a major breakthrough in cancer therapeutics. It also demonstrates the world-class drug discovery and development capabilities we have built up at ETC and D3, complemented by valued partners like Duke-NUS. We will continue to strengthen these capabilities and partnerships to continue developing a pipeline of promising drug candidates and advancing them into the clinic."" Prof David Virshup, inaugural Director of the Programme in Cancer and Stem Cell Biology at Duke-NUS, said, ""As the drug candidate provides a targeted cancer therapy, it could potentially minimize side effects and make cancer treatments more bearable for cancer patients. This is a major milestone that was made possible by Singapore's ongoing investment in basic and translational biomedical research to address unmet medical needs. It is fitting that Singaporeans might be the first to benefit from this Singapore-developed drug."" A*STAR's ETC and Duke-NUS are the primary drivers of the discovery and development of the drug candidate. D3 joined the collaboration in 2013 to bring the project forward to achieve proof of concept in humans. D3 has obtained ethics and regulatory approval for this trial from the SingHealth Centralized Institutional Review Board (CIRB) and the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) respectively. The first two sites for the trial are the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) and the National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore.

The human brain contains about 100 billion neurons, and each of these sends signals to thousands of other neurons each second. Understanding how neurons work, both individually and collectively, is important to better understand how humans think, as well as to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury and paralysis. ""If the brain could always count on receiving the same sensory response to the same stimulus, it would have an easier time,"" said neuroscientist Xaq Pitkow, lead author of a new study this week in Neuron. ""But noise is always there in the brain: studies have repeatedly shown that neurons give a variety of responses to the same stimulus."" Pitkow, assistant professor of neuroscience at Baylor and assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice, said ""noise"" can be described as anything that changes neural activity in a way that doesn't depend on the task the brain wants to accomplish. Not only are neural responses noisy, but each neuron's noise is correlated with the noise in thousands of other neurons. That means that something that affects the output of one neuron may be amplified to affect many more. Because of these correlations, it is extraordinarily difficult for scientists to accurately model how small groups of neurons will affect the way a person or animal reacts to a given stimulus. Given both these correlated responses and the inherently noisy nature of neuronal signals, scientists have struggled to explain a seeming paradox that was first observed in experiments more than 25 years ago. ""When neuroscientists first analyzed the output of individual neurons, they were surprised to find that the activity of just a single neuron sometimes predicted behavior in certain tasks,"" Pitkow said. This perplexing find has turned up in numerous experiments, but neuroscientists have yet to explain it. ""A lot of people have studied this and offered up different kinds of models that make all sorts of assumptions,"" Pitkow said. ""By integrating all of those ideas and applying some analytical techniques, we found there were two different ways this could happen."" He said one possibility is that many neurons are sharing the same information, processing it independently and arriving at the same answer. The other possibility is that each neuron is using different information and casting its vote for a slightly different answer but the brain is doing a poor job of coming to a consensus with the different votes. ""The first model is a bit like trying to find a needle in haystack, and the second is like trying to find a needle on a clean floor while looking backward through a pair of binoculars,"" Pitkow said. ""Each piece of straw looks like a needle, which makes the haystack test very difficult. On the other hand, a needle should really stand out on a clean floor, but it will be hard to find with a bad searching method."" In each case, the neurons are correlated with one other, ""but in the first instance the noise correlations can never be removed, and in the second they could and should be removed but they're not,"" Pitkow said. ""And each of these scenarios has very different consequences for the brain's code, how it represents information. In terms of information theory, if the brain has a lot of information and it is not doing a good job of using it, there are very different implications than if all the neurons are correlated and they're all informative in the same way."" To determine which of these scenarios is at play in the brain, Pitkow and colleagues developed two mathematical models, one for each scenario. The models described how information and noise would flow through the network in the two opposing cases. The team tested each model against the activity of single neurons in monkeys that were undergoing perceptual tests to measure how accurately they could perceive slight movements to the left or right. The experimenters found that some neurons predicted the animals' guesses about whether they were moving left or right. ""When we examined the output, we found that the monkeys' brains were not throwing away information,"" Pitkow said. ""They were using each neuron's information very effectively. And we also saw that even though there were many neurons involved, the guess of any individual neuron was only slightly worse than the animal's actual guess during the test. These two pieces of evidence together indicate the neurons mostly share the same information."" But if every neuron is doing the same processing, why have so many? It's an obvious question, Pitkow said, but it's beyond the scope of what he and his colleagues could address in the current study. ""We didn't explore the value of redundancy in this study, but we are very interested in that question,"" Pitkow said. He pointed out that the vestibular sensors, the part of the inner ear dedicated to the sense of balance, contain only about 6,000 of the brain's 100 billion neurons. Even those few thousand might be redundant, which would mean that the rest of the neurons they contact also are redundant. ""One intriguing possibility that we are looking into is that redundancy allows the brain to reformat information and approach complex problems from many different angles,"" he said.

Their findings are published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology -- Head & Neck Surgery. ""For some study participants, this was the first time in years that they experienced any relief in symptoms. These promising results bring us closer to developing a long-sought treatment for this condition that affects an enormous number of Americans, including many men and women who have served in our armed forces,"" said Robert L. Folmer, Ph.D., research investigator with the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research at the VA Portland Health Care System and associate professor of Otolarynology/Head and Neck Surgery in the OHSU School of Medicine. One of the most common health conditions in the country, tinnitus affects nearly 45 million Americans. People with this audiological and neurological condition hear a persistent sound -- that can range from ringing or buzzing to a hissing or white noise hum -- when there is no external sound source. The distraction can impair people's ability to sleep or concentrate and is sometimes disabling. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 15 percent of Americans experience some degree of tinnitus. Currently, there are no proven treatments available. So, patients with the condition often develop coping strategies to manage their reaction to tinnitus. Military veterans are at greater risk of developing the condition. Tinnitus is the most prevalent service connected disability in the VA health system. Study participants were a mix of veterans and non-veterans. ""We applaud the work of Dr. Folmer and his colleagues. The results of the joint National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research/OHSU study are promising for tinnitus patients everywhere,"" said Melanie West, Chair of the American Tinnitus Association's Board of Directors, the premier member-based tinnitus organization. ""We are committed to finding solutions for tinnitus and excited to see the progression of TMS clinical trials producing positive results for some patients."" To conduct this research, Folmer and colleagues, including Sarah Theodoroff, Ph.D., used a TMS system that generates a cone-shaped magnetic field that penetrates the scalp and skull to interact with brain tissue. The higher the stimulation intensity, the deeper the magnetic field can penetrate and affect neural activity. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved transcranial magnetic stimulation only for treatment of depression. All 64 participants enrolled in the study received one pulse of TMS per second to their skull just above the ear to target the auditory cortex in the brain. Participants underwent TMS sessions on 10 consecutive workdays, receiving 2,000 pulses of TMS per session. Of the 32 participants who received the ""active"" TMS treatment, 18 people found their symptoms were alleviated for at least six months. To participate in the study, patients were required to have had tinnitus for at least a year or more. A significant number of participants who had tinnitus for more than 20 years were pleased to receive some relief from TMS treatment. In light of these encouraging results, Dr. Folmer hopes to conduct a larger clinical trial to refine protocols for the eventual clinical use of TMS for tinnitus.

In people, the cells of the inner ear responsible for detecting sound and transmitting those signals to the brain form during early stages of development and can't be replaced if lost due to illness, injury or aging. Studying mice, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified two signaling molecules that are required for the proper development of a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. Without both signals, the embryo does not produce enough of the cells that eventually make up the adult cochlea, resulting in a shortened cochlear duct and impaired hearing. The study, available online in the journal eLife, contributes to the understanding of inner ear development, a first step toward the goal of being able to recover lost hearing. ""To eventually be able to restore hearing, we would like to be able to regenerate the sensory hair cells of the cochlea,"" said senior author David M. Ornitz, MD, PhD, the Alumni Endowed Professor of Developmental Biology. ""If the inner ear in birds and fish is damaged, for example, cells in the inner ear are naturally turned back into progenitor cells that are capable of replacing the sensory cells. But mammals are more complex -- with a better sense of hearing over a wider range of sounds. However, it is thought that in exchange for better hearing, we have lost the ability to regenerate sensory hair cells."" In the new study, Ornitz and his colleagues showed that proper inner ear development in mice depends on the presence of two signaling molecules called FGF9 and FGF20. Normal signaling of these molecules in the inner ear turns on at about day 11 of the mouse embryo's typical 20-day development. Over the next two to three days, these two molecules direct the progenitor cells to multiply. By embryonic day 14, the progenitor cells stop multiplying and begin to differentiate to become functional adult sensory cells. At this point, the cellular population that comprises the adult ear is largely complete, according to this and other studies. ""In mammals, including mice and people, the number of sensory progenitor cells is fixed,"" said first author Sung-Ho Huh, PhD, instructor in developmental biology. ""This number is determined by cell division or cell death in early stages of development. In mice, that's between about embryonic days 11 and 14. Once that developmental window is closed, the number of cells you have is all you get. There is no compensating for low numbers."" The hair cells of the inner ear pick up sound vibrations and transmit those signals to the brain. Hearing loss occurs when these hair cells are damaged, most often by loud noise, some types of medications and the aging process itself. According to the new study, FGF9 and FGF20 send signals to their receptors, which are located in nearby cells that surround the developing sensory cells. Through signaling to these surrounding cells, FGF9 and FGF20 promote the growth of the sensory progenitor cells. This signaling activates a feedback loop that helps to direct proper development of the cochlea. According to Ornitz and Huh, future work is focused on identifying the molecules involved in the feedback mechanism. ""We have discovered that an FGF signal is instructive in forming the cochlea,"" Ornitz said. ""These FGF signals tell the surrounding tissue to make a factor -- we don't know yet what that factor is -- but we know it regulates progenitor cell growth. And being able to grow progenitor cells, or instruct cells that can become progenitor cells to grow, is one key to restoring hearing.""

But even today, more than half a century later, the exact cause of this early abnormal growth of the head and brain has remained unclear. Now, scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have uncovered how mutations in a specific autism risk gene alter the basic trajectory of early brain development in animal models. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, focused on the gene PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog), which is mutated in around 20 percent of individuals with autism spectrum disorder and enlarged heads (macrocephaly). In new research, the team led by Scripps Florida biologist Damon Page found that mutations in PTEN, which approximate those found in a subgroup of individuals with autism spectrum disorder, lead to dynamic changes in the number of two key cell types that make up the brain--neurons and glia. At birth, neurons are more abundant than normal. Surprisingly, in adulthood the number of neurons in the brains of mutant animals is virtually the same as normal, and glia (which provide support for neurons) are over represented. ""In the adult brain, excess glia are a primary cause of the overall change in brain size,"" Page said. ""This raises the intriguing possibility that these excess glia may, in fact, contribute to abnormal development and function of brain circuitry when PTEN is mutated."" The brain overgrowth the team observed in PTEN mutant mice is a dynamic process, with the greatest increase in size occurring at birth and adulthood and the least in the early juvenile period. The team noted that this abnormal pattern of growth appears to be caused by an amplification of the normal process of brain development, where neurons are generated in over-abundance before birth and then trimmed off by a program of cell death (apoptosis), and glia are generated after neurons. ""Apoptosis is a natural phenomenon that removes unnecessary neurons during normal brain development,"" said Research Associate Youjun Chen, the first author of the study and a member of the Page laboratory. ""We find it very striking that in the brains of PTEN mutant mice, the presence of excess neurons is corrected by excessive apoptosis. After that, excess glia are made. In adulthood, the number of glial cells increases by more than 20 percent in our models."" The scientists traced these effects back to an increase in signaling through a molecule known as  -Catenin (beta Catenin). ""PTEN and  -catenin are two important molecules that control growth in the developing brain in both mice and humans,"" said Page. ""We have found that these work together in a common pathway to regulate brain growth trajectory by controlling the number and types of cells produced. Although caveats apply when extrapolating from mice to humans, this suggests that an imbalance in this relationship may contribute to abnormal brain growth in a subset of individuals with autism spectrum disorder."" Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and interests, as well as cognitive delays in some individuals. The disorder affects in approximately one percent of the population; some 80 percent of those diagnosed are male. Interestingly, Page noted that in spite of the profound effects of PTEN mutations on brain growth, the mice are largely able to adapt at the level of behavior, with the important exception of social behavior and a few other behaviors relevant to autism spectrum disorder. ""Our findings across studies indicate that it may be a multiple-hit process,"" he said. ""While abnormal growth puts stress on the developing brain, the brain works hard to compensate for that. How well an individual can adapt to an abnormal pattern of brain growth may shape their outcome in terms of behavior and cognition. The capacity to adapt may, in turn, be influenced by genetic or environmental factors."" The Scripps Research Institute   press release Page DT et al.

Researchers believe breathing may be impaired during and after seizures, without the patient's knowledge. By using electrical stimulation to activate the amygdala, a group of University of Iowa researchers has identified areas of the human brain in which breathing is controlled and, in some cases, impaired, providing an important insight into SUDEP. Their study - which marks the first time researchers have stimulated the amygdala in humans and reported loss of breathing - is published in Journal of Neuroscience. Using a research participant with medically intractable epilepsy - epilepsy which can't be well-controlled with two or more medications - whose brain was already being monitored to map the focus of seizures, researchers found that when seizures spread to the amygdala, the patient stopped breathing. That effect could be reproduced by electrically stimulating the amygdala. Strikingly, the patient wasn't aware he wasn't breathing even though he was wide awake at the time. This finding was reproduced in two other human subjects. ""Amazingly, the patient was completely unaware that he had stopped breathing,"" says Brian Dlouhy, M.D., assistant professor of neurosurgery at UI Carver College of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""It was remarkable to all of us that one of the essentials of life - breathing - could be inhibited and the patients themselves were completely unaware of this."" ""The patient just sat there, unconcerned that he was not breathing,"" says John Wemmie, M.D., Ph.D., professor of psychiatry, molecular physiology and biophysics, and neurosurgery at the UI Carver College of medicine, and an author of the paper. ""If we asked him to hold his breath for the same duration of time, it was difficult for him and he could barely do it. But when the amygdala was stimulated, he didn't even notice that his breathing had stopped."" Dr. George Richerson, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chairman of neurology, and professor of molecular physiology and biophysics, and neurosurgery at the UI Carver College of Medicine, also an author on the paper, says, ""These findings provide an explanation for why SUDEP occurs after seizures, because patients would stop breathing but be completely unaware that their blood oxygen levels are progressively dropping to fatally low levels. The lack of awareness would prevent activation of the reflex that is needed to restore oxygen levels back to normal."" The team's findings may be key in helping to decrease instances of SUDEP, Dlouhy says. ""Identifying brain areas where seizure spread interferes with breathing may help identify patients at risk for SUDEP and lead to preventive strategies,"" he says.

The research, which was published in the July 13 online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the network may have evolved in response to increasingly complex social cues.  The human brain is powerful, but even it cannot make sense of the entire sum of stimuli that bombard our senses,  said Vincent P. Ferrera, PhD, the study s senior author. Dr. Ferrera is a principal investigator at Columbia s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Bran Behavior Institute and associate professor in the department of neuroscience (in psychiatry) at CUMC.  Instead, it selects and prioritizes information based on what is needed at any given moment this is called attention. And while attention is a fundamental characteristic of human cognition, and something that we use all the time, the underlying brain circuits that give us this ability remain largely unclear.  In order to better understand these circuits, the authors compared the brains of primate and human subjects during a specific attention-seeking task. In so doing, they uncovered key clues about these so-called  attention networks : how they evolved and how they underlie human cognitive abilities and are already using this information to test what role they may play in psychiatric disorders. In the human brain, there are two main attention networks: the dorsal attention network (DAN) and ventral attention network (VAN).  The DAN is in charge of directing your attention to something specific, and when it s active, the VAN is silent,  explained Gaurav Patel, MD/PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and the study s first author.  This keeps you focused and limits your distraction. But if you see something that is new, unique, or behaviorally relevant, the VAN will switch on. This give-and-take between the DAN and VAN allows us to reorient our attention to what is most important.  In a series of experiments, first using a primate model at Washington University in St. Louis, and later with human subjects at CUMC, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activity. Before the start of a session, the subject memorized a specific target object. During the session, a stream of images appeared on various parts of a screen. The subject pushed a button when the target object appeared on the screen. fMRI technology allowed the researchers to see when various parts of the brain  switched on  while the subject performed the task. And the results were surprising.  The fMRI showed striking differences between the two species, which was wholly unexpected,  said Dr. Patel.  We were giving both the human and primate subjects the exact same task their brain activity should have been more similar. That s when we realized there was something else going on.  First, they realized that the VAN located in the right hemisphere of the human brain had no equivalent in the primate brain. They also noticed the DAN had expanded in the human subjects, and observed enhanced cross talk between the human subjects  brain hemispheres.  Taken together, these findings suggests that at some point in our evolutionary history, we evolved an additional attention network perhaps in order to better process the world around us,  said Dr. Patel. The human social world is far more complex than any of our primate relatives. It is possible this network evolved to help us understand increasingly complex social cues, such as the subtle twitch of an eyebrow, or a shift in gaze, say the researchers. Armed with this new information, Dr. Patel is now examining the attention networks of people with schizophrenia a disorder characterized in part by poor social function.  Persons with schizophrenia have difficulty expressing emotions, responding to social cues and often become socially isolated,  said Dr. Patel.  Right now we re testing whether these individuals have an impairment to how the VAN is organized or communicates with the rest of the brain. Because if they do, we could potentially tailor a treatment strategy to mitigate that impairment, and maybe even restore some level of social communication that the patient lacked.

NC State engineer Orlin Velev and colleagues have shown that silver-ion infused lignin nanoparticles, which are coated with a charged polymer layer that helps them adhere to the target microbes, effectively kill a broad swath of bacteria, including E. coli and other harmful microorganisms.As the nanoparticles wipe out the targeted bacteria, they become depleted of silver. The remaining particles degrade easily after disposal because of their biocompatible lignin core, limiting the risk to the environment.  People have been interested in using silver nanoparticles for antimicrobial purposes, but there are lingering concerns about their environmental impact due to the long-term effects of the used metal nanoparticles released in the environment,  said Velev, INVISTA Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NC State and the paper s corresponding author.  We show here an inexpensive and environmentally responsible method to make effective antimicrobials with biomaterial cores.  The researchers used the nanoparticles to attack E. coli, a bacterium that causes food poisoning;Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common disease-causing bacterium; Ralstonia, a genus of bacteria containing numerous soil-borne pathogen species; and Staphylococcus epidermis, a bacterium that can cause harmful biofilms on plastics   like catheters   in the human body. The nanoparticles were effective against all the bacteria. The method allows researchers the flexibility to change the nanoparticle recipe in order to target specific microbes. Alexander Richter, the paper s first author and an NC State Ph.D. candidate who won a 2015 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize, says that the particles could be the basis for reduced risk pesticide products with reduced cost and minimized environmental impact.  We expect this method to have a broad impact,  Richter said.

This opens up novel possibilities of using blue LEDs as a chemical-free food preservation method, researchers said.  Acidic foods such as fresh-cut fruits and ready-to-eat meat can be preserved under blue LEDs in combination with chilling temperatures without requiring further chemical treatments that are commonly needed for food preservation.  Bacterial cells contain light sensitive compounds that adsorb light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is mainly blue LED light. Exposure to blue LED light can cause these cells to die.  In this study, the team placed three major foodborne pathogens - Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium - under blue LED illumination, and varied the pH conditions from acidic to alkaline.  The team found that higher bacterial inactivation was achieved at acidic and alkaline pH conditions than when neutral.  In particular, acidic conditions were more detrimental than alkaline conditions for L monocytogenes. For E coli and S Typhimurium, alkaline conditions were most detrimental although acidic conditions were also sufficiently effective in deactivating them.  A previous study in 2013 by the same team had also looked at the effect of temperature on blue LED's ability to deactivate bacterial cells and found the antibacterial effect to be most enhanced in chilling temperatures.  ""Taken together, our two studies point to a potential for preserving acidic foods in combination with chilling temperatures without chemical treatments. This could meet the increasing demand for natural or minimally-processed foods without relying on chemicals such as acidulants and artificial preservatives to preserve food products,"" Yuk said.  The next step of the research is to investigate whether LED illumination can effectively kill pathogenic bacteria without deterioration of food products, said Yuk. ","Published: July 16, 2015"

Celsis is a leading provider of rapid bacterial detection systems for quality control testing in the biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries. Celsis s systems are principally used for product-release testing to help ensure the safe manufacture of drugs and consumer products. The acquisition complements Charles River Endotoxin and Microbial Detection s (EMD) position as a leading provider of rapid endotoxin testing and bacterial identification for biopharmaceutical manufacturing, and creates the most comprehensive solution for rapid quality control testing of biopharmaceutical and consumer products. The addition of Celsis, with its Advance II , Accel , and Innovate  systems for non-sterile applications, will complement EMD s recently introduced PTS-Micro , a rapid bacterial (bioburden) detection system for sterile biopharmaceutical applications. The comprehensive EMD and Celsis portfolio is expected to drive increased adoption of EMD s quality control testing solutions across both sterile and non-sterile applications, as clients seek a single provider for their rapid product-release testing needs. James C. Foster, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Charles River Laboratories, commented,  The acquisition of Celsis combines leading providers of endotoxin and bacterial testing and bacterial identification to establish EMD as a comprehensive provider of rapid quality control testing solutions across multiple industries. The acquisition nearly doubles the market opportunity for EMD testing products and services, offering access to the consumer products market in addition to our core biopharmaceutical market. Celsis s robust financial profile enhances the EMD business, which is our highest-growth and one of our highest-margin businesses. We expect Celsis to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2015, with a more significant contribution in 2016 and beyond.  Additional Financial and Transaction DetailsThe revenue growth rate for Celsis is expected to be in the low-double digits for the foreseeable future, with a non-GAAP operating margin higher than the Manufacturing Support segment. The purchase price implies a multiple of approximately 14x adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months through March 31, 2015. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. Based on the anticipated timing of the close, the acquisition is expected to represent approximately 1% of Charles River s 2015 consolidated revenue, and approximately 2.5% of 2016 consolidated revenue. It is also expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.05 in 2015 and $0.15 to $0.20 in 2016. The Company expects to generate modest operational synergies as a result of the acquisition, with benefits totaling at least $2 million in 2016. Items excluded from non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to include all transaction-related costs, which primarily include amortization of intangible assets and certain third-party integration costs. The acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through a combination of borrowings under Charles River s revolving credit facility and cash. Charles River will not assume any of Celsis s debt or cash balances as part of this transaction. Celsis will be reported as part of the EMD business in Charles River s Manufacturing Support segment.","Published: July 16, 2015"

The Experimental Medicine Initiative to Explore New Therapies (EMINENT) network will be coordinated by University College London (UCL) and will bring together teams of researchers from the Universities of Cambridge, Glasgow, Newcastle, Imperial College London and UCL, with GSK researchers to study the fundamental biological mechanisms responsible for a range of inflammatory diseases. It is hoped that combining the disease biology expertise of these academic scientists with GSK s drug development expertise and resources will ultimately lead to breakthroughs in understanding that could accelerate the development of innovative treatments for patients. Drug development is a lengthy, costly and risky process, with the majority of promising treatments failing in clinical trials and hence never reaching patients as medicines. This is because the biological processes that underlie many diseases are still not fully understood. By gaining a better understanding of the inflammatory process in diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and fibrosis, the collaboration aims to improve the success rate for discovering new potential treatments for these and other diseases. Through the unique EMINENT network, MRC funding of up to  8m over five years will support academic costs. This will be matched with GSK in-kind contributions, including access to a portfolio of currently available medicines, experimental compounds, screening facilities and the company s drug discovery and development in-house expertise. While GSK will retain ownership of the intellectual property covering these medicines and compounds, joint project teams of GSK and academic researchers will be able to use these as investigational tools to help answer scientific questions about human disease - which in turn could provide starting points for the development of next generation treatments for patients. The initiative aims to support up to ten experimental medicine projects over the five year period. The academic research teams that are awarded funding by the MRC will work alongside their industry colleagues at both GSK and university facilities, with a view to building a legacy of expertise in translational and experimental human research across academia and industry. It is anticipated that the network will grow beyond the first five academic partners. Information and new discoveries will be readily communicated across the network, and beyond, in a spirit of open innovation. This will help enable breakthroughs in understanding to be applied across a spectrum of diseases, maximizing the potential of the initiative to bring real benefits to patients. Minister for Life Sciences George Freeman said  Networks of biomedical researchers from hospitals, industry and universities are key to unlocking the biomedical breakthroughs that are transforming our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and developing new diagnostics and treatments for patients.  Professor Sir John Savill, Chief Executive at the Medical Research Council, said  Despite major progress made over the last 20 years in many disease areas, some hard-to-treat conditions still carry high morbidity and mortality. Addressing these challenges successfully requires close, flexible, collaboration across a range of disciplines with complementary methodological expertise and disease understanding which is why initiatives such as this are so important to the MRC. We believe this innovative approach could be applied in other areas to combine the work of academia and industry.  GSK s president of pharmaceuticals R&D, Patrick Vallance, said  At GSK, we believe that alongside the cutting-edge research our own scientists are leading, we also have much to learn from researchers outside our walls. We believe that by sharing our resources and research during the early stages of research we can stimulate innovation within the scientific community, strengthen our understanding of human disease and accelerate the development of new treatments for patients. We need to embrace opportunities to work together and share information about our successes and failures.  The MRC s EMINENT initiative is a great way for us to do precisely this, allowing us to work alongside scientists from five top UK universities to drive forward our collective understanding of inflammatory disease, and we re confident this unique approach will make us better able to develop innovative new treatments in the future.  An independent panel of experts will assess the applications submitted by EMINENT collaborators. Projects will be assessed against the same criteria as any other MRC-funded research, based on the quality of the science. An oversight group, the Joint Steering Committee (JSC), reporting to the MRC, will ensure robust governance and alignment with MRC s strategic priorities.","Published: July 16, 2015"

The first volunteers of the trial at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire le Dantec in Dakar received an initial vaccination at the start of July, with a booster vaccination one week later. While this is a short timescale for immunization, if proved successful it would provide an option to respond to an Ebola outbreak with a rapid vaccination programme. This new accelerated vaccination approach is now being tested in parallel in the UK and Senegal. Dr Egeruan Babatunde Imoukhuede, who is coordinating the Senegal trial, said: 'The current Ebola outbreak has reinforced that speed of response is crucial. Outbreak diseases spread quickly, so any vaccination approach must be able to keep up.' There were 30 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease in West Africa in the week to 5 July 2015 with transmission continuing in Guinea and Sierra Leone, and renewed transmission in Liberia. The trial uses two vaccines tested first in people at the Jenner Institute at Oxford. The first vaccination, based on a chimpanzee adenovirus (known as ChAd3), is intended to stimulate, or prime, an initial immune response. The second vaccination, using modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), is designed to boost the level of the body s immune response further. The ChAd3 vaccine has been developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and its partners while the MVA vaccine was developed and manufactured through a collaboration between Oxford University, Emergent Biosolutions and GSK and its partners. Each vaccine is based on genetically modified non-infectious viruses that include a small fragment of the Ebola virus in order to stimulate the body s immune system to fight the disease. Neither vaccine contains any infectious Ebola virus material, so it cannot cause a person who is vaccinated to become infected with Ebola. While the Jenner Institute has trialled similar vaccines, this trial uses a refined booster vaccine, explained Professor Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute: 'We are using a new MVA, which has two advantages. Firstly, it matches exactly to the ChAd3 insert, which may improve immune responses. Secondly, it was produced on a new cell line that may have many advantages for low cost large scale manufacturing. When you consider that Ebola affects some of the world s poorer countries and can spread rapidly, getting the scale of manufacturing up while keeping the cost down is key to delivering an effective response.' In Senegal, Professor Souleymane Mboup is the Principal Investigator (PI) and Head of the Laboratoire de Bact riologie-Virologie (LBV) conducting the study. He said: 'A dedicated, experienced and seasoned clinical research team led by Dr Pierre Birahim Ndiye has been set in place to work with colleagues at Oxford University for the successful conduct of this Ebola vaccine trial.' The trials will see around 38 volunteers given the vaccines in the UK, and a further 40 volunteers in Senegal, initially to check that the vaccines have an acceptable safety profile and that they stimulate an immune response. The studies aim to complete enrolment by late August. Funding The Dakar, Senegal trial is being carried out by the EbolaVac consortium, which includes pharmaceutical company GSK and research partners from the University of Oxford, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne and the Bernhard-Nocht Institute, Hamburg. The consortium has received funding from the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 666085.

But the combined effects of these changes on food and nutrition security - how much food there will be, where, when and at what price - are still unknown. To establish how environmental changes might impact the food in our shops and on our plates, a group of researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Harvard University, and University of Reading, will begin a two-year project to understand and describe the web of connections that link environment and agriculture with food availability, affordability and quality. The two-stage study will be the first to address the impact of multiple environmental stresses and to take account of other influential factors such as global food markets, underlying trends in population health and demographic factors such as population growth and urbanization. In the first stage, the group will consider how multiple environmental stresses might change the availability of different types of food for a variety of people and regions. While previous studies have focused on single paths of cause and effect - for example the impact of increased temperature on production of cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa - the new study will combine a range of possible scenarios into a single model. The resulting model will then be used to predict the real term impacts of environmental change on household food bills, diet and health in three example countries: UK, Mexico and Ethiopia. Using existing data on farming, food prices, diet and health, researchers will estimate the type, price and amount of food available in these countries and the consequences this may have on health and nutrition in different parts of the population. For instance in countries like the UK where people buy, rather than grow, the majority of their food, a rise in the price of fresh fruit and vegetables may result in low-income households relying more heavily on cheap staple foods such as cereals, which could increase their risk of obesity. Richer households might not be affected in this way - contributing to increased health inequalities in the UK. The  415,000 project will be funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of the Sustaining Health initiative, a global funding scheme to seed research into the impact of a changing world on the future of human health. Dr Alan Dangour, Reader in Food and Nutrition for Global Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Principal Investigator for the project, said:  There is potential for environmental stresses to have a tremendous impact on food and nutrition security in the UK, and worldwide. As we saw in 2008 when rising food prices resulted in riots around the globe, food insecurity also has major implications for economic and political stability. Yet at the moment there is a real lack of evidence for what those impacts will be.  This research will give us a much clearer understanding of how environmental stresses are intricately linked with the availability of nutritious food globally to enable governments support the health needs of their population. By alerting policy makers to the people in society who are most vulnerable, we hope that this study will provide the necessary grounding to prevent, or prepare for, what s on the horizon.  Dr Saskia Heijnen, Research Analyst at the Wellcome Trust, added: ""Rising demand for food, scarcity of fresh water and the threat of climate change are just some of the challenges that need to be addressed if we are to healthily sustain our growing population. We need to rethink how we manage our resources, but to achieve this we first need to understand the big picture factors that influence nutrition security and how these interact to influence the diet and health of individuals in different geographies. Only then will we be able to devise policy solutions that address the needs of everyone in our society and ensure that more people have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life.

A new University of California (UC), Berkeley study shows that sleep deprivation dulls our ability to accurately read facial expressions. This deficit can have serious consequences, such as not noticing that a child is sick or in pain, or that a potential mugger or violent predator is approaching.  Recognizing the emotional expressions of someone else changes everything about whether or not you decide to interact with them, and in return, whether they interact with you,  said study senior author Matthew Walker, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at UC Berkeley. The findings are published in the Journal of Neuroscience.  These findings are especially worrying considering that two-thirds of people in the developed nations fail to get sufficient sleep,  Walker added. Indeed, the results do not bode well for countless sleep-starved groups, said study lead author Andrea Goldstein-Piekarski, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, who started the study as a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.  Consider the implications for students pulling all-nighters, emergency-room medical staff, military fighters in war zones and police officers on graveyard shifts,  she said. For the experiment, 18 healthy young adults viewed 70 facial expressions that ranged from friendly to threatening, once after a full night of sleep, and once after 24 hours of being awake. Researchers scanned participants  brains and measured their heart rates as they looked at the series of visages. Brain scans as they carried out these tasks   generated through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)   revealed that the sleep-deprived brains could not distinguish between threatening and friendly faces, specifically in the emotion-sensing regions of the brain s anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, the heart rates of sleep-deprived study participants did not respond normally to threatening or friendly facial expressions. Moreover, researchers found a disconnection in the neural link between the brain and heart that typically enables the body to sense distress signals.  Sleep deprivation appears to dislocate the body from the brain,  said Walker.  You can t follow your heart.  As a consequence, study participants interpreted more faces, even the friendly or neutral ones, as threatening when sleep-deprived.  They failed our emotional Rorschach test,  Walker said.  Insufficient sleep removes the rose tint to our emotional world, causing an overestimation of threat. This may explain why people who report getting too little sleep are less social and more lonely.  On a more positive note, researchers recorded the electrical brain activity of the participants during their full night of sleep, and found that their quality of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) or dream sleep correlated with their ability to accurately read facial expressions. Previous research by Walker has found that REM sleep serves to reduce stress neurochemicals and soften painful memories.  The better the quality of dream sleep, the more accurate the brain and body was at differentiating between facial expressions,  Walker said.  Dream sleep appears to reset the magnetic north of our emotional compass. This study provides yet more proof of our essential need for sleep.

Post-injury outcomes vary widely, and injury severity can only explain some of this variance. Combining data from brain imaging and recording, researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that disruptions in the structure and function of the brain's corpus callosum could explain the variance in cognitive outcomes. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in children and adolescents. One of the most commonly damaged brain areas is the corpus callosum, the large band of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. Damage to this area can cause cognitive deficits that can persist for years in some children. For this study, the researchers used diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess the structural integrity of the corpus callosum in children and adolescents who had recently sustained TBI. To assess corpus callosum function, the researchers used electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to measure the amount of time it took for signals to spread from one hemisphere to the other during a visual perception task. Slower spreading times indicated poor function. The researchers found that: While both the imaging and recording data could predict cognitive function alone, combining the two data sets improved the researchers  ability to predict cognitive outcomes.  Our results indicate that data from EEG and DWI can provide biomarkers for predicting outcome following moderate-to-severe TBI,  said lead author Emily Dennis, a postdoctoral researcher at the USC Keck School of Medicine. This could help clinicians identify patients who are at higher risk for poor outcomes and for whom targeted therapies may be developed, the researchers said.

The study, published in PLOS Biology, centers on the child's ability to decipher speech -- specifically consonants -- in a chaotic, noisy environment. Preliterate children whose brains inefficiently process speech against a background of noise are more likely than their peers to have trouble with reading and language development when they reach school age, the researchers found. This newfound link between the brain's ability to process spoken language in noise and reading skill in pre-readers ""provides a biological looking glass into a child's future literacy,"" said study senior author Nina Kraus, director of Northwestern's Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory. ""There are excellent interventions we can give to struggling readers during crucial pre-school years, but the earlier the better,"" said Kraus, a professor of communication sciences, neurobiology and physiology in the School of Communication. ""The challenge has been to identify which children are candidates for these interventions, and now we have discovered a way."" Noisy environments, such as homes with blaring televisions and wailing children, loud classrooms or urban streetscapes, can disrupt brain mechanisms associated with literacy development in school-age children. The Northwestern study, which directly measured the brain's response to sound using electroencephelography (EEG), is one of the first to find the deleterious effect in preliterate children. This suggests that the brain's ability to process the sounds of consonants in noise is fundamental for language and reading development. Speech and communication often occur in noisy places, environments that tax the brain. Noise particularly affects the brain's ability to hear consonants, rather than vowels, because consonants are said very quickly and vowels are acoustically simpler, Kraus said. ""If the brain's response to sound isn't optimal, it can't keep up with the fast, difficult computations required to process in noise,"" Kraus said. ""Sound is a powerful, invisible force that is central to human communication. Everyday listening experiences bootstrap language development by cluing children in on which sounds are meaningful. If a child can't make meaning of these sounds through the background noise, he or she won't develop the linguistic resources needed when reading instruction begins."" In the study, EEG wires were placed on children's scalps; this allowed the researchers to assess how the brain reacted to the sound of the consonants. In the right ear, the young study participants heard the sound 'da' superimposed over the babble of six talkers. In the left ear, they heard the soundtrack of the movie of their choice, which was shown to keep them still. ""Every time the brain responds to sound it gives off electricity, so we can capture how the brain pulls speech out of the noise,"" Kraus said. ""We can see with extreme granularity how well the brain extracts each meaningful detail in speech."" The researchers captured three different aspects of the brain's response to sound: the stability with which the circuits were responding; the speed with which the circuits were firing; and the quality with which the circuits represented the timbre of the sound. Using these three pieces of information, they developed a statistical model to predict children's performance on key early literacy tests. In a series of experiments with 112 kids between the ages of 3 and 14, Kraus' team found that their 30-minute neurophysiological assessment predicts with a very high accuracy how a 3-year-old child will perform on multiple pre-reading tests and how, a year later at age 4, he or she will perform across multiple language skills important for reading. The model proved its breadth by also accurately predicting reading acumen in school-aged children, in addition to whether they'd been diagnosed with a learning disability. ""The importance of our biological approach is that we can see how the brain makes sense of sound and its impact for literacy, in any child,"" Kraus said.

Controlling the Cx43 expression using pharmacological approaches or gene therapy might serve as novel therapeutic strategies ameliorate neurological disorders in general and neuropathic pain in particular. The downregulation of spinal astrocyte connexin43 (Cx43) expression causes sustained neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. The inflammatory cytokinetumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediates the downregulation of Cx43 expression, which leads to decreased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 and enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission. Targeting the recovery of Cx43 function using pharmacological approaches or gene therapy might serve as novel therapeutic strategies ameliorate neurological disorders in general and neuropathic pain in particular. Spinal cord astrocytes are critical in the maintenance of neuropathic pain. Cx43 expressed on spinal dorsal horn astrocytes modulates synaptic neurotransmission, but its role in nociceptive transduction has yet to be fully elaborated. Several types of Cx have been identified in the spinal cord. Cx43 is preferentially and mainly expressed in astrocytes, and altered astrocytic Cx43 expression is associated with various neurological disorders such as the neuroinflammation observed in multiple sclerosis. However, the relationship between astrocytic Cx43 expression level and changes in pain perception is controversial. A research group from Hiroshima University investigated the effects of altered spinal astrocytic Cx43 expression and pain-related behavior following peripheral nerve injury. They found that in the spinal cord, an inflammatory event following nerve injury resulted in the release of cytokines such as TNF and induced the downregulation of astrocytic Cx43 and GLT-1 expression, resulting in increased excitatory synaptic activity.  When downregulated Cx43 expression is restored by adenovirus vector expressing Cx43 in mouse model, reversed mechanical hypersensitivity was observed,  stated Dr. Norimitsu Morioka.  In addition, downregulated GLT-1 was reversed by restoration of Cx43 by adenovirus vector expressing Cx43. It is possible that Cx43 directly regulates GLT-1 expression and function . The precise molecular mechanisms involving Cx43-mediated GLT-1 downregulation require further investigation. These results indicate the importance of spinal astrocyte Cx43 are essential for maintenance of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury and suggested modulation of Cx43 as a novel target for developing analgesics for neuropathic pain.

Ciliopathies are caused by defects in cilia, finger-like projections from cells that act as microscopic  antenna  to detect and respond to chemical changes or fluid flow outside the cell. Kidney disease, which often leads to kidney failure, is a common complication of ciliopathies and is a significant cause of childhood disease and death. One in every 1,000 people is born with a ciliopathy, which means there are currently about 30,000 affected people in the UK alone. The research was led by the University of Leeds in collaboration with colleagues from Nijmegen in the Netherlands and about 40 other institutions worldwide. Professor Colin A. Johnson, Professor of Medical and Molecular Genetics in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, said:  This research gives us the best list yet of the human genes needed to make cilia. This is an important issue in biology, but it also directly benefits patients because we can find new genetic causes for ciliopathies. We ve found some completely unexpected cell processes that are linked to these diseases which should help in the search for future treatments.  Professor Ronald Roepman, of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, added:  We confirmed that each of the genes on the list were important for cilia using an independent method. We then focused in on some of the biochemical processes that are required for a functioning cilium.

We believe it is the first example illustrating the process of a developing human heart chamber in vitro,  said Kevin Healy, a UC Berkeley professor of bioengineering, who is co-senior author of the study with Dr. Bruce Conklin, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and a professor of medical genetics and cellular and molecular pharmacology at UC San Francisco.  This technology could help us quickly screen for drugs likely to generate cardiac birth defects, and guide decisions about which drugs are dangerous during pregnancy. To test the potential of the system as a drug-screening tool, the researchers exposed the differentiating cells to thalidomide, a drug known to cause severe birth defects. They found that at normal therapeutic doses, the drug led to abnormal development of microchambers, including decreased size, problems with muscle contraction and lower beat rates compared with heart tissue that had not been exposed to thalidomide.  We chose drug cardiac developmental toxicity screening to demonstrate a clinically relevant application of the cardiac microchambers,  said Conklin.  Each year, as many as 280,000 pregnant women are exposed to drugs with evidence of potential fetal risk. The most commonly reported birth defects involve the heart, and the potential for generating cardiac defects is of utmost concern in determining drug safety during pregnancy.  The new milestone comes nearly four months after Healy and other UC Berkeley researchers publicly debuted a system of beating human heart cells on a chip that could be used to screen for drug toxicity. However, that heart-on-a-chip device used pre-differentiated cardiac cells to mimic adult-like tissue structure. In this new study, the scientists mimicked human tissue formation by starting with stem cells genetically reprogrammed from adult skin tissue to form small chambers with beating human heart cells. Conklin s lab at Gladstone, an independent, nonprofit life science research organization affiliated with UC San Francisco, supplied these human induced pluripotent stem cells for this study. The undifferentiated stem cells were then placed onto a circular-patterned surface that served to physically regulate cell differentiation and growth. By the end of two weeks, the cells that began on a two-dimensional surface environment started taking on a 3D structure as a pulsating microchamber. Moreover, the cells had self-organized based upon whether they were positioned along the perimeter or in the middle of the colony. Compared with cells in the center, cells along the edge experienced greater mechanical stress and tension, and appeared more like fibroblasts, which form the collagen of connective tissue. The center cells, in contrast, developed into cardiac muscle cells. Such spatial organization was observed as soon as the differentiation started. Center cells lost the expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) faster than perimeter cells, which are critical to the development of heart tissue.  This spatial differentiation happens in biology naturally, but we demonstrated this process in vitro,  said study lead author Zhen Ma, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral researcher in bioengineering.  The confined geometric pattern provided biochemical and biophysical cues that directed cardiac differentiation and the formation of a beating microchamber.  Modeling early heart development is difficult to achieve in a petri dish and tissue culture plates, the study authors said. This area of study has typically involved the dissection of animals at different stages of development to study the formation of organs, and how that process can go wrong.  The fact that we used patient-derived human pluripotent stem cells in our work represents a sea change in the field,  said Healy.  Previous studies of cardiac microtissues primarily used harvested rat cardiomyocytes, which is an imperfect model for human disease.  The researchers pointed out that while this study focused on heart tissue, there is great potential for use of this technology to study other organ development.  Our focus here has been on early heart development, but the basic principles of patterning of human pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently differentiating them, can be readily expanded into a broad range of tissues for understanding embryogenesis and tissue morphogenesis,  said Healy.","Published: July 15, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-cell-division-mechanism-discovered-202402,New Cell Division Mechanism Discovered Canadian and British researchers have discovered that chromosomes play an active role in animal cell division   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. This occurs at a precise stage   cytokinesis   when the cell splits into two new daughter cells. It was observed by a team of researchers including Gilles Hickson, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal's Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and researcher at the CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, his assistant Silvana Jananji, in collaboration with Nelio Rodrigues, a PhD student, and Sergey Lekomtsev, a postdoc, working in the group led by Buzz Baum of the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology at University College London. Cell division is fundamental to all life forms:  the human body develops from a single cell that divides billions of times to generate all tissue types, and some of these cells continue to divide billions of times every day throughout life. For the moment, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are incompletely understood, and it was unknown until now that chromosomes could play an active role at this step in cytokinesis. Flawless division In animal cells, division involves mitosis, the separation of chromosomes followed by splitting of the cell into two new daughter cells by cytokinesis. ""Division is a complex and robust process that is generally performed flawlessly, but when an error occurs in DNA separation or during cytokinesis, it can be a source for triggering cancer, for example,  said Hickson. It is well known that microscopic cable-like structures, called microtubules, were involved in pulling chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell during the division process.  At this time, microtubules physically separate the chromosomes via their central kinetochores while other microtubules signal to the cortex of the cell where its equator is, i.e., where division will take place,  Hickson explained. Furthermore until now, it was believed that the chromosomes only played a passive role: that they were pulled by the microtubules and didn't affect cytokinesis, but this is not the case. Chromosomes' active role Initially working with the cells of fruit flies using powerful genetic tools and sophisticated microscopy, the research team discovered that chromosomes emit signals that influence the cortex of the cell to reinforce microtubule action. One of the key signals involved that the researchers identified acts via an enzyme complex   a phosphatase known as Sds22-PP1   which is found at the kinetochores. They also demonstrated that this signaling pathway acts in human cells.  Such evolutionary conservation from flies to humans is expected for processes as fundamental as cell division,  he explained. This is what makes fruit flies such a powerful system for helping us to understand human biology. ""When chromosomes are segregated, they approach the membrane at the poles of the cell, and thanks to this enzyme's actions, this contributes to the softening of the polar membrane, facilitating the elongation of the cell and the ensuing division that occurs at the equator.  A new avenue of research The discovery of this mechanism is a significant breakthrough in advancing knowledge about the cell division process.  We have been watching cells divide for more than 100 years, but we continue to seek to understand the molecular mechanisms involved. This is important because cell division is so central to life, and to certain diseases,  said Hickson, who has devoted the last 15 years of his research life to cell biology. In fact, all cancers are characterised by unchecked cell division, and the underpinning processes are potential targets for therapeutic interventions that prevent cancer onset and spread.  But before we get there, we must continue to expand our knowledge about the basic processes and signals involved in normal cell division to understand how they can go awry, or how they can be exploited..Also different cell types in the body, and even in the same tissue, do not always divide in exactly the same way. For example, stem cells divide asymmetrically, while most other cells divide symmetrically, and we still do not understand these differences in molecular terms. With the help of robust and well-characterised genetic models, such as the fruit fly, we will get there. Ultimately, this could help the rational design of more specific therapies to inhibit the division of cancer cells, ideally without affecting the healthy cells that are dividing at the same time,  Hickson said.","Published: July 15, 2015"

Severe infections can cause necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, sepsis, or toxic shock, and around one in four people who suffer an invasive infection do not survive. Researchers at Imperial College London and clinicians at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, together with colleagues at Public Health England, noticed a sharp rise in infections caused by one particular strain, called emm89, from 1998 to 2009. To investigate why, they sequenced the genomes of bacterial samples from patients. The genetic sequences revealed a new subtype of emm89 streptococcus whose emergence coincided with the surge in cases.  Japan, Canada, France and Sweden have reported a surge in the same strain type, raising the possibility that the new variant is spreading globally.  Group A streptococcus can infect the skin or the throat, where it can cause tonsillitis. Less commonly, it infects deeper parts of the body, where it is much more dangerous. There are around 1300 to 1800 of these invasive infections each year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and health experts are increasingly concerned about periodic upsurges in both non-invasive and invasive diseases caused by group A strep. The new variant has evolved two important differences from other members of the strain: it produces more toxin, and has completely lost its outer capsule. ""The fact that it had lost its capsule was a complete surprise, because it was believed that the capsule was essential for group A streptococcus to cause invasive disease,"" said Dr Claire Turner, a Junior Research Fellow at Imperial College London who led the study.  The researchers are still uncertain about why the new variant without capsule has become so dominant. ""We know that without capsule, they stick better to surfaces, so that may help them to transmit more easily. Another possibility is that they can more easily get inside human cells, which makes them harder to treat,"" said Dr Turner. Professor Shiranee Sriskandan from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, the senior author of the study, said: ""We know very little about how group A streptococcus is transmitted from person to person. We need to look into this more deeply and think about better ways to prevent transmission.  ""This discovery was made possible thanks to the cooperation of our hospital diagnostic lab and the national reference lab, which helped us to spot a pattern locally and then study it nationally. ""Luckily, the new variant remains exquisitely sensitive to penicillin and related antibiotics. But we also need to think about whether our treatment strategies are as good as they can be.""","Published: July 15, 2015"

In the study, the shortened G1 phase resulted in much improved continuous production of mature blood cells from stem cells over a prolonged period of time. It is imaginable that the stem cell function can also be increased in the human body in the future by an acceleration of cell cycle transition kinetic. Credit: Nicole Mende The continuous supply of freshly generated blood cells is essential to sustain the function of our immune system over the whole period of our life. In fact, de novo generation of blood cells becomes pivotal after infectious diseases or high blood loss when newly generated mature blood cells are required to ensure survival of the organism. In order to cope with such life-threatening triggers, our bone marrow possesses so-called blood-forming or hematopoietic stem cells, which have the ability to re-form all the blood cells as required. This particular property of hematopoietic stem cells is also used in clinical bone marrow transplantation, in which diseased blood cells - for example leukemic cells - are replaced by healthy cells. However, the limited number of donor stem cells which can be tolerated by the recipient is still a very high hurdle for the success of such a stem cell transplantation. This is why better understanding of the function of stem cells in the body is still of particular importance in order to be able to find solutions for this problem. It was already known that the majority of hematopoietic stem cells normally remain in a resting phase and that their functionality is influenced by a controlled transition into cell division. In contrast, it remained unknown whether the length of individual cell division phases regulates the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells. Nicole Mende, the doctorate student in Prof. Waskow's research group who decisively processed the project, used gene transfer technology to specifically shorten the transit time through the early G1 phase of the cell cycle of human hematopoietic stem cells. As a result of the shortened G1 cell cycle phase transition, blood stem cells were better maintained after stress induction in vitro. However, most importantly, after transplantation into a very suitable mouse model that was previously generated by the same laboratory, the team from Dresden could show that the function of the treated stem cells was also significantly increased in the living organism. Interestingly, a similar manipulation of the cell cycle, which however affects a later point in time in the G1 phase, shows precisely opposite effects and a fast loss of the stem cell function. These results show that a balanced transit velocity through the early and late G1 phase is an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell function and it therefore makes an essential contribution to the lifelong maintenance of blood formation. Further, alterations of G1 transition kinetics may be the basis for functional defects of hematopoietic stem cells from aged mice or elderly humans.","Published: July 15, 2015"

And, like so many important discoveries in science, this one started out with a neglected flask sitting in a storage fridge, in this case in the lab of Andrei Sanov, a professor in the UA's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Sanov and two of his students report the first definitive observation and spectroscopic characterization of ethylenedione, or ""OCCO,"" representing two carbon monoxide molecules chemically bound together. According to the researchers, the interest in this deceptively ""simple"" compound is fueled by many reasons: from its assumed role as a fleeting intermediate in a flurry of chemical reactions to its alleged properties as a wonder drug. Forgoing the past synthetic strategies that relied on the manipulation of neutral species, two students in Sanov s laboratory created OCCO from its negatively charged ion and used a highly advanced technique called photoelectron imaging spectroscopy to analyze the product. This technique uses laser pulses to eject electrons from molecules, effectively yielding ""a portrait of the molecule viewed from within,"" as Sanov put it. The results confirm the existence of the elusive species and reveal its important fundamental properties, with implications not only for the basic understanding of so-called radical molecular species, but also industrial processes and potentially even atmospheric chemistry and climate modeling. Molecule Has Vexed Generations Chemists have pursued the OCCO molecule off and on since 1913, when its existence was first suggested. In the 1940s, at a particularly controversial turn in OCCO's history, it was claimed to be the active component of Glyoxylide, a purported antidote for a long list of afflictions, from exhaustion to cancer. The claims were classified as fraud by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, because the wonder drug proved to be nothing but water. Nonetheless, to this day the myth of Glyoxylide as a ""lost"" cancer remedy continues to be perpetuated on the Internet. According to Sanov, one of the motivations for pursuing ethylenedione is the elegant fundamental puzzle that the molecule presents: Most students with elementary chemistry education can draw the straightforward structure, O=C=C=O. Over the years, the anticipated existence of OCCO also has been backed by predictions of sophisticated theory. However, all past studies failed to provide conclusive experimental evidence that ethylenedione exists   and therein lay the puzzle. ""We are not talking about some complex compound here,"" Sanov said. ""This is a small molecule with only four atoms and an 'obvious' structure. Shouldn't modern science be able to tackle it?"" The key to the mystery is the unstable nature of the OCCO, which tends to split into two carbon monoxide (CO) fragments after half a nanosecond or so. OCCO is what chemists call a diradical. Radicals and diradicals play exceptionally important roles in controlling the mechanisms and outcomes of chemical reactions, involved in all aspects of life, industry, technology and environment. ""Radicals and diradicals are all around us,"" Sanov said. ""Think of them as molecules with unpaired electrons that are 'underemployed' and looking for action. This means that they are eager to react, because the making and breaking of chemical bonds is controlled by electrons. A radical is a molecule that has one such 'underemployed' electron. A diradical has two."" From a spectroscopist s point of view, OCCO's properties leave the molecule with no reason to evade detection, he explained. ""And yet, it had never been observed, neither as a substance nor as a transient species, despite a century-long history of attempts,"" Sanov said. A Nearly Forgotten Flask  Until now. More precisely, until the day when Andrew Dixon, a soon-to-be fifth-year doctoral student in Sanov's lab and the lead author of the paper, opened the fridge and spotted a flask labeled ""Glyoxal."" ""We started with a general interest in diradical systems and as part of those experiments, we decided to purchase some glyoxal, a precursor that is widely used in industrial applications but has not been explored as a potential synthesis molecule because its high water content makes it very difficult to work with,"" Dixon said.""Once we had bought it, we looked at it and I remember thinking, 'Oh man, this has 60 percent water. Let's figure this out some other day.'"" During a conversation with a colleague, Dixon became aware of a compound that functions as a ""molecular sieve,"" stripping the glyoxal solution of its high water content. ""Once we had it in the gas phase so we could analyze it in our mass spectrometer, it turned out to be a good sample to work with, giving nice signal intensity,"" Dixon said. ""We tried to find a name for the molecule that we were making, and a Wikipedia search pulled up ethylenedione. That's when we noticed it was something new.""  ""We tried to rule out every other possible solution,"" said co-author Tian Xue, who will be a senior undergraduate student in the fall, ""to make sure it wasn't some other anion that could pose as OCCO."" To snap a ""portrait"" of the elusive species, they then unleashed lasers of short duration and precisely defined energies onto the molecules they produced. ""We can create a beam of ions, and as they travel into the mass spectrometer, different molecules travel at different speeds, which allow us to separate out our ion of interest,"" Dixon explained. ""In our window of interest, we can pulse the laser right when the expected OCCO anion is passing through."" Using the laser pulses, Dixon and Xue were able to shoot off excess electrons from the stable anion of ethylenedione. They then captured photoelectron images of the quantum states of the resulting neutral OCCO at the very beginning of the molecule s lifespan, which lasts only about half a nanosecond. ""This seems very short by human standards, but is in fact a long lifetime in the molecular realm,"" Sanov said.","Published: July 15, 2015"

Although more than 180 HPV genomes have been sequenced, there has been little research on the diversity of HPV genomes within the same patient, primarily because the virus is thought to have a low mutation rate. Of the 13 HPV genotypes thought to be carcinogenic, HPV16 is responsible for about half of all invasive cervical cancer cases worldwide. In the study, the researchers sequenced HPV16 genomes from 10 patients with cervical cancer and one with non-malignant genital warts. To date, most genomic studies of papillomaviruses have used Sanger sequencing to look at the ""most prevalent, consensus sequence"" during chronic infection, but Sanger sequencing may ""not be appropriate to capture the dynamics of slowly evolving viruses, such as PVs,"" the authors wrote. So, they decided to turn to next-generation sequencing. The authors extracted DNA from 10 clinical samples of invasive cervical cancer and one case of genital warts caused by HPV16. They used long PCR to generate 8-kb long amplicons   the size of the HPV genome   and sequenced them using Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent PGM. The authors generated both a consensus genome and also de novoassembled each sample using CLC software. Comparing the clinical samples to the reference sequence, the researchers observed 190 changes, with the E2 gene containing the largest number of changes. Two samples had duplication events in the L1 gene and L2 gene, respectively. The team also performed a phylogenetic analysis using consensus sequences from the PGM data as well as 20 HPV16 genomes from GenBank. From the eleven clinical samples, the researchers identified three types of HPV: HPV16_A1, HPV16_A2, and HPV16_D. In addition, these types correlated with specific tumor types, with squamous cell carcinomas associated with the A type and adenocarcinomas associated with the D types. To analyze intra-host variation, the researchers performed de novo assembly. They were able to generate one contiguous sequence for four samples, with the remaining seven samples in three to eight contigs. The researchers identified between three and 125 polymorphic sites per genome. In the most diverse sample, 31 of the 125 polymorphic sites represented more than 10 percent of the reads in that position. In the least diverse sample, only one polymorphic site represented more than 5 percent of the reads at that position. Next, the team calculated a ""diversity index"" for each sample, defined as the ""probability of a randomly chosen genome to be identical to the consensus genome."" The median value for the samples was just 40 percent. The authors suggest a number of factors could contribute to the diversity observed, including both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance, the APOBEC3G family of proteins have been shown to target papillomavirus DNA, "" which may partially account for the broad diversity of human PVs."" In addition, ""polymorphisms observed in the E6 gene could be a result of an immune selective pressure,"" the authors wrote. In the future, more research will need to be done on HPV infection to monitor viral diversity in asymptomatic, productive, benign, premalignant and malignant infections. ""The possible role of oncovirus intralesion diversity generated during chronic infections should be explored as a differential factor for increased oncogenic potential,"" they wrote.","Published: July 15, 2015"

The FDA is providing a three-year compliance period to allow industry to gradually phase out their use in processed food. This step is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year in the US. The European Society of Cardiology welcomes the FDA decision ""to remove artificial trans fat from the food supply"" and calls upon European policy makers to urgently bring forward EU-wide regulation to address this important health issue. Partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of artificial transfats in the food supply. They are the most often used source of fat in commercial bakery products. TFAs raise the level of LDL (""bad"") cholesterol in the blood. An elevated LDL cholesterol level in the blood increases the risk of developing heart disease. The detrimental effects of TFAs on heart health and mortality are now beyond dispute. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death in Europe. Each year CVD causes over 4 million deaths in Europe and over 1.9 million deaths in the EU. CVD causes 47% of all deaths in Europe and 40% of deaths in the EU. There are very significant differences in mortality rates between countries. The current TFA intake in Eastern and South Eastern Europe is often high, increasing the European CVD burden and widening national and international inequalities.   Based on the effects on cardiovascular health of TFA intake, the positive experiences from different interventions to limit TFA intake and the accumulated knowledge on differential consumption of TFA across Europe, the European Society of Cardiology believes that a regulatory intervention is necessary to ensure that all EU citizens can effectively reduce their TFA intake.","Published: July 15, 2015"

Group A streptococcus causes around 600 million infections per year worldwide. Severe infections can cause necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, sepsis, or toxic shock, and around one in four people who suffer an invasive infection do not survive. Researchers at Imperial College London and clinicians at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, together with colleagues at Public Health England, noticed a sharp rise in infections caused by one particular strain, called emm89, from 1998 to 2009. To investigate why, they sequenced the genomes of bacterial samples from patients. The genetic sequences revealed a new subtype of emm89 streptococcus whose emergence coincided with the surge in cases. Japan, Canada, France and Sweden have reported a surge in the same strain type, raising the possibility that the new variant is spreading globally. The study, published in the journal mBio, was funded by the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre and the UK Clinical Research Collaboration. Group A streptococcus can infect the skin or the throat, where it can cause tonsillitis. Less commonly, it infects deeper parts of the body, where it is much more dangerous. There are around 1300 to 1800 of these invasive infections each year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and health experts are increasingly concerned about periodic upsurges in both non-invasive and invasive diseases caused by group A strep. The new variant has evolved two important differences from other members of the strain: it produces more toxin, and has completely lost its outer capsule.  The fact that it had lost its capsule was a complete surprise, because it was believed that the capsule was essential for group A streptococcus to cause invasive disease,  said Dr Claire Turner, a Junior Research Fellow at Imperial College London who led the study. The researchers are still uncertain about why the new variant without capsule has become so dominant.  We know that without capsule, they stick better to surfaces, so that may help them to transmit more easily. Another possibility is that they can more easily get inside human cells, which makes them harder to treat,  said Dr Turner. Professor Shiranee Sriskandan from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, the senior author of the study, said:  We know very little about how group A streptococcus is transmitted from person to person. We need to look into this more deeply and think about better ways to prevent transmission.  This discovery was made possible thanks to the cooperation of our hospital diagnostic lab and the national reference lab, which helped us to spot a pattern locally and then study it nationally.  Luckily, the new variant remains exquisitely sensitive to penicillin and related antibiotics. But we also need to think about whether our treatment strategies are as good as they can be.

Brain structures involved in reward, learning and executive control showed vast changes even after a prolonged period of abstinence from drug use. ""We found that after an average of 13.5 months of abstinence, women who were previously dependent on stimulants had significantly less gray matter volume in several brain areas compared to healthy women,"" said the study's senior author, Jody Tanabe, M.D., professor of radiology, vice chair of Research, and Neuroradiology Section Chief at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine. ""These brain areas are important for decision making, emotion, reward processing and habit formation."" For the study, Dr. Tanabe and colleagues sought to determine how the brains of people previously dependent on stimulants differed from the brains of healthy people. ""We specifically wanted to determine how these brain effects differed by gender,"" Dr. Tanabe said. The researchers analyzed structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams in 127 men and women, including 59 people (28 women and 31 men) who were previously dependent on cocaine, amphetamines, and/or methamphetamine for an average of 15.7 years, and 68 healthy people (28 women and 40 men) who were similar in age and gender. The MRI results showed that after an average of 13.5 months of abstinence, women who were previously dependent on stimulants had significantly less gray matter volume in frontal, limbic and temporal regions of the brain. ""While the women previously dependent on stimulants demonstrated widespread brain differences when compared to their healthy control counterparts, the men demonstrated no significant brain differences,"" Dr. Tanabe said. The researchers also looked at how these brain volume differences were related to behaviors. They found that lower regional gray matter volumes correlated with behavioral tendencies to seek reward and novelty. ""Lower gray matter volumes in women who had been stimulant dependent were associated with more impulsivity, greater behavioral approach to reward, and also more severe drug use,"" Dr. Tanabe said. ""In contrast, all men and healthy women did not show such correlations."" According to Dr. Tanabe, the results may provide a clue to the biological processes underlying the clinical course of stimulant abuse in men and women.

Scientists tracked cocaine cravings in more than 70 adult male mice and found that those rodents whose daily drill included exploration, learning and finding hidden tasty morsels were less likely than their enrichment-deprived counterparts to seek solace in a chamber where they had been given cocaine. ""We have compelling behavioral evidence that self-directed exploration and learning altered their reward systems so that when cocaine was experienced it made less of an impact on their brain,"" said Linda Wilbrecht, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at UC Berkeley and senior author of the paper just published in the journal, Neuropharmacology. By contrast, mice who were not intellectually challenged and/or whose activities and diets were restricted, were eager to return to the quarters where they had been injected with cocaine for weeks on end. ""We know that mice living in deprived conditions show higher levels of drug-seeking behavior than those living in stimulating environments, and we sought to develop a brief intervention that would promote resilience in the deprived animals,"" said study lead author Josiah Boivin, a Ph.D. student in neuroscience at UC San Francisco who conducted the research at UC Berkeley as part of his thesis work. Drug abuse and addiction rank among the world's more costly, destructive and seemingly insurmountable problems. Previous studies have found that poverty, trauma, mental illness and other environmental and physiological stressors can alter the brain's reward circuitry and make us more susceptible to substance abuse. The good news about this latest study is that it offers scalable interventions against drug-seeking behaviors, albeit through evidence based on animal behavior. ""Our data are exciting because they suggest that positive learning experiences, through education or play in a structured environment, could sculpt and develop brain circuits to build resilience in at-risk individuals, and that even brief cognitive interventions may be somewhat protective and last a relatively long time,"" Wilbrecht said. Researchers compared the lure of drugs, specifically cocaine, in three sets of mice: The test or ""trained"" mice were put through a nine-day cognitive training program based on exploration, incentives and rewards while their ""yoked-to-trained"" counterparts received rewards but no challenges. The ""standard-housed"" mice stayed in their home cages with restricted diets and activities. For a few hours each day, the trained mice and yoked-to-trained mice were set loose in adjacent chambers. The trained mice were free to explore and engage in enrichment activities, which included digging up Honey Nut Cheerios in a pot of scented wood shavings. The exercise kept them on their toes because the rules for how to find the treats would change on a regular basis. Meanwhile, their yoked-to-trained counterparts received a Honey Nut Cheerio each time their trained partner hit the jackpot, but did not have to work for it. As for the standard-housed mice, they remained in their cages without enrichment opportunities or Honey Nut Cheerios. After the cognitive training phase of the experiment, all three sets of mice remained in their cages for a month. Next, the mice were set loose, one by one, to explore two adjoining chambers in a plexiglass box, which differed from one another in smell, texture and pattern. The researchers recorded which chamber each mouse preferred and then set about changing their preference by giving them cocaine in the chamber that they had repeatedly not favored. For the drug seeking test, the mice received mock injections, and were freed to explore both chambers for 20 minutes, using the open doorway to scamper back and forth. At first, all the mice overwhelmingly returned to the chamber where they had presumably enjoyed the cocaine. But in subsequent weekly drug seeking tests, the mice who had received cognitive training showed less preference for the chamber where they had been high on cocaine. And that pattern continued. ""Overall, the data suggest that deprivation may confer vulnerability to drug seeking behavior and that brief interventions may promote long-term resilience,"" Wilbrecht said.

In a University of California, San Diego School of Medicine study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, a research team led by Takaki Komiyama, PhD, assistant professor of neurosciences and neurobiology, reports that in mouse models, the brain significantly changed its visual cortex operation modes by implementing top-down processes during learning.  We found that when the mouse assigns a new meaning to a previously neutral visual stimulus, top-down control becomes much more influential in activating the visual cortex,  said first author Hiroshi Makino, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in Komiyama s lab.  Top-down inputs interact with specific neuron types in the visual cortex to modulate its operation modes.  This cognitive process uses our thoughts and influences our senses. For example, when we see a word with missing letters, our brain is able to fill in the blank based on past experiences. Researchers looked at activity in excitatory neurons and somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex and top-down inputs from the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) during associative learning to see how these affected the top-down and bottom-up processing when perception begins with the senses. The findings indicate that intricate interactions of various circuit components effectively change the balance of top-down and bottom-up processing, with learning enhancing the contribution of top-down control. These results support the long-standing theory that the brain does not faithfully represent the environment but rather attempts to predict it based upon prior information.  In addition to revealing circuit mechanisms underlying these learning-related changes, our findings may have implications in understanding the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, that generate abnormal perception,  said Makino.

In a new study, researchers from Uppsala University, Sweden, now show that sleep does not only help form long-term memory but also ensures access to it during times of cognitive stress. It is well known that during sleep newly learned information is transferred from short-term to long-term memory stores in humans. In the study that is being published in the scientific journal SLEEP, sleep researchers Jonathan Cedernaes and Christian Benedict, sought to investigate the role of nocturnal sleep duration for this memory transfer, and how long-term memories formed by sleep remain accessible after acute cognitive stress. Following a learning session in the evening during which 15 participants learned 15 card pair locations on a computer screen, in one experimental session subjects slept for half a night (4-hr) and in the other for a full night (8-hr). The next morning subjects were asked to recall as many card pair locations as possible. What the researchers found was that half a night of sleep (4-hr) was as powerful as a full night of sleep (8-hr) to form long-term memories for the learned card pair locations. However, the study also revealed that stress had an impact on the participants' ability to recall these memories. The men were acutely stressed for 30 minutes in the morning after a half or full night of sleep (for example by having to recall a newly learnt list of words while exposed to noise). Following short sleep this stress exposure reduced their ability to recall these card pair locations by around 10 percent. In contrast, no such stress-induced impairment was seen when the same men were allowed to sleep for a full night. ""On the basis of our study findings, we have two important take home messages: First, even though losing half a night of sleep may not impair memory functions under baseline conditions, the addition of acute cognitive stress may be enough to lead to significant impairments, which can possibly be detrimental in real-world scenarios. Second, interventions such as delaying school start times and greater use of flexible work schedules, that increase available snooze time for those who are on habitual short sleep, may improve their academic and occupational performance by ensuring optimal access to memories under stressful conditions,"" says Jonathan Cedernaes, researcher at the Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University. ""An important next step will be to investigate how chronic sleep loss and or more chronic stress may interact to impair the ability to retrieve memories that are consolidated during sleep,"" says Jonathan Cedernaes.

This enabled them to produce the most detailed pictures yet obtained of a vesicle coat assembled on the vesicle membrane. This imaging technique is still in its infancy and although scientists have been able to gather structural information about parts of the membrane coats in other types of vesicle, this is the first time a model of a complete assembled vesicle coat has been produced. What the images revealed was surprising: unlike other types of vesicle, where the coat is thought to be made from proteins assembled in different layers - each with a specific function - around the vesicle membrane, the EMBL team observed that the proteins in the COPI coat all intertwine together in one big layer, which is curved to fit around the membrane. More precisely, the COPI coat is made of a repetition of building blocks, called ""triads"", that contain all the important functional elements organised in a precise 3D structure.

The researchers have developed an instrument they equate to an  optical dog s nose  which uses a special laser to measure the molecular content of a sample of gas.  Rather than sniffing out a variety of smells as a dog would, the laser system uses light to  sense  the range of molecules that are present in the sample,  says Dr James Anstie, Australian Research Council (ARC) Research Fellow with the University s Institute for Photonics and Advanced Sensing (IPAS).  Those molecules are by-products of metabolic processes in the body and their levels change when things go wrong. There have been good studies undertaken around the world which show that diseases like lung and oesophageal cancer, asthma and diabetes can be detected in this way, even before external symptoms are showing.  Breath analysis is a relatively new field being pursued around the world. But the system being developed offers almost-instant results, high sensitivity and the ability to test for a range of molecules at once   making it promising for broadscale health screening. The system uses a specialised laser   an optical frequency comb   that sends up to a million different light frequencies through the sample in parallel. Each molecule absorbs light at different optical frequencies and therefore has a unique molecular fingerprint.   We now have a robust system to be able to detect the presence and concentrations of molecules in a sample,  says Dr Anstie.  The next step is to work out how to accurately sample and interpret the levels which will naturally vary from person to person.  Dr Anstie believes the group will have a working prototype in 2-3 years and a commercial  plug and play  product could be available in 3-5 years.

Stem cells are immature cells that can differentiate into more specialized cells in the body. In early clinical trials, researchers are testing whether stem cells can be differentiated into cells to replace those that are defective and die off in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and Stargardt s disease. Such degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss, affecting more than 10 million people in the U.S. more than cataracts and glaucoma combined. While such clinical trials have shown early promise, there are many scientific questions to be answered.  One important question is whether it makes a difference where the stem cells come from,  Dyer said.  Our research sought to explore that question and also to learn more about the biology of these stem cells.  The researchers compared two types of stem cells called  induced pluripotent stem cells,  which can be generated from adult cells. The stem cells they compared were fibroblast-derived cells generated from skin, and those generated from mature eye cells called rod photoreceptor cells. Scientists previously thought that induced pluripotent stem cells could not be made from adult neurons without introducing a mutation that switches off a key regulatory gene called p53. Dyer s lab developed a new method for making stem cells from neurons that did not require p53 inactivation. This 3-D culture technique involved surrounding the neurons undergoing reprogramming with normal retinal neurons, to create a more natural environment for producing stem cells from neurons. This technique contrasts with the more common culture technique of growing the cells in layers on culture dishes, which is not successful for such cells. Once the stem cells are produced, they can then be used to make retinal cells in 3-D cultures. Besides the 3-D culture technique, the researchers also used a set of measurements, called STEM-RET, which enabled them to quantify precisely how successful different retinal cells are in generating retinal cells. Their STEM-RET analysis revealed that the rod-derived stem cells produced more retinal cells than did the fibroblast stem cells. The fibroblast-derived retinal cells were missing some cell types needed for fully functional retinas. Dyer and his colleagues also explored the biological differences in the two stem cell types that could explain their differences in producing retinal cells. Specifically, the researchers analyzed differences in the epigenetic control machinery of the two types. Such epigenetic machinery of cells consists of biological switches that control the cell s genes. These are distinct from the genetic control machinery built into the DNA structure of the cell s genes themselves. Scientists believe that different stem cell types may retain an  epigenetic memory a distinctive set of epigenetic switches, even as they are reprogrammed from mature cell types. This  memory  affects how well the stem cells produce different cell types. In their analysis of the retinal cells, the researchers detected a type of epigenetic switch, called CTCF, which contributes to the epigenetic memory of the rod-derived stem cells. This epigenetic switch, they believe, could play a role in making the rod stem cells a superior source of retinal cells. Dyer said that STEM-RET scoring of stem cells represents a significant advance in determining which stem cells to use in retinal stem cell therapies.  There has long been a debate in the field about how to standardize the quantification of stem cell differentiation,  he said.  Our STEM-RET method enables that standardization, which means that laboratories can accurately compare their results with one another and different stem cell lines can be compared with one another. We believe the method could be adopted widely.  Epigenetic analysis of such stem cells could lead to  epigenetic fingerprints  characterizing different stem cell types.  Such fingerprints would tell researchers which stem cell lines would most likely be effective in making retinal cells, bone marrow cells or other types of mature cells for therapeutic purposes,  Dyer said. The 3-D culture technique and STEM-RET measurement protocol allow scientists to manipulate stem cells genetically and with drugs to discover ways to better reprogram the cells into functional mature cells for therapeutic use.","Published: July 14, 2015"

The new understanding could help both approaches, says UW-Madison professor of biochemistry Ronald Raines, who has long studied ribonucleases - enzymes that break apart RNA, a messenger with multiple roles inside the cell. In 1998, he discovered how to alter one ribonuclease to avoid its deactivation in the body. Soon thereafter, he found that the engineered ribonuclease was more toxic to cancer cells than to others.  Raines patented the advance through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and with UW-Madison chemist Laura Kiessling cofounded Quintessence Biosciences in Madison. They remain shareholders in the firm, which has licensed the patent from WARF and begun early-phase human trials with the ribonuclease at the UW Carbone Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.   The current study began as an effort to figure out why the ribonuclease was selective for cancer cells. To identify which structure on the cell surface helped it enter the cell, Raines screened 264 structures using a specially designed chip. The winner was a carbohydrate called Globo H.  ""We were surprised - delighted - to see that because we already knew that Globo H is an antigen that is abundant in many tumors,"" Raines says. Antigens are complex molecules with structures that are recognizable to proteins called antibodies.  ""Globo H is under development as the basis for a vaccine that will teach the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells,"" he says.  Working with Samuel Danishefsky, who solved the difficult problem of synthesizing Globo H at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Raines found that reducing the Globo H display on the surface made breast cancer cells less vulnerable to ribonucleases like those that Quintessence is testing. ""This was exciting, as we now have a much clearer idea of how our drug candidate is working."" Biochemistry Professor John Markley aided the research with studies of the structure of the molecules in question.  The picture that emerges from the work is of ribonucleases patrolling our bodies, looking for telltales of cancer cells, Raines says. ""We are working to demonstrate this surveillance more clearly in mice, but don't have direct evidence yet."" As other scientists test whether using a vaccine will start an immune attack on Globo H, Raines says, ""we are probing a different type of immunity. This innate immunity does not involve the immune system. It's a way for our bodies to fight cancer without using white blood cells or antibodies, just an enzyme and a carbohydrate.""","Published: July 14, 2015"

They believe their study ( The mesh is a network of microtubule connectors that stabilizes individual kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle ), which has been published in Life, changes our understanding of the cell's internal scaffolding. The work has implications for researchers' understanding of cancer cells as the mesh is partly made of a protein which is found to change in certain cancers, such as those of the breast and bladder, according to Stephen Royle, Ph.D., team leader and associate professor and senior Cancer Research UK Fellow at the division of biomedical cell biology at Warwick Medical School.A 3D view of the mesh: microtubules (green tubes) of the mitotic spindle are held together by a yellow network, the mesh. Credit: Warwick Medical School. ""As a cell biologist you dream of finding a new structure in cells but it's so unlikely. Scientists have been looking at cells since the 17th Century and so to find something that no-one has seen before is amazing,"" he said. Researchers made the discovery by accident while looking at gaps between microtubules which are part of the cells' internal skeleton. In dividing cells, these gaps are incredibly small at just 25 nanometers (3,000 times thinner than a human hair). One of Dr. Royle's Ph.D. students was examining mitotic spindles in dividing cells via tomography. While inter-microtubule bridges in the mitotic spindle had been seen before, the researchers were the first to view the mesh. ""We had been looking in 2D and this gave the impression that 'bridges' linked microtubules together,  continued Dr. Royle.  This had been known since the 1970s. All of a sudden, tilting the fiber in 3D showed us that the bridges were not single struts at all but a web-like structure linking all the microtubules together."" The discovery impacts on the research into cancerous cells. A cell needs to share chromosomes accurately when it divides otherwise the two new cells can end up with the wrong number of chromosomes (aneuploidy) which has been linked to a range of tumors in different body organs. The mitotic spindle is responsible for sharing the chromosomes and the researchers at the university believe that the mesh is needed to give structural support. Too little support from the mesh and the spindle will be too weak to work properly; however too much support will result in it being unable to correct mistakes. It was found that one of the proteins that make up the mesh, TACC3, is over-produced in certain cancers. When this situation was mimicked in the lab, the mesh and microtubules were altered and cells had trouble sharing chromosomes during division. According to Emma Smith, Ph.D., from Cancer Research UK,  This early research provides the first glimpse of a structure that helps share out a cell's chromosomes correctly when it divides, and it might be a crucial insight into why this process becomes faulty in cancer and whether drugs could be developed to stop it from happening.""","Published: July 14, 2015"

Infertility may arise from paternal or maternal factors, or both. When this uncertainty persists, couples may be unable to start the most appropriate fertility treatments. And the birth of a healthy child may be delayed. To date, evaluation of male infertility has lagged evaluation of female infertility, even though the American Society for Reproductive Medicine holds that infertility is due in equal measure to male and female factors. Male factors that have been subject to scrutiny have been limited to a few semen parameters, in addition to a review of the prospective father s reproductive and family histories. Existing semen parameters sperm concentration, motility, and morphology are useful mainly for the diagnosis of obvious cases of male infertility. The new test, however, can provide an objective measure of the paternal contribution to infertility. It was developed in the laboratory of Stephen Krawetz, Ph.D., a researcher at Wayne State University, in collaboration with scientists from CReATe Fertility Center, University of Toronto, Harvard University, and Georgia Regents University.  We assessed spermatozoal RNAs from 96 couples presenting with idiopathic infertility and identified the final reproductive outcome and sperm RNA elements (SREs) reflective of fecundity status,  the authors wrote.  The absence of required SREs reduced the probability of achieving live birth by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination from 73 to 27%.  The authors added, however, that the absence of these same SREs does not appear to be critical when using assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection.  Upon validation, [next-generation sequencing of sperm RNA] may help to identify those couples who may benefit from assisted reproductive technologies and those couples who may be successful with minimal intervention,  said Dr. Krawetz.  It is our goal to use this technology to reduce both the time to live birth of a healthy child and the cost when couples seek infertility treatment, so as to reduce the stress on the couple.  About 13% of couples of reproductive age experience fertility problems. When fertility problems are identified, the usual response is to conduct extensive evaluation of the female partner before embarking on fertility treatment. But now, with the new test, the male partner may receive additional attention, beyond the evaluation of the usual semen parameters. In the current study, about 30% of the idiopathic infertile couples presented an incomplete set of required SREs, suggesting a male component as the cause of their infertility. Conversely, analysis of couples that failed to achieve a live birth despite presenting with a complete set of SREs suggested that a female factor may have been involved. This was confirmed by their diagnosis, noted the authors of the Science Translational Medicine article. According to Dr. Krawetz, the diagnostic potential of next-generation sequencing of sperm RNA indicates this method is ""better suited to the task"" of analyzing the male's role in infertility, and is a step toward personalized precision reproductive medicine that may help guide the couple to their successful treatment. Sperm RNA analysis at present is technically challenging, but it is being automated. The technique could become part of a routine examination as ""we move toward personalized and precision medicine,"" Dr. Krawetz asserted. While the test is experimental, it has the potential for cost savings for both the patients and the healthcare system. The next step, emphasized a Wayne State University press announcement, is to expand to a prospective blinded study and to begin to define a set of markers that may be predictive of assisted reproduction outcomes.","Published: July 14, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/early-lead-exposure-has-long-lasting-effect-193086,Early Lead Exposure Has Long Lasting Effect A team of researchers have found links between lead exposure in children and epigenetic alterations in regulatory regions of genes that are imprinted and known to be critical in growth regulation and brain development   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. These alterations seem to persist into adulthood, with more profound effects in males. Their study sheds more light on the long-term effects of early lead exposure on DNA and may help to develop therapies to treat or reverse the damage. Along with colleagues Kim Dietrich of the University of Cincinnati, Yue Li of Duke University, and NC State s David Skaar, the team looked at data collected from 105 participants in the Cincinnati lead study, which measured lead in children from birth to age 6 and a half. They followed up with the now-adult participants and took blood samples, which were sequenced for DNA methylation   data spanning 36 years.  We now have the first human evidence for an association between early lead exposure and three aberrantly methylated regulatory regions of imprinted genes,  says Hoyo.  But from a public health perspective, the results are very exciting because we can begin to think about identifying potential biological markers for early exposure to lead and other toxins in the environment.  The team spent several years pinpointing regulatory regions within DNA that may link early lead exposure to specific diseases, characterizing 22 of these regions to date. With this study, researchers looked at the 22 regions to see if lead exposure affected DNA methylation, the process that controls how a gene is expressed, essentially determining whether or not it is switched on or off. When methylation is altered, genes are either turned off (or silenced) or they are more active than they normally would be. The team found three imprinted genes whose expression was affected in adulthood by lead exposure from birth to 6 and a half years of age: PEG3, IGF2/H19 and PLAGL1/HYMAI. For PEG3 and IGF2/HI9, methylation decreased. The effects were sex-specific: decreased methylation for PEG3, which is associated with fetal development, affected males more than females, while the opposite was true forIGF2/H19. PLAGL1/HYMAI methylation, which increased, was not sex-specific. Additionally, they found that increased blood levels of lead later in postnatal development did not seem to have any other effects on the regulatory regions   the methylation changes occurred during the first 12 months, even as lead exposure continued to increase over the study period.  Genes are like computers with both hardware and software,  says Jirtle.  Most scientists have been studying the hardware, which is the genetic sequence, without looking at the software, which is the regulatory layer that alters how that gene is expressed. This study gives us a first look at how the software may be affected by early exposure to lead.  Hoyo and her team plan to continue investigating possible connections between lead exposure, gene expression and disease.  The dysregulated genes we identified in this study seem to be highly malleable, especially during prenatal development and early childhood. This raises the possibility that we could nudge them back toward normal if we could therapeutically target them at the right stage of development. ","Published: July 14, 2015"

Bile ducts act as the liver s waste disposal system, and malfunctioning bile ducts are behind a third of adult and 70 per cent of children s liver transplantations. The researchers used their  miniature bile ducts   to test new drugs for biliary disease, leading to the discovery that VX809   an experimental compound originally designed to treat the effects of cystic fibrosis in the lungs   could be the first treatment to prevent the damage cystic fibrosis causes to the liver and bile duct. Dr Fotios Sampaziotis, lead author and an MRC-Sparks clinical research fellow in hepatology, said:  Treating liver complications caused by bile duct disorders constitutes a major challenge   with the only treatment option often being liver transplantation. Identifying a new experimental drug that could prevent patients with cystic fibrosis from undergoing a liver transplantation, a major and life changing operation, could have huge implications for our patients. But, this treatment will need to be tested in clinical trials before it can be recommended to patients.  Until now there has been no way of generating large numbers of fully functional bile ducts that mimic disease in the lab, which has limited our understanding of biliary disorders and restricted the development of new drugs.  Using their  bile duct replicas  the researchers reproduced key features of two more bile duct diseases   polycystic liver disease and Alagille syndrome   and tested the effects of additional drugs, such as octreotide. Professor Ludovic Vallier, Principal Investigator and corresponding author from the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said:  The pharmaceutical applications of our system are particularly important as we don t have many human samples of this type of tissue to work on. This system could provide a unique resource for identifying new treatments.  Dr Nicholas Hannan, a senior author from the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, said:  The bile duct cells we have generated represent an invaluable tool to understand not only how healthy bile ducts develop and function, but also how diseased bile ducts behave and how they may respond to treatment. This opens up the possibility of modelling complex liver diseases and will certainly progress our understanding of biliary disease in the future.  To demonstrate that the cells they had grown were in fact forming bile ducts the researchers looked for characteristic markers and functions of the cells. They then compared these with samples from human donors and found that they were almost identical.  Dr Paul Colville-Nash, programme manager for stem cell, developmental biology and regenerative medicine at the MRC, said:  The approach developed in this work will enable a vast range of work, from understanding how organs grow and develop to a greater understanding of disease and testing new drugs. This work could also one day open the way to researchers building new bile ducts that will replace damaged segments of the liver. ","Published: July 14, 2015"

The method now typically used for detecting the presence of invasive species is word of mouth from anglers and other concerned members of the public, followed by many hours of netting, angling and electrofishing by state biologists, says Kinnison. Many times, reports go unverified until fish are abundant enough to be regularly caught. Current methods also are unlikely to detect the presence of invasive juveniles before they are large enough to be caught by anglers and biologists. Kinnison is leading a project to adapt emerging environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches to detect the presence of invasive species, and other aquatic species, in Maine waters. Environmental DNA detection targets species-specific DNA material shed by aquatic organisms when they die, defecate or shed skin cells. That DNA can last up to several weeks in surrounding waters and be detected in water samples. The pilot portion of this project, funded by the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund, includes use of water samples to describe the extent of invasive northern pike, Esox lucius, in the Penobscot River system. ""This technology has the potential to greatly enhance detection of many aquatic species by providing a much more sensitive and cost-effective approach than current field survey approaches,"" he says. According to the Maine Inland Fisheries & Wildlife Department, Northern Pike was illegally introduced into the Belgrade Chain of Lakes in the 1970s.  Today, they are present in at least 16 lakes in the Kennebec, Androscoggin, and coastal river drainages and are suspected in several other locations. Managers have traced the introduction of species such as pike from illegal transport or by out-migration from lakes where they have become established. Because pike are top predators, their introduction negatively impacts the state's prized salmon populations. Kinnison and ecology and environmental science graduate student Lauren Turinetti refined a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set, and fluorescent DNA binding probe, to detect a short but unique sequence of the northern pike DNA. The PCR amplification system turns a few original copies of pike DNA in a water sample into billions, and the fluorescent probe signals how many copies are made. Using this technique they have successfully detected pike DNA in water samples collected from Pushaw Lake in Penobscot County, Maine. The water samples they used were no bigger than a normal soda bottle (1 liter). They're now working to refine their field sampling and detection approaches to implement a wider-scale survey for pike in the Penobscot drainage. By collecting water samples throughout the drainage the investigators hope to obtain a snapshot of how far pike have spread in places where dam removals, passage projects and repairs have improved migration of anadromous species but also may have inadvertently opened the door to pike, says Kinnison. This relatively quick and inexpensive method could help Maine combat its invasive species crisis and help managers more efficiently apply their limited resources to a diversity of conservation challenges, saving valuable resources for management of invasions from the start rather than detecting them when they're already established. The most widely referenced paper (Pimental et al. 2005) on this issue reports that invasive species costs the United States more than $120 billion in damages every year, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.  Invasive species are also a leading cause contributing to the demise of many threatened or endangered species. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has adopted eDNA early detection as a core component of its invasive Asian carp monitoring program in the Great Lakes region. In 2010 alone, the federal government spent $78.5 million to prevent the introduction of carp to the Great Lakes, where they would threaten Great Lakes fisheries and endangered aquatic species. In the future, the researchers hope to fine tune the method so it will not only determine the presence of multiple species, but also abundance. ""Right now we are using quantitative PCR to detect single species, but with the developments that are occurring, we are probably not that far down the road from being able to detect and estimate the abundance of numerous species within the same water samples,"" says Kinnison.","Published: July 14, 2015"

In 8 of 10 reported cancer cases, Illumina scientists and physicians reviewed all the genome-wide sequencing data and identified nonspecific copy-number changes across multiple chromosomes, suggesting that these changes, when present in a woman whose fetal karyotype tests as normal, might represent a signal to the clinician to probe for the presence of cancer. The results of the study, entitled  Noninvasive Prenatal Testing and Incidental Detection of Occult Malignancies,  are available online in The Journal of the American Medical Association and the full article can be accessed at broadcast.jamanetwork.com. The paper will be included in the July 14 print edition of JAMA.  Abnormal tumor DNA, shed from maternal malignancies, can cause highly unusual NIPT results, including the findings of more than one chromosome abnormality detected,  commented Diana W. Bianchi, M.D., Executive Director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, and lead author of the publication.  All abnormal NIPT results should be confirmed with a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). If there is a difference between the fetal diagnostic test and the NIPT results, maternal cancer can be a rare but important underlying explanation. In order to provide the best maternal clinical care, this possibility should be considered, especially when multiple abnormalities of chromosome number are identified on the NIPT report.  In a retrospective analysis of 125,426 noninvasive verifi  Prenatal Tests, 3,757 (three percent) were positive for one or more aneuploidies involving chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X or Y. As part of Illumina s standard procedures, the laboratory contacts the referring physician to discuss all positive test results and to recommend a diagnostic procedure to obtain a confirmatory fetal karyotype. From this group of 3757 positive cases, 10 cases of maternal cancers were subsequently (between 3 and 39 weeks after NIPT) reported to the laboratory. At the time of NIPT these women were not diagnosed with cancer. In 3 cases the abnormal NIPT findings prompted a search for an underlying malignancy. Seven of these eight women had diagnostic tests that indicated a chromosomally-normal fetus, discordant with the NIPT test result. One woman did not undergo a diagnostic procedure. Maternal cancers were most frequently associated with the rare NIPT finding of multiple aneuploidies that were discordant with the fetal karyotype. The cancer types were clinically diverse, including three cases of B cell lymphoma and single cases of T-cell leukemia, Hodgkin s lymphoma, unspecified adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and neuroendocrine, colorectal and anal carcinomas. The cancers ranged from stage II to metastatic disease (IV). In one case, after completion of treatment, the abnormal DNA signature became undetectable in follow-up testing.  This study shows that NIPTs that use whole genome sequencing techniques may have the ability to detect some cancer signatures under certain conditions,  said Dr. Rick Klausner, Illumina s Chief Medical Officer.  The sensitivity and specificity of the verifi Prenatal Test to detect cancer is not currently known, and further studies will be required to develop a test for this specific purpose. We have published these results to help clinicians improve overall patient care by considering the possibility of maternal cancer if there is discordance between positive NIPT results and a normal fetal karyotype. We also want to encourage health care providers to contact the clinical sequencing laboratory with follow-up information on abnormal NIPT results that show concordance as well as discordance with fetal karyotype, including cancers diagnosed in pregnant women, so that we can better understand the nonspecific patterns of DNA changes that precede clinical symptoms.

Weill Cornell Medical College researchers have found that if PTEN, a known tumor-suppressor gene, has mutated or is absent, this delicate replication process derails and can lead to cancer development. The study, published July 9 in Nature Communications, could influence how future cancer patients are treated based on their genetic makeup.  Tumors without PTEN are more sensitive to chemotherapies that work by targeting DNA replication, while normal cells or cancers with active PTEN resist these treatments,  said Dr. Wen H. Shen, the study's lead investigator and an assistant professor of cell biology in radiation oncology at Weill Cornell.  Based on our research, knowing PTEN status is critical for guiding treatment choices.  In the late 1990s, scientists discovered the PTEN gene, and growing evidence has shown that PTEN is a powerful tumor suppressor. Less clear, however, has been whether and how PTEN works when it comes to DNA replication - and if loss of PTEN could impact this central process of genome transmission to allow development and progression of cancer. The Weill Cornell research team found that when the PTEN gene is missing or mutated, DNA is left unprotected in the duplication process and can become damaged or corrupted.  DNA replication is an error-prone process,  said Shen, who is also a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell.  As the DNA double helix unwinds and separates, forming a Y-shaped open structure, it is vulnerable to stress signals and damages.  Our study shows that PTEN acts as a guardian of this process by sitting right on the replication fork to recruit other essential protective partners,  she continued.  Without PTEN, this protection machinery falls apart. DNA is then unprotected, which leads to fork stalling and failure to restart.  Without PTEN or the protective proteins that PTEN recruits, Shen said, the DNA may become fragile and corrupted, leading the cell to produce stress signals. Cancer can result when the stress signals accumulate or when cells with unreplicated DNA rush into cell division prematurely to produce an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, a condition called aneuploidy. PTEN function is absent in a wide variety of cancers - for example, 70 percent of prostate cancers have PTEN mutation or deletion. Because of this, researchers are testing PTEN to see if it's a marker of aggressive cancer, and for personalized cancer treatment.  Patients whose cancers have lost PTEN or harbor mutations in the gene are known to have poorer outcomes than patients with active PTEN,  Shen said.  Our expectation is that a PTEN blood test in the near future will help clinicians decide on the right therapies for each cancer patient, and in particular, to benefit this subgroup of cancer patients carrying PTEN mutations.

But in a study on mice, a Duke University team has shown that injections of stem cells from bone marrow might be able to relieve this type of neuropathic pain. The researchers say their findings, which appear in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, may also advance cell-based therapies in chronic pain conditions, lower back pain and spinal cord injuries. The team used a type of stem cell known as bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which are known to produce an array of healing factors and can be coaxed into forming most other types of cells in the body. Stromal cells are already being tested in small-scale clinical studies of people with inflammatory bowel disease, heart damage and stroke. They have also shown promise for treating pain. However, it's not clear how they work. ""Based on these new results, we have the know-how and we can further engineer and improve the cells to maximize their beneficial effects,"" said Ru-Rong Ji, professor of anesthesiology and neurobiology in the Duke School of Medicine. In his team's study, the researchers used stromal cells to treat mice with pain caused by nerve damage. They delivered the cells by a lumbar puncture, infusing them into the fluid that bathes the spinal cord. Mice treated with the bone marrow stromal cells were much less sensitive to painful stimuli after their nerve injury compared with the untreated mice, the researchers found. ""This analgesic effect was amazing,"" Ji said. ""Normally, if you give an analgesic, you see pain relief for a few hours, at most a few days. But with bone marrow stem cells, after a single injection we saw pain relief over four to five weeks."" Pictures of the animals' spinal cords showed that the injected stem cells had set up shop alongside the nerve cells in the spinal cord. To understand how the stem cells alleviated pain, the researchers measured levels of anti-inflammatory molecules that had been previously linked to pain, finding that one in particular, TGF- 1, was present in higher amounts in the spinal fluid of the stem cell-treated animals compared with the untreated animals. TGF- 1 is a protein that is typically secreted by immune cells and is common throughout the body. Research has shown that people with chronic pain have too little TGF- 1, Ji said. In the new study, chemically neutralizing TGF- 1 reversed the pain-killing benefit of the BMSCs, suggesting that the secretion of this protein was a major reason why the cells helped with pain. Injecting TGF- 1 directly into spinal cord fluid provides relief too, but only for a few hours, Ji said. By contrast, bone marrow stromal cells stay on site for as much as three months after the infusion, the scientists found. This is the right length of time, Ji said, because if the stem cells stayed permanently there could be risk of them becoming cancerous. Importantly, BMSCs also migrate to the site of injury. That's because a molecule emitted from the injured nerve cells called CXCL12 -- which has also previously been linked to neuropathic pain -- acts as a homing signal of sorts, attracting the stem cells. The next step will be to find a way to make the stromal cells more efficient. ""If we know TGF- 1 is important, we can find a way to produce more of it,"" Ji said. In addition, the cells may produce other pain-relieving molecules; Ji's group is working to identify those. Duke University   press release Ji R-R et al.

The study titled  Mutations in SLC25A46, encoding a UGO1-like protein, cause an optic atrophy spectrum disorder  is published in the journal Nature Genetics. Patients with mutations in this gene present symptoms similar to optic atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2 (CMT2), including vision loss and weakening of the lower leg and foot muscles beginning in the first decade of life. The novel variants occur in a gene called SLC25A46 that functions in mitochondria, organelles inside animal cells known as the  cellular engines.  They transform food into fuel that allow cells to carry out energy-demanding functions.  Mitochondria play a large role in human health,  said Alexander Abrams, Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at the UM Miller School of Medicine and first author of the study.  Although we study rare diseases such as CMT2 and optic atrophy, the implications encompass all forms of neurodegeneration including Lou Gehrig s and Parkinson's Diseases.  Mitochondria constantly undergo fusion and fission to respond to cellular energy demands. By changing their size and connectivity through fusion and fission, mitochondria can travel to regions in cells where they are needed.  Our study reveals that disrupting SLC25A46 causes mitochondria to become both more highly interconnected and improperly localized in cells,  said Julia E. Dallman, assistant professor of Biology in the UM College of Arts and Sciences and a senior author of the study.  These data support a critical role for SLC25A46 and mitochondrial dynamics in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal processes.  SLC25A46 encodes an atypical protein in the SLC25 family. SLC25 family members act like a channel, transporting molecules across the bilayer membranes inside mitochondria. But unlike the majority of human SLC25 family members (there are 53) that transport molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane, SLC25A46 settles on the outer mitochondrial membrane where it regulates mitochondrial dynamics. Mutations in the genes associated with mitochondria dynamics OPA1 and MFN2 are linked to similar mitochondrial disorders. Homologous genes in baker s yeast, work in combination with a gene called UGO1, which has ancestral similarities to SLC25A46. The new findings suggest that the SLC25A46 and Ugo1 proteins may play similar roles. Given the similarities between the diseases caused by mutations in OPA1, MFN2 and SLC25A46, these genes could be involved in common pathological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, the study says.  This finding builds on our discovery of MFN2 as a major disease gene in this area over 10 years ago,  said Dr. Stephan Z chner, professor and chair of the Dr. John T. Macdonald Foundation Department of Human Genetics, at UM s Miller School of Medicine, and a senior author of the study.  Only through the new genome sequencing methods and active global data exchange were we able to solve this puzzle.  University of Miami   press release Dallman JE et al.

In a paper published July 1 in The Journal of Neuroscience, the Johns Hopkins team says its studies in mice have verified an increased number of connections between certain sensory cells and nerve cells in the inner ear of aging mice. Because these connections normally tamp down hearing when an animal is exposed to loud sound, the scientists think these new connections could also be contributing to age-related hearing loss in the mice, and possibly in humans. ""The nerve cells that connect to the sensory cells of the inner ear are known to inhibit hearing, and although it's not yet clear whether that's their function in older mice, it's quite likely,"" says Paul Fuchs, Ph.D., the John E. Bordley Professor of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""If confirmed, our findings give us new ideas for how physicians may someday treat or prevent age-related hearing loss."" Fuchs says the new research builds on the knowledge that inside the ear lies a coiled row of sensory cells responsible for converting sound waves into electrical signals sent through nerve cells to the brain, which processes and tells animals what they ""hear."" Two sets of these so-called hair cells -- named for the filaments that act like antennae picking up sound waves -- exist, an inner tier closest to the brain and an outer tier. The outer ones have a secondary function: to amplify the sound waves within the inner ear. Not surprisingly, Fuchs notes, a loss of outer hair cells closely correlates with a loss of hearing. But studies over the last decade have suggested that changes over time also occur in the connections between hair cells and the nerve cells to which they are attached. Each of those nerve cells is like a one-way street, Fuchs says, taking signals either from the ear to the brain or vice versa. The nerve cells that take signals to the ear are known to turn down the amplification provided by outer hair cells when an animal is, for example, exposed to a noisy environment for an extended period of time. Previous research has suggested that with age, inner hair cells in mice and humans experience a decrease in outgoing nerve cell connections, while incoming nerve cell connections increase. To find out if the new connections worked -- or worked normally -- Stephen Zachary, a graduate student in Fuchs' laboratory, painstakingly recorded electrical signals from within the inner hair cells of young and old mice. He found that the incoming nerve cells were indeed active and that their activity levels correlated with the animals' hearing abilities: The harder of hearing an animal was, the higher the activity of its incoming nerve cells. ""These nerve cell connections seem to be reverting back to the way they worked during early development before the animals' sense of hearing was operating,"" says Fuchs. ""We don't know why the new connections form, but it might be as simple as a lack of competition for space once the outgoing nerve cells have retracted."" If the same phenomenon is occurring in human ears, Fuchs and his team say there may be ways of preventing the incoming nerve cells from forming new connections with inner hair cells, a technique that could help maintain normal hearing through old age.

Firstly, the people working in the lab, secondly the processes they follow and thirdly what equipment they have and how they use it.  As the study of living systems and of the materials derived from these systems Life Science is arguably the most variable of all the scientific disciplines. Working with living organisms means that even the slightest change in process or environment can lead to a radical change in the outcome of any test.  Is your incubator running a little warm? Expect to see a change in culture growth on your agar plates. Have you changed microcentrifuge tube to a cheaper, less well-contained alternative? You might find that your proteins aren t quite as intact as they used to be.  Not only is the substrate variable, but things acting upon this substrate, like enzymes, are also innately variable. This variability means that planning and ensuring continued tight control over processes, training and equipment is vital for efficient and consistent running of Life Sciences laboratories. From setting out your bench correctly to choosing the right type of storage boxes, this article sets out 10 simple tips to make your lab more efficient today:People 1. Hire the right people Nothing is more important to an efficient life science laboratory (or any laboratory for that matter) than its people. Whether in the academic, commercial or public sector, lab teams require strong leadership, continuous education and training and motivation with clear, achievable objectives. 2. Foster a culture of innovation Actively ask, and encourage others to ask  why am I doing it this way?  If there is a better way, apply proper scientific method to validate the new protocol.  Rather than everyone having free-reign, regular method review should be a planned exercise so as to avoid distractions from the task at hand.  Processes 3. Lean your bench space Being lean doesn t have to involve anything complex; as a starting point place the items you use most next to your dominant hand and have a few  dry runs  of any new methods to ensure that your bench space is laid out in a logical way.  Consider including a bench layout plan in the method to ensure that your labmates can be as efficient as possible too. 4. Share the responsibilities Making certain people accountable for particular areas of the lab in terms of cleanliness and organisation will ensure that the whole environment, not just one or two benches, is conducive to working in an efficient way. 5. Start with the intended outcome Efficiency improvements will be constrained by the output requirements of the lab and process planning and method development should start from the required output.  Knowing your aim and working backwards saves the wasted time and effort of getting to the end of writing up a method only to realise that it isn t possible to process as many samples as you need to. 6. Make inventory levels visible Instead of filling every inch of available storage space with cardboard boxes, consider using see-through storage boxes so that it is obvious when stocks are running low. Plus, cardboard is a hive of activity for all manner of fungi and other nasties that would like nothing more than to interfere with your assays at a moment s notice.  Equipment 7. Plan your equipment requirements in advance Having an equipment calendar makes it much easier to ensure that everyone has what they need, when they need it.  There are plenty of free shared online calendars that can be accessed by everyone in the lab to allow them to plan ahead.   8. Look for new products that can increase throughput There are plenty of new laboratory products available every year, seeking to increase sample throughput and make protocols more efficient. Keep an eye out for the new generation of programmable lab equipment (such as the Vitl Co-Mix) that allows you to set a protocol and leave the unit running for hours or even days without requiring supervision.   Don t always assume that the big players have all of the answers. If you have suggestions for an improvement to a product that would benefit your method, smaller, more flexible manufacturers may well be able to modify their equipment to better suit you.  9. See your equipment as a long-term investment From pipettes to complex HPLCs, life science laboratory equipment should be viewed as an investment. If your output demand was to double in a year s time, could your current equipment still meet your needs?  Equally, rank the quality of the instrument against your needs. If you are buying something that you are going to use all day, every day, perhaps spending a little extra on something well-built will be better in the long run than going for the  cheap and cheerful  option that needs to be replaced every few months.  10. Maintain your equipment  As well as being fit-for-purpose now and in the future, consider how your equipment will be maintained. Without regular maintenance and servicing, even the most well-engineered equipment will operate less efficiently (you wouldn t buy a car that had no service history!).  Worse still, an equipment fault that rendered your key piece of instrumentation unusable would have disastrous consequences for your throughput.","Published: July 13, 2015"

Comprising just 30 letters of genetic code, piRNA are only found within cells in the reproductive organs of animals, where ensuring the stability and integrity of DNA is of particularly vital importance. They bond to proteins called PIWI and guide them to the messenger RNA produced by the jumping genes, which the PIWI protein then destroys. They are also able to guide PIWI proteins to the jumping gene in the nucleus, which the PIWI protein silences, preventing it from creating more jumping gene RNA. Although piRNAs have been known about for many years, scientists have until now had very little understanding of exactly how the piRNAs that guide PIWI proteins to jumping genes in the nucleus are produced.In germline cells PIWI proteins silence RNA from jumping genes by cutting them in sequences of ~30 nucleotides that will become piRNAs. These bind to a nuclear PIWI protein to repress the expression of the jumping gene in the nucleus. IMAGE: Ramesh Pillai/EMBL The research, which involved groups from EMBL Grenoble and CEA-Grenoble, tracked the action of piRNA by inserting an artificial  jumping gene  into a fruit fly germ cell. The scientists were able to see the piRNA bind to a jumping gene messenger RNA in the cell s cytoplasm and to the PIWI protein, which then cut the first section from the jumping gene mRNA to silence it. But destroying the jumping gene mRNA was only the start of the process, as the team discovered. The PIWI protein and piRNA then continued to work their way along the jumping gene   in a process dubbed  inchworming  by the researchers   cutting off 30 letters of code at a time and converting these into new piRNAs. The new piRNAs were then loaded onto a PIWI protein that was able to travel to the cell nucleus, where the piRNAs could recognise the jumping gene within the DNA, enabling the PIWI protein to silence it.  We expected simply to see the jumping gene being silenced in the cytoplasm, so were really surprised to see it get converted into new piRNAs that were specifically loaded onto the PIWI protein that silences transposons in the nucleus,  explains Ramesh Pillai, from EMBL Grenoble.  Creating copies clearly increases the number of piRNAs that are able to recognise that particular jumping gene, as they retain the  memory  of the original. This means that once the PIWI protein from the nucleus is loaded with the new piRNAs, it s able to target the right gene in the DNA and silence it more efficiently.  While jumping genes provide some benefits, uncontrolled changes in the DNA of reproductive cells can lead to sterility. The team, involving Radha Raman Pandey and David Homolka from the Pillai lab, is now investigating whether the piRNAs follow the same  inchworm  process within mammalian cells, to take them a step closer to understanding the process within humans","Published: July 13, 2015"

They can divide without cease, invade distant tissues and consume glucose at abnormal rates. Now a study by University of Pennsylvania researchers implicates defects in mitochondria, the energy-production centers of cells, as playing a key role in the transition from normal to cancerous. When the Penn scientists disrupted a key component of mitochondria, otherwise normal cells took on characteristics of cancerous tumor cells. The research is published in the journal Oncogene and was led by members of the lab of Narayan G. Avadhani, the Harriet Ellison Woodward Professor of Biochemistry in Penn s School of Veterinary Medicine s Department of Biomedical Sciences, in collaboration with the lab of Hiroshi Nakagawa from the Gastroenterology Division in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine. Satish Srinivasan, a research investigator in Avadhani s lab, was the lead author. Manti Guha, Dawei Dong and Gordon Ruthel of Penn Vet and Kelly A. Whelan of Penn Medicine also contributed, along with Yasuto Uchikado and Shoji Natsugoe of Japan s Kagoshima University. In 1924, German biologist Otto Heinrich Warburg observed that cancerous cells consumed glucose at a higher rate than normal cells and had defects in their  grana,  the organelles that are now known as mitochondria. He postulated that the mitochondrial defects led to problems in the process by which the cell produces energy, called oxidative phosphorylation, and that these defects contributed to the cells becoming cancerous.  The first part of the Warburg hypothesis has held up solidly in that most proliferating tumors show high dependence on glucose as an energy source and they release large amounts of lactic acid,  Avadhani said.  But the second part, about the defective mitochondrial function causing cells to be tumorigenic, has been highly contentious.  To see whether the second part of Warburg s postulation was correct, the Penn-led research team took cell lines from the skeleton, kidney, breast and esophagus and used RNA molecules to silence the expression of select components of the mitochondrias  cytochrome oxidase C, or CcO, a critical enzyme involved in oxidative phosphorylation. CcO uses oxygen to make water and set up a transmembrane potential that is used to synthesize ATP, the molecule used for energy by the body s cells. The biologists observed that disrupting only a single protein subunit of cytochrome oxidase C led to major changes in the mitochondria and in the cells themselves.  These cells showed all the characteristics of cancer cells,  Avadhani said. They displayed changes in their metabolism, becoming more reliant on glucose and reducing their synthesis of ATP. Instead of conducting oxidative phosphorylation, they largely switched over to conducting glycolysis, a less efficient means of making ATP that is common in cancer cells. The cells lost contact inhibition and gained an increased ability to invade distant tissues, both  hallmarks of cancer cells,  Avadhani noted. When they were grown in a 3D medium, which closely mimics the natural environment in which tumors grow in the body, the cells with disrupted mitochondria formed large, long-lived colonies, akin to tumors. The researchers also silenced cytochrome oxidase C subunits in an already-tumorigenic breast and esophageal cancer cell lines.  We found that the cells became even more invasive, heightening their malignant potency,  Srinivasan said. Finally the Penn team looked at actual tumors from human patients and found that the most oxygen-starved regions, which are common in tumors, contained defective versions of cytochrome oxidase.  That result alone couldn t tell us whether that was the cause or effect of tumors, but our cell system clearly says that mitochondrial dysfunction is a driving force in tumorigenesis,  Avadhani said. The researchers observed that disrupting CcO triggered the mitochondria to activate a stress signal to the nucleus, akin to an  SOS  alerting the cell that something is amiss. Avadhani and his colleagues had previously seen a similar pathway activated in cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA, which is also linked to cancer. Building on these findings, Avadhani and members of his lab will examine whether inhibiting components of this mitochondrial stress signaling pathway might be a strategy for preventing cancer progression.  We are targeting the signaling pathway, developing a lot of small molecules and antibodies,  Avadhani said.  Hopefully if you block the signaling the cells will not go into the so called oncogenic mode and instead would simply die.  In addition, they noted that looking for defects in cytochrome oxidase C could be a biomarker for cancer screening. The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Harriet Ellison Woodward Trust.","Published: July 13, 2015"

PharmAthene has agreed to work exclusively with Immunovaccine to develop an adjuvanted non-alum based rPA vaccine. In return, Immunovaccine has granted PharmAthene exclusive worldwide rights to use DepoVax. The platform is designed to provide controlled and prolonged exposure of antigens plus adjuvant to the immune system, resulting in a strong, specific, and sustained immune response with the potential for single-dose effectiveness. According to Immunovaccine, DepoVax can be used with a broad range of target antigens for preventative or therapeutic applications. The technology is designed to be commercially scalable, with the potential for years of shelf life stability.  This type of strategic partnership will allow us to capitalize on the broad potential of the DepoVax platform in infectious disease while advancing core opportunities for DepoVax  in immuno-oncology,  Immunovaccine CEO Marc Mansour said in a statement.  This collaboration with PharmAthene has the potential for efficient and rapid development of a best-in-class anthrax vaccine.  Under the licensing deal, PharmAthene agreed to pay Immunovaccine annual payments of $200,000, up to $8 million tied to achieving development, U.S. and international regulatory milestones, and initial product sales, as well as up to $42 million tied to achieving sales targets a total of up to $50 million if all milestones are achieved. Immunovaccine will also receive a royalty on net sales, and will not be responsible for product development costs, the company said. The agreement comes a few months after Mansour told investors in the company s first quarter  Management s Report on Financial Position and Operating Results  that Immunovaccine was  actively seeking commercial partnerships with the owner of an anthrax antigen  to advance the program, following positive preclinical results. In January, Immunovaccine said a study led by the NIH demonstrated that three different rPA vaccines formulated with DepoVax protected animals against a lethal anthrax challenge after a single vaccination. PharmAthene s rPA is the active component antigen of the company s clinical-stage SparVax  anthrax vaccine. The second rPA anthrax vaccine is being developed to protect against inhalation anthrax, and contains a single, highly purified protein or  protective antigen  produced using a standard production strain of E.coli. According to PharmAthene, SparVax has been shown to stimulate protection against anthrax by eliciting a specific immune response to one of the primary proteins excreted by the Bacillus anthracisorganism. SparVax has been studied in one Phase I and two Phase II clinical trials completed to date, and involving more than 700 healthy human subjects.","Published: July 13, 2015"

These basic computing elements will allow the bacteria to sense, memorize, and respond to signals in the gut, with future applications that might include the early detection and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. Researchers have previously built genetic circuits inside model organisms such as E. coli. However, such strains are only found at low levels within the human gut, according to Timothy Lu, an associate professor of biological engineering and of electrical engineering and computer science, who led the research alongside Christopher Voigt, a professor of biological engineering at MIT.  We wanted to work with strains like B. thetaiotaomicron that are present in many people in abundant levels, and can stably colonize the gut for long periods of time,  Lu said. The illustration depicts Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (white) living on mammalian cells in the gut (large pink cells coated in microvilli) and being activated by exogenously added chemical signals (small green dots) to express specific genes, such as those encoding light-generating luciferase proteins (glowing bacteria).Copyright: Janet Iwasa The team developed a series of genetic parts that can be used to precisely program gene expression within the bacteria.  Using these parts, we built four sensors that can be encoded in the bacterium s DNA that respond to a signal to switch genes on and off inside B. thetaiotaomicron,  Voigt said. These can be food additives, including sugars, which allow the bacteria to be controlled by the food that is eaten by the host, Voigt adds. Bacterial  memory  To sense and report on pathologies in the gut, including signs of bleeding or inflammation, the bacteria will need to remember this information and report it externally. To enable them to do this, the researchers equipped B. thetaiotaomicron with a form of genetic memory. They used a class of proteins known as recombinases, which can record information into bacterial DNA by recognizing specific DNA addresses and inverting their direction. The researchers also implemented a technology known as CRISPR interference, which can be used to control which genes are turned on or off in the bacterium. The researchers used it to modulate the ability of B. thetaiotaomicron to consume a specific nutrient and to resist being killed by an antimicrobial molecule. The researchers demonstrated that their set of genetic tools and switches functioned within B. thetaiotaomicron colonizing the gut of mice. When the mice were fed food containing the right ingredients, they showed that the bacteria could remember what the mice ate. Expanded toolkit The researchers now plan to expand the application of their tools to different species of Bacteroides. That is because the microbial makeup of the gut varies from person to person, meaning that a particular species might be the dominant bacteria in one patient, but not in others.  We aim to expand our genetic toolkit to a wide range of bacteria that are important commensal organisms in the human gut,  Lu said. The concept of using microbes to sense and respond to signs of disease could also be used elsewhere in the body, he adds. In addition, more advanced genetic computing circuits could be built upon this genetic toolkit in Bacteroides to enhance their performance as noninvasive diagnostics and therapeutics.  For example, we want to have high sensitivity and specificity when diagnosing disease with engineered bacteria,  Lu said.  To achieve this, we could engineer bacteria to detect multiple biomarkers, and only trigger a response when they are all present.  Tom Ellis, group leader of the Centre for Synthetic Biology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the research, said the paper takes many of the best tools that have been developed for synthetic biology applications with E. coli and moves them over to use with a common class of gut bacteria.  Whereas others have developed tools and applications for engineering genetic circuits, or biosensors, in bacteria that are then placed in the gut, this paper stands out from the crowd by first engineering a member of the Bacteroides genus, the most common type of bacteria found in our guts,  Ellis said. The study has so far shown the efficacy of the approach in mice, and there will be a long road ahead before it can be approved for use in humans, Ellis said. However, the paper really opens up the possibility of one day having engineered cells resident in our guts for long periods of time, he said.  These could do tasks like sensing and recording, or even in-situ synthesis of therapeutic molecules as and when they are needed. ","Published: July 13, 2015"

But survival isn t always that simple. For example, when food gets scarce, B. subtilis must decide between two possible paths: shut down, form a dormant spore   a process called  sporulation    and wait for better times or split into two cells and gamble that there is enough food for at least one more generation.  The decision about whether to form a spore and when is a very important one for B. subtilis,  said Oleg Igoshin, associate professor of bioengineering at Rice and one of the lead researchers on the new study.  If the organism waits too long, it can starve before it finishes transforming into a spore. If it acts too early and forms a spore too soon, it can be overwhelmed and out-reproduced by competitors. Igoshin s lab specializes in describing the workings of the complex genetic regulatory networks that cells use to make such decisions. He said dozens of studies over the past 25 years have identified a network of more than 30 genes that B. subtilis uses to bring about sporulation. When food is plentiful, this network is largely silent. But during times of starvation the genes work in concert to form a spore. B. subtilis is harmless to humans, but some dangerous bacteria like Bacillus anthracis, the organism that causes anthrax, also form spores by a similar mechanism. Scientists are keen to better understand the process, both to protect public health and to explore the evolution of complex genetic processes. The exact workings of the sporulation network are complex. In 2012, Igoshin and graduate student Jatin Narula analyzed a genetic circuit downstream of the protein known as Spo0A, the  sporulation master regulator,  to explain how the network filters out noisy fluctuations in Spo0A activity. By filtering out noise, cells are able to accurately determine if Spo0A activity is above the threshold that triggers sporulation. In the new study, Narula, Igoshin and collaborators set out to explain how B. subtilis times its sporulation decision with its cell-division cycle, a programmed series of events that cells normally follow to reproduce.  Successful sporulation requires two complete copies of the bacterial chromosome, so coordination between the sporulation decision and the completion of DNA replication is very important,  Narula said.  A good analogy might be a semester-long course in biology. Lessons are presented in a particular order, and students are tested after they learn. If the final exam were given in the first week, students would almost certainly fail.  Igoshin said that when the researchers set out to find how sporulation decisions were timed to the cell cycle, several studies including prior work by team members, provided a significant clue: Under starvation conditions, the activity of the master regulator gene had been shown to spike once per cell cycle. In investigating how this spike occurred, Narula pored through dozens of published studies and noticed a discrepancy between some experimental results and the widely accepted view of the interactions between two key players in the sporulation network, a protein called Spo0F and a kinase called KinA. To resolve this discrepancy, Narula built a mathematical model in which excess Spo0F inhibits KinA activity. The new model showed that changes in the ratio of KinA to Spo0F could produce the pulse similar to those seen in experiments.  The inhibition of KinA by 0F results in a  negative feedback loop,  which means the circuit output works to counteract the input that triggers it,  said Narula, co-lead author of the study.  Such loops are common in engineered and biological systems and usually work to keep things relatively constant despite external perturbations.  A simple example of negative feedback would be the thermostat on your house. When temperature drops it will keep your heater on until the temperature is back to normal. If there is a delay in the feedback loop, the system may overreact and produce a surge. With the thermostat, for example, if the heating unit continues to run for some time after the desired temperature is reached, the temperature can transiently spike before settling back to the desired level.  Igoshin and Narula said similar spikes appear to be a consequence of the delayed negative feedback loop in the network that controls the amount of the active Spo0A. Furthermore, these spikes were timed based upon the positions of the KinA and Spo0F genes on the bacterial genome. To divide and reproduce, bacteria must make a duplicate copy of their DNA. Because replication of circular bacterial DNA always initiates at one particular point, Narula surmised that the location of the KinA and Spo0F genes could be crucial. If one were located near the point where DNA replication began, the cell would contain two copies of that gene   doubling the rate of production of that protein   throughout the DNA replication period. If the other gene were located on the part of the circle that was copied last, the ratio of KinA to Spo0F would be one-to-one only when DNA replication was nearly completed. Igoshin and Narula used a mathematical model of the network to show that this type of gene arrangement could account for spikes in Spo0A activity after each round of DNA replication. To verify their idea, they teamed with experimental biologists Anna Kuchina, co-lead author of the study, and G rol S el, co-lead investigator, both of the University of California at San Diego. Experiments showed that the spikes of Spo0A activity always followed completion of DNA replication as the model predicted. In addition, Kuchina and colleagues used biotechnology to engineer mutant forms of B. subtilis in which the two critical genes were located near one another. The Spo0A spike from the delayed negative feedback loop was not observed in the mutants, and they failed to produce spores. In another engineered strain, the feedback loop between Spo0A and Spo0F was eliminated. This led to a gradual increase in Spo0A activity as opposed to a spike, and such cells were several times more likely to fail or die during sporulation.  We found that the relative location of sporulation genes on the DNA circle were similar in more than 30 species of spore-forming bacteria, including Bacillus anthracis,  Igoshin said.  This evidence suggests that the DNA timing mechanism is highly conserved, and it is possible that other time-critical functions related to the cell cycle may be regulated in a similar way.

High grade brain tumors, known as gliomas, are difficult to treat with only a single digit five-year survival rate. Most patients treated for primary gliomas develop into secondary gliomas, which are almost always fatal. ""Any given tumor can harbor a variety of different combinations of mutations,"" said Moise Danielpour, MD, Vera and Paul Guerin Family Chair in Pediatric Neurosurgery, director of the Pediatric Neurosurgery Program and the Center for Pediatric Neurosciences in the Maxine Dunitz Children's Health Center and last author on the study. ""Despite advances in radiation and chemotherapy, there are currently no effective curative regimens for treatment for these diverse tumors."" Researchers first modeled high grade brain tumors from resident stem cells inside the brain, using a cutting edge method of rapid modeling that can create up to five distinct tumor models within 45 minutes. After effectively modeling high grade brain tumors, researchers identified the Ets family of genes as contributors to glioma brain tumors. These Ets factors function to regulate the behavior of tumor cells by controlling expression of genes necessary for tumor growth and cell fate. When expression of the Ets genes is blocked, researchers can identify and strategize novel treatment therapies. ""The ability to rapidly model unique combinations of driver mutations from a patient's tumor enhances our quest to create patient-specific animal models of human brain tumors,"" added Danielpour. Immediate next steps involve testing the function of each individual Ets factor to determine their specific role in tumor progression and recurrence after treatment.","Published: July 13, 2015"

The microbiota is involved in many mechanisms, including digestion, vitamin synthesis and host defense. It is well established that a loss of bacterial symbionts promotes the development of allergies.  The hygiene hypothesis suggests a link between the decline in infectious diseases and the increase in allergic diseases in industrialized countries. Improvements in hygiene levels necessarily lead to reduced contact with microbes that is paralleled by an increased incidence in allergic and autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes.  A cluster of type 3 cells (shown in green) in a mouse colon. These cells are induced by the microbiota and block type 2 allergic reactions.   Institut Pasteur.  However, until now, the biological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remained unclear. In this study the team led by G rard Eberl (head of the Microenvironment and Immunity Unit at the Institut Pasteur) shows that, in mice, symbiotic intestinal microbes act on the immune system by blocking allergic reactions.   Several types of immune response can be generated in order to defend the organism. The presence of bacterial or fungal microbes provokes a response from immune cells known as type 3 cells. These immune cells coordinate the phagocytosis and killing of the microbes. However, in the case of infection by pathogenic agents that are too large to be handled by type 3 cells (such as parasitic worms and certain allergens), the cells that organize the elimination of the pathogen, but also allergic reactions, are known as type 2 cells.    In this study, scientists at the Institut Pasteur have shown that type 3 cells activated during a microbial aggression act directly on type 2 cells and block their activity. Type 2 cells are consequently unable to generate allergic immune responses. This work demonstrates that the microbiota indirectly regulates type 2 immune responses by inducing type 3 cells.   These results explain how an imbalance in microbiota triggers an exaggerated type 2 immune response normally used to fight large parasites, but that also leads to allergic responses.   These findings represent an important milestone in understanding the balance between our various defense mechanisms. In terms of allergy treatment, a hitherto unexplored therapeutic approach consists therefore in stimulating type 3 cells by mimicking a microbial antigen in order to block allergy-causing type 2 cells.

Obesity, which is on the rise, is thought to contribute to the development of NASH. The disease has no symptoms that most people notice, and testing for it requires a needle biopsy of the liver, so it often goes undetected. Current estimates indicate that between 6 and 17 percent of Americans have NASH. John Clarke, research associate, and Nathan Cherrington, professor, both of the college s Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, recently published a study showing that a mouse model of obesity, diabetes and NASH retained the anti-diabetic drug metformin longer than a control group of healthy mice. The study,  Mechanism of Altered Metformin Distribution in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis,  found that NASH can change the way that drugs are eliminated from the body, potentially leading to toxic levels of metformin being retained in the body.  This study, in addition to several of our other recent studies,  Clarke says,  shows that NASH, either alone or in combination with genetic differences in drug transporters, can have a profound effect on drug exposure.  Cherrington notes that this study is about the mechanism explaining how NASH changes the body s ability to get rid of metformin. The next step is to continue this investigation in the clinic to demonstrate the metformin-retention phenomenon in human patients with type 2 diabetes.  If any clinician is going to provide precision medicine, they ll need to know the ability of the liver and kidneys to metabolize and eliminate drugs,  he emphasizes. More than 110,000 people are estimated to die each year from adverse drug reactions, which is when the correct drug is given in an appropriate dose, but the patient experiences an unexpected serious adverse event. Metformin is still a relatively safe drug and effective therapy; more than 48 million prescriptions were filled for metformin in the United States in 2010. Because the study showed that patients with NASH retain metformin longer and at higher levels, leading to potential toxicity, NASH could explain some of these adverse drug reactions. This study may lead to individual treatment strategies where patients get the appropriate dose of metformin based on their ability to metabolize and eliminate the drug.","Published: July 13, 2015"

Antivenom, also known as antivenin, is used to prevent death or illness from a poisonous snakebite.  Believe me, if you get bit by a poisonous snake such as a diamondback rattlesnake, you will be glad that an antivenom is available,  he said. Seven types of venomous snakes can be found in Oklahoma, including cottonmouths and copperheads. The diamondback rattlesnake has the most potent venom, according to the Oklahoma Center for Poison and Drug Information. Every year, about 7,000-8,000 people receive venomous snake bites in the U.S. Because people regularly seek medical care for snake bites, they only result in about five deaths each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using a method called size exclusion chromatography, Sanny is analyzing how venom and antivenom bind together. The chemical interaction could hold clues on how to improve antivenom. The venom must bind with antivenom to provide any protection against death, he said. Large molecular complexes are formed when antivenom and venom combine. Sanny uses size exclusion chromatography to separate the large venom-antivenom complexes from unreacted venom molecules to determine how effective the antivenom is in binding venom molecules.  Serum sickness can take place when the antivenem antibodies are too large,  Sanny said.  Our immune systems can recognize the sheep or horse antibodies as foreign molecules and attack the antibodies.  Most commercially available antivenoms today contain smaller sized antibody fragments that still bind to venom but are not as likely to produce serum sickness. Only one commercial antivenom for poisonous snakes, like rattlesnakes, is currently available in the United States.  Understanding the biochemistry of venom and antivenin reactions will have a direct impact on the ability of physicians, especially family and emergency room physicians, to provide treatment,  said OSU-CHS President Kayse Shrum, D.O.

Analyzing blood for ions, such as electrolytes or basic nutrients like iron, currently requires drawing several milliliters of blood and removing large molecules and cells via methods like centrifugation. But Kei Toda of Kumamoto University, in Japan, and his colleagues devised a method that needs little blood and eliminates the separation step, all with a device only about 3 cm2. The scientists place a drop of human blood into a sample well, below which lies a dialysis membrane that keeps out large molecules and cells and another membrane that allows either positively or negatively charged ions to pass through. They apply an electric field for a minute, drawing ions of that charge through the membranes into water on the other side, which they then analyze using ion chromatography-mass spectrometry for ions of interest. The team used the method to measure levels of iodide, an important nutrient for thyroid hormone development, in blood drops collected from 16 volunteers. The levels tracked what would be expected: Volunteers who reported eating iodide-rich miso soup with seaweed carried more than 10- g/L iodide in their blood, while others carried 3 8  g/L. The team also measured thiocyanate a smoking biomarker and found it was four times as concentrated in the blood of smokers as in nonsmokers. Because it requires less blood, the new method could allow for more frequent measurements and thus better characterization of how these ions fluctuate in the blood over a day or after particular exposures.

The nanoparticles are filled with genes for an enzyme that converts a prodrug called ganciclovir into a potent destroyer of the glioma cells. Glioma is one of the most lethal human cancers, with a five year survival rate of just 12%, and no reliable treatment. Advances in the understanding of the molecular processes that cause these tumors has resulted in therapies aimed at delivering specific genes into tumors -- genes that make proteins to kill or suppress the growth of the tumor. Currently this approach relies heavily on using viruses to deliver the anti-tumor genes into the target cancer cells. Unfortunately, viral delivery poses significant safety risks including toxicity, activation of the patient's immune system against the virus, and the possibility of the virus itself encouraging tumors to develop. ""Efforts to treat glioma with traditional drug and radiation therapies have not been very successful,"" says Jessica Tucker, Ph.D., NIBIB Director for the Program in Gene and Drug Delivery Systems and Devices. ""The ability to successfully deliver genes using these biodegradable nanoparticles, rather than potentially harmful viruses, is a significant step that reinvigorates the potential for gene therapy to treat deadly gliomas as well as other cancers."" Jordan Green, Ph.D., of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Biomedical Engineering Department and a senior author of the work, and his international team describe their findings in the February 24 issue of ACS Nano. The collaborators include colleagues from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Departments of Neurosurgery, Oncology, Ophthalmology, and Pathology, as well as Tang Du Hospital in China, University of the Negevin, Israel, and the Instituto Neurologico C. Besta in Italy. Biodegradable nanoparticles have recently shown promise as a method to deliver genes into cells. Their use for delivery avoids many of the problems associated with viral gene delivery. To demonstrate virus free delivery, the first goal of the group was to develop a nanoparticle that could efficiently carry DNA encoding a gene known as HSVtk into cells. The HSVtk gene produces an enzyme that turns the compound ganciclovir--which by itself has no effect on cancer cells -- into a compound that is toxic to actively dividing brain cancer cells. A number of polymer structures were tested for their ability to deliver DNA into two rat glioma cell lines. Among the many polymers tried, the one known as PBAE 447 was found to be the most efficient in delivering the HSVtk gene into the cultured rat glioma cells. Furthermore, when combined with ganciclovir, the HSVtk-encoding nanoparticles were 100% effective in killing both of the glioma cell lines grown in the laboratory. Next, the gene therapy system was tested in live rats with brain gliomas. Because it is important that the nanoparticles spread throughout the entire tumor, they were infused into the rat gliomas using convection-enhanced delivery (CED). The method involves injection into the tumor and the application of a pressure gradient, which efficiently disperses the nanoparticles throughout the tumors. To test the tumor-killing ability of the system, the tumor-bearing rats were given systemic administration of ganciclovir for two days, then CED was used to infuse the HSVtk-encoding nanoparticles into the rat gliomas, and systemic ganciclovir treatment continued for eight more days. The treatment resulted in shrinkage of the tumors and a significant increase in survival when compared with control glioma-bearing animals that did not receive the combination treatment. ""The results provide the first demonstration of a successful non-viral nanomedicine method for HSVtk/ganciclovir treatment of brain cancer,"" stated Green. ""Next steps will include enhancing the efficiency of this nanoparticle delivery system and evaluating the technology in additional brain cancer animal models."" In the future, the investigators envision that doctors would administer this therapy during the surgery commonly used to treat glioma in humans. They are also interested in testing the ability to deliver other cancer-killing genes and whether the nanoparticles could be successfully administered systemically -- which could broaden the use of the therapy for a wide range of solid tumors and systemic cancers.

The collaboration will start immediately and is based on combinations of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, developed at the laboratory of Prof Hinrich Abken against multiple tumor-associated antigens, and apceth-developed engineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). apceth is developing autologous (patient-derived) and allogeneic (off-the-shelf) engineered MSCs that migrate to tumors and sites of injury or inflammation, based on their natural homing capabilities, where they express therapeutic transgenes. CART cells are based on T-cells taken from patients and engineered to target and destroy tumor cells that express specific markers. The specificity is dictated by the CARs they express, which also enable them to become activated. The activation, however, is not usually optimal, due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This collaboration will focus on the use of engineered MSCs to promote the local activation of CART cells within tumors. The approach will therefore increase the specificity of CART immunotherapies, as activation of CART cells will be limited outside of tumors. Dr. Christine G nther, CEO of apceth, commented:  Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer care and brought hope to many patients. However, the tumor specificity of many of these approaches remains suboptimal. We see the powerful combination of apceth gmMSCs with CARTs as a great opportunity to overcome some of these barriers and boost the specificity and clinical efficacy of CART cell approaches. We are delighted to be working alongside Prof Hinrich Abken, a pioneer in the field with tremendous experience in CART biology and see many synergies with apceth s gmMSC platform technology and our track record in preclinical and clinical development of genetically-modified cells for clinical trials.  Prof Abken, head of Tumor Genetics at the Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne and Professor at the Dept I for Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Cologne, is delighted to be cooperating with apceth:  Combining apceth s gmMSCs with CAR T-cells we developed in Cologne during the last decade may open new paths for the treatment of solid cancer. Tumors have evolved multiple strategies to resist an immune attack; we are aiming at focussing the power of the immune system towards the tumor lesion in a specific way while minimizing systemic side effects.  Under the terms of the agreement, apceth will develop and optimize gmMSCs that can generate a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. These will be combined with different CART cells developed by Prof Abken against multiple pre-agreed cancer-specific markers found on solid tumors and haematological malignancies and tested in various preclinical models. Successful candidates will be optimized and further developed for clinical trials.","Published: July 11, 2015"

Stress resiliency and susceptibility: The neurocircuitry underlying the detrimental effects of chronic stress Humans are remarkably resilient when confronted with tremendous amounts of stress and trauma. While most people are able to maintain balanced psychological and physical functioning, some people are vulnerable, or susceptible, to the negative biological, psychological, and social consequences of stress. The biological factors underlying susceptibility are unknown and likely intersect with an individual s ability to cope, among other factors.

But just why the immune system begins its misdirected assault has remained a mystery.

However, these cells are a ""double edged sword"" in spinal cord injury, providing both neural repair-promoting properties and pathological functions that destroy neuronal tissue ""We know from previous research that macrophages are versatile, and signals at the injury site can stimulate repair or destruction--or confusingly, both,"" said John Gensel Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Physiology in the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center at the University of Kentucky. ""But the mechanisms through which these signals stimulate the good and/or bad functions in macrophages are not known. So the next big question to answer in the efforts to understand and treat SCI was, 'Why?'"" Gensel teamed up with Phillip Popovich, Ph.D, Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Director of the Center for Brain and Spinal Cord Repair (CBSCR) at The Ohio State University to explore the mechanisms governing the positive and negative processes that occur in macrophages following spinal cord injury. ""On the cellular level, the body's response to spinal cord injury is similar to the immune response to attacks by bacteria or viruses,"" Gensel said. ""The functions that macrophages adopt in response to these stimuli were the focus of our study."" Gensel and Popovich looked at more than 50 animals with spinal cord injury to try to identify which macrophage receptors promoted neuronal repair and which directed the destructive process. ""We found that activating bacterial receptors boosted the macrophage response and limited damage to the spinal cord following injury, while activating fungal receptors actually contributed to pathology,"" Gensel said. While this study oversimplifies the complex process by which macrophages promote repair and destruction of neuronal tissues, it nonetheless sheds light on opportunities to modulate macrophage responses after spinal cord injury, potentially reducing -- or even reversing -- damage and the resulting side-effects.

Normal blood flow regulation allows the brain to redistribute blood to areas of the brain that have increased activity while performing certain tasks,  said study author Vera Novak, MD, PhD, of Harvard Medical School in Boston.  People with type 2 diabetes have impaired blood flow regulation. Our results suggest that diabetes and high blood sugar impose a chronic negative effect on cognitive and decision-making skills.  The study involved 40 people with an average age of 66. Of those, 19 had type 2 diabetes and 21 did not have diabetes. Those with diabetes had been treated for the disease for an average of 13 years. The participants were tested at the beginning of the study and again two years later. Tests included cognition and memory tests, MRI scans of the brain to look at brain volume and blood flow, and blood tests to measure control of blood sugar and inflammation. After two years, the people with diabetes had decreases in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain. They also had lower scores on several tests of memory and thinking skills. People with lower ability to regulate blood flow at the beginning of the study had greater declines in a measure of how well they could complete daily activities such as bathing and cooking. Higher levels of inflammation were also associated with greater decreases in blood flow regulation, even if people had good control of their diabetes and blood pressure, Novak said. On a test of learning and memory, the scores of the people with diabetes decreased by 12 percent, from 46 points to 41 points over the two years of the study, while the scores of those without diabetes stayed the same, at 55 points. Blood flow regulation in the brain was decreased by 65 percent in people with diabetes.  Early detection and monitoring of blood flow regulation may be an important predictor of accelerated changes in cognitive and decision-making skills,  Novak said. She said additional studies involving more people and extending for a longer time period are needed to better understand the relationship and timing with blood flow regulation and changes in thinking and memory skills.

Researchers at the University of California (UC), San Diego say they have identified a region of the brain that enables you to do that -- and generally helps you navigate the world. Douglas Nitz, associate professor of cognitive science in the UC San Diego Division of Social Sciences, and graduate student Andrew Alexander worked with rats, aka ""navigational geniuses,"" recording the firing activity of neurons while the animals ran on a zigzag track in different locations, to show that the retrosplenial cortex appears to be critical in putting together all the information necessary for successfully getting from point A to point B. They describe their findings in a paper in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The world we and other animals navigate is complex and non-linear, quite unlike the way a proverbial crow flies. The authors say our ability to get around its numerous indirect points depends, at minimum, on mapping our position within the environment, knowing routes that take us between locations, and an awareness of the correct actions to initiate at any given time: turn right, turn left, go straight. Currently, we know that cells encoding these different forms of spatial knowledge are stored in different neural structures. Place cells and grid cells are neurons in the hippocampal circuit that are responsible for mapping the position of an animal with respect to the broader environment. (This is the ""inner GPS"" system whose discovery, by John O'Keefe, Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser, was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). Meanwhile, Nitz and other researchers have found neurons in the parietal cortex that generate complex representations of the animal's position along a route and cells that encode route-related actions. ""But ultimately,"" said Nitz, ""these different forms of spatial information, generated in distinct structures, must be combined and related to each other in an organized fashion in order for an agent to effectively move through the world. Our study shows that the retrosplenial cortex is an area of the brain that is simultaneously sensitive to mapping interior and exterior spaces and may be a kind of 'conjunction junction,' putting together all the necessary information for successful navigation."" The retrosplenial cortex, which sits in the brain between the parietal and the hippocampus and is vastly interconnected with both regions, has been hypothesized to be critical in this way. The present research, Nitz and Alexander believe, is the first laboratory demonstration of the hypothesis at the level of the cell. ""It's exciting,"" Alexander said, ""because it's the first real evidence of a brain region that's capable of interfacing really well-known forms of spatial mapping."" The study's results are consistent with computational modeling research and with clinical observations of people who have lesions in the retrosplenial, too. Damage to that area can produce problems with episodic memory and create ""directional amnesia,"" a situation where a person ""knows where things are in the world,"" Alexander said, ""but won't be able to place the route that they need to get between them."" The retrosplenial is also one of the very first parts of the brain to degenerate in the early stages of Alzheimer's, Nitz said. Learning more about the functions of that area of the brain might make it possible for us to devise simple navigation-based tests to spot the disease sooner. Another potential application of the findings, Nitz said, is in robotics. He is currently collaborating with a colleague at UC Irvine to create an artificial neural network with properties of the retrosplenial cortex so a robot might someday also solve the sorts of navigational problems we (and rats) routinely face.

The study, published online in Current Biology, opens the door to more precise studies of brain anatomy going forward and could eventually lead to more personalized medicine approaches for diagnosing and treating brain diseases.  If we can account for a large percentage of brain structure based on an individual s genes, we re in a better position to detect smaller variations in the brain that might be important in understanding disease or developmental issues,  said the study s senior author Anders Dale, PhD, professor of radiology, neurosciences, psychiatry and cognitive science, and director of the Center for Translational Imaging and Precision Medicine at UC San Diego. In their study, the researchers found they could predict with  a relatively high degree of accuracy an individual s genetic ancestry based on the geometry of their cerebral cortex.  They found no relationship between brain shape and functional or cognitive abilities, Dale said, but rather a trove of information about how minute differences in brain geometry could be correlated with genetic lineage.  The geometry of the brain s cortical surface contains rich information about ancestry,  said the study s first author, Chun Chieh Fan, MD, a graduate student in cognitive science.  Even in the modern contemporary U.S. population, with its melting pot of different cultures, it was still possible to correlate brain cortex structure to ancestral background.  Four continental populations were used as ancestral references: European, West African, East Asian and Native American. The metrics for summarizing genetic ancestry in each ancestral component were standardized as proportions ranging from 0 to 100 percent.  We looked to see how well we could predict how much genetic ancestry they had from Africa, Europe and so forth,  said study co-author Terry Jernigan, PhD, professor of cognitive science, psychiatry and radiology, adding that cortex differences between various lineages were focused in certain areas.  There were various systematic differences, particularly in the folding and gyrification patterns of the cortex,  said Jernigan, also director of the university s Center for Human Development.  Those patterns were quite strongly reflective of genetic ancestry.  The researchers reported that the cortical patterns accounted for 47 to 66 percent of the variation among individuals in their genetic ancestry, depending on the ancestral lineage. The researchers analyzed data from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics (PING) study, a major data collection project funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in 2009. The project collected neuroimaging and genotyping data from more than 1,200 children and adolescents at 10 sites in the United States to create a data repository to advance research efforts worldwide. UC San Diego was the coordinating center for the PING study and Dale and Jernigan were its co-principal investigators. Jernigan said the research team used a subset of PING data for the brain cortex study, analyzing genetic and neuroimaging information from 562 children aged 12 years and older, a group chosen because the cortex surface changes little after age 12. First, the genetic data for each of the individual children was analyzed to determine their different ancestral lineages. Next, the researchers took the children s neuroimaging scans and analyzed them using a sophisticated brain imaging analysis software suite, known as FreeSurfer, originally developed by Dale and colleagues at UC San Diego in 1993 and now widely used by the research community. The software used quantitative modeling and algorithms to map the shape of the cerebral cortex. The results were compared to the individuals  genetic data and patterns linked to genetic lineage emerged.  There was a lot of variability in our participant population,  said Jernigan, explaining that the children s genetic results ran along a continuum, where a child might be 40 percent one lineage and 60 percent another. Dale said the differences in cortex shapes between the various ancestries are  subtle, but systematic.  He said understanding these differences will be important in refining future brain research and also in creating appropriate standards of comparison for the various ancestral groups, and for those which are a mixture of different groups. Jernigan agreed:  In order to understand what might be abnormal for a particular individual, it is very important to control for the differences in brain structure that are simply reflective of genetic ancestry. We need to develop better genetically informed analysis for detecting abnormalities in the brain and for measuring differences in the brain that might account for disease symptoms. This study is a step in the right direction and has implications for how people conduct brain research going forward.

It is the first study to document that these genomic signatures of adaptation can help identify plants that will do well under certain stresses, such drought or toxic soils, said Geoff Morris, assistant professor of agronomy at Kansas State University and a researcher affiliated with the university's Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sorghum and Millet.  Researchers conducted the study with sorghum, one of the oldest and most widely grown cereal grain crops in the world. Sorghum is grown in Africa and Asia as well as in some of the world's harshest crop-growing regions. More than 43,000 sorghum varieties around the world have been collected and stored in crop gene banks, which are centers that serve as repositories for crop diversity.  ""While sorghum is grown in some of the toughest climates in the world, we need to continue to increase the amount of grain it produces and its resilience to harsh environments because nearly half a billion people depend on sorghum as a staple food source,"" Morris said. ""We want this important crop plant to produce more food and have less loss.""  Sampling from the crop gene banks, Morris and colleagues at Cornell University and the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics, or ICRISAT, took ""snapshots"" of genetic information in the genomes of about 2,000 sorghum varieties. Because each sorghum variety was from a particular known location in an African or Indian village, the researchers were able to tie the genetic differences of each variety to its survival in a particular environment.  With this data, Morris and colleague Jesse Lasky from Columbia University's Earth Institute were able to map each plant variety's ""genomic signature"" of environmental adaptation. This signature reflects how different plant varieties from around the world have adapted to stressors in their environment, such as drought and toxic metals in the soil.  The team then applied a drought stress to plants in the field to test whether genomic analysis could help predict what varieties would continue to thrive under drought. The team tested drought response in hundreds of different sorghum varieties at ICRISAT in India and at the University of Texas at Austin. Data showed that the genomic signatures identified what varieties were likely to do well under stress. Researchers cataloged the findings in a database that aims to help sorghum breeders with limited resources in developing countries have better predictions of what sorghum varieties will thrive in the environment and in a growing season's forecasted weather.

Such tools have been developed for other gut bacteria like Escherichia coliand Lactococcus lactis, but they are only present in the gut at low levels, the researchers noted, while B. thetaiotaomicron is typically more common. ""We wanted to work with strains like B. thetaiotaomicron that are present in many people in abundant levels, and can stably colonize the gut for long periods of time,"" said Lu, an associate professor of biological engineering, in a statement. Lu and his colleagues combined certain promoters and ribosome-binding sites to generate parts that could be used to engineer systems in B. thetaiotaomicron. They first constructed four promoter variants based on the bacterial constitutive promoter sigma factor BT1311 that, when tied to a luciferase reporter gene, exhibited a 20-fold range of gene expression. By adding these promoters to RBSs of varying strengths, the researchers also developed an RBS library that spans a more than 10,000-fold range of gene expression. To further fine-tune their control of bacterial gene expression, the researchers uncovered a set of eight RBS sequences that yielded a 1,000-fold gene-expression range at about even increments. ""Using these parts, we built four sensors that can be encoded in the bacterium's DNA that respond to a signal to switch genes on and off inside B. thetaiotaomicron,"" Christopher Voigt, a professor of biological engineering at MIT, said in a statement. For instance, the researchers took advantage of the B. thetaiotaomicronrhamnose metabolic pathway to generate a rhamnose-inducible system in which RhaR activates transcription at the PBT3763 promoter. To test this system, they paired it with a luciferase reporter gene, and they noted its expression was conditional upon rhamnose concentration. They also developed inducible systems based on Bacteroides hybrid two-component systems induced by chondroitin sulfate and arabinogalactan, respectively, as well as an isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible system based on the E. coli LacI system. Meanwhile, the MIT team also designed a serine integrase-based memory circuit   serine integrases catalyze unidirectional inversion of DNA between two recognition sequences   so that they'd have a signal to indicate when B. thetaiotaomicron encountered certain stimuli of interest, such as inflammation. After identifying serine integrases that work in B. thetaiotaomicron, the researchers placed one under the control of the rhamnose-inducible promoter to develop an inducible memory switch. This switch, the researchers reported, responded to increasing concentrations of rhamnose. To develop a more complex gene circuit, the researchers turned to a CRISPR interference-mediated system to knock down gene expression and affect the metabolic capacity of B. thetaiotaomicron and its resistance to certain antimicrobial peptides. For example, they designed a guide RNA to repress BT1754, which is essential for fructose metabolism, and integrated it into the B. thetaiotaomicron with an IPTG-inducible dCas9 cassette. Neither induction nor repression of BT175 affected growth on glucose media, the researchers reported, but its induction did decrease growth on MM-fructose. The researchers tested these systems out in the mouse gut, finding signs of luciferase activity in mouse feces when the mice were exposed to system triggers like arabinogalactan. In addition, the memory switch exhibited signs of switching after mice colonized with bacteria containing it were exposed to rhamnose. These tools, the researchers said, set the stage for microbiome engineering. They argued that B. thetaiotaomicron could be used to keep an eye on the gut microbiome and serve as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool. ""[W]e want to have high sensitivity and specificity when diagnosing disease with engineered bacteria,"" Lu said. ""To achieve this, we could engineer bacteria to detect multiple biomarkers, and only trigger a response when they are all present."" ","Published: July 10, 2015"

When we started working in the new field of genetic engineering 30 years ago, it was a struggle to explain our work to friends and family. Now people make jokes about DNA. Our struggle continued as we tried to explain what enzymes are. For the first years of NECi, chemists balked at the idea of enzymes for water testing. The inherent dangers and toxicity exposures of a chemistry lab were taken for granted   ever check out life insurance rates for chemists? Sensitivity to parts per million for many analytes was a great achievement of the second half of the 20th century, now detection limits down to single molecules is in the news these days. It s been clear that there s always room for the next improvement in the lab. But change is always hard. Displacing the tried-and-true is harder than adopting something never done before. And that s where we have seen the obstacles to adoption of enzyme-based analytical chemistry outside the biomedical or clinical lab. Advantages in selectivity (simplifying sample prep), sensitivity, and safety are finally gaining attention from the lab community. These trends are aiding NECi in recruiting a variety of stakeholders in collaborative efforts at new method validation.

Past research has shown the impact of commonly occurring genetic variants on a person's risk of developing schizophrenia. This new study focused instead on rare coding mutations that affect protein function. It found that patients with schizophrenia have a higher-than-normal share of these mutations. ""While we cannot point to specific mutations that play a causal role in schizophrenia, we show that schizophrenia patients collectively have more of these mutations than unaffected individuals,"" said Loes Olde Loohuis, the study's first author and a postdoctoral fellow at UCLA's Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics. The center is part of the university's Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior. The findings are reported in Nature Communications. ""Genes that are affected by these mutations play a key role in fetal brain development,"" said Roel Ophoff, the study's senior author and a principal investigator at the Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics. ""Our finding further supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a disorder that may originate during the early stages of brain development."" A professor of psychiatry and human genetics, Dr. Ophoff has conducted research on the genetic basis of schizophrenia for the past decade. He is also one of the founding members of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium's schizophrenia study group. The consortium is an international collaboration of researchers investigating the genetics of schizophrenia and related disorders. Schizophrenia affects some 2 to 3 million people in the U.S. -- about 1 percent of the population. It is characterized by hallucinations, delusions and disorganization, and can take a tremendous toll on patients and their families. Schizophrenia can cause a significant loss in quality of life, including unemployment and estrangement from loved ones. A better understanding of the causes of the disease may lead to better options for treating it. Ophoff and his colleagues used an array-based technology to screen for 250,000 DNA coding variants in more than 1000 schizophrenia patients from the Netherlands and compared these samples to those from unaffected individuals. They found that the patients with schizophrenia had more of these variants than patients without schizophrenia. The researchers confirmed these findings in another cohort consisting of more than 13,000 schizophrenia patients and control subjects from the UK.

PrPC is perhaps best known in its ""degenerate"" form, the prion, and an infectious agent behind dangerous neurodegenerative diseases such as mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).  The study, is published in the journal Scientific Reports. For some time, scientists have been wondering what the physiological role of PrP is in its normal physiological state. Previous studies suggested that among its functions, one was preventing the onset of seizure discharges in the brain (most likely by modulating the action of specific synaptic channels). However, some scientists had questioned the validity of the research. ""The idea in the past was that animal models were not specific enough and that the observations were the product of systematic, experimental error,"" says Prof. Giuseppe Legname of the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) of Trieste. Legname is one of the authors of the new study. ""With our work we wanted to dispel any doubt.

These genetic diseases attack myelin or the ""insulating rubber sheath"" surrounding neurons, which leads to deteriorating health for affected children. Today, nearly 20 types of leukodystrophies have been characterized, but many other forms remain undefined, leaving nearly 40 per cent of families awaiting a diagnosis. An international research team, led by Dr. Genevi ve Bernard from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) and Dr. Benoit Coulombe from the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr al (IRCM), has identified a new gene associated with 4H leukodystrophy, one of the common forms of the disease. Their findings have been published in Nature Communications. ""We are finally starting to better understand this terrible disease. By discovering mutations on this new gene called POLR1C, which account for nearly 10 per cent of cases with this type of leukodystrophy, we now have a better idea of the impact they have on nervous system cells,"" says one of the principal co-authors, Dr. Bernard, neurologist at the Montreal Children's Hospital of the MUHC (MCH-MUHC) at the Glen site and assistant professor of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University. ""My team and I had paved the way in 2011 by identifying two genes (POLR3A and POLR3B) responsible for 4H leukodystrophy, which represent about 85 per cent of patients with the disease. However, approximately 15 per cent of patients with this type of leukodystrophy lack a genetic diagnosis. Until now, we did not know why mutations on the previously-discovered genes caused leukodystrophy."" ""Indeed, we found that mutations on POLR1C caused a problem in the assembly and cellular localization of an enzyme, RNA polymerase III, which plays a very important role in the proper functioning of our cells,"" states the second principal co-author, Dr. Coulombe, full IRCM research professor and director of the Translational Proteomics research unit at the IRCM. ""The cells' lack of ability to produce RNA polymerase III compromises the genetic program controlled by this enzyme, thereby inducing a particularly harmful effect in specialized nerve cells."" According to Dr. Coulombe, an important step has been taken, not only by identifying a new gene causing leukodystrophy, but also by shedding light on the molecular mechanism that allows these gene mutations to cause harm. ""Understanding the mechanisms that affect the biogenesis of RNA polymerase III will now guide our efforts in the development of new diagnostic tools to better predict the evolution and severity of the disease, and new therapeutic tools to help sick children,"" adds Dr. Bernard. ""The ability to diagnose this rare and incurable disease has an enormous impact on families, as it helps them better prepare for what lies ahead,"" explains Dr. Bernard. This is the case for the family of Xavier, 8 years old, who was diagnosed with leukodystrophy in 2013. Since then, his family, who lives in Outaouais, visits Dr. Bernard at the MCH-MUHC every three months.

The Center has the support of the Chilean Economic Development Agency s (Corfo) program to attract international Centers of Excellence, which seeks to position Chile as a hub for research, development and innovation in the region. In this context, Corfo will provide co-financing of USD$7 million, over a period of four years, which added to the USD$14 million from Pfizer, make up a total investment of USD$ 21 million required for the Center s development and operations. ""In Chile, we have very good scientific productivity; however, we have not been able to transform that knowledge into actual products and services that improve both the productivity of industries and the quality of life of people.

In Chile, it is estimated that there are between 1,800 and 2,100 cases a year,"" said Sylvia Varela, President of Pfizer Oncology for Latin America.  At Pfizer, our priority is to develop innovative therapies that improve and prolong the lives of patients. CEPM, which opens its doors today in Santiago, illustrates that commitment in a very definite way. Precision medicine offers one of the best opportunities we have to develop medicines that have a greater positive impact on patients. The work that will be done at CEPM will be on par with the best and most renowned research centers in the world,  she added. ""Analyzing the DNA of a tumor is critical to understanding the disease and consequently adopting more effective and personalized treatment practices that provide the best results according to the patient's genetic information.

Yet, some people with the condition never develop heart disease, while some experience moderate coronary blockages. Others, though, get severe atherosclerosis   multiple blockages and deterioration of coronary arteries characterized by thick, hard, plaque-ridden arterial walls. Researchers at the UNC School of Medicine created a first-of-its-kind animal model to pinpoint two biomarkers that are elevated in the most severe form of coronary disease. The study suggests two new targets   oxidized LDL cholesterol and glycated proteins (i.e., fructosamine or hemoglobin A1c)   that researchers can further investigate and perhaps target through medications to help people with insulin resistance avoid the worst kind of heart disease.  If these correlations were also found in insulin resistant humans, then we would want to do everything we could to treat them because they would be at a very high risk of developing severe cardiovascular disease,  said Timothy Nichols, MD, professor of medicine and pathology and first author of the paper. Interestingly, Nichols and his colleagues did not set out to pinpoint the two key biomarkers. They wanted to create an insulin resistant animal model that mimicked human heart disease. They chose pigs, which are metabolically similar to humans and have hearts very much like human hearts. By feeding the animals a diet high in fat and salt over the course of a year, all the pigs became insulin resistant. That is, their bodies produced a lot of insulin but their cells did not respond to the hormone as well as normal. All the pigs also developed coronary and aortic atherosclerosis. But only about half of the pigs developed the most severe form of the disease. When the researchers checked the pigs for high levels of insulin resistance, they found no correlation with the most severe atherosclerosis. This was a surprising and unexpected finding. David Clemmons, MD, the Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Medicine, professor of biochemistry and biophysics, and senior author of the PLoS Onepaper, knew that the scientific literature suggested a correlation between atherosclerosis and glycated proteins   proteins bonded with sugars in blood. Clemmons and colleagues tested the pigs for high levels of fructosamine and oxidized LDL cholesterol, which are surrogates for high levels of glycated proteins. Sure enough, all the pigs with severe heart disease had elevated levels of fructosamine and oxidized LDL.  Also, this correlation was more common in females,  Clemmons said. Fourteen of the 20 pigs that developed severe atherosclerosis were females. Fourteen of the 17 pigs that did not develop severe atherosclerosis were male.  This surprised me, so I looked in the literature for anything similar.  Clemmons found a study from Finland published in 2005 showing that elevated glycated protein levels were strongly associated with advanced heart disease and increased mortality in women but not in men.  The underlying causes of this correlation are unknown,  Clemmons said.  But now we have a unique animal model that very much mimics what we see in humans. Our model is a good predictor of diet-induced atherosclerosis in females.  A next step could be to study the affected heart tissue to find abnormal biochemical reactions in the cellular pathways involved in glycated proteins and severe coronary disease.  This could lead to potential new treatment approaches or tailored dietary interventions. Clemmons added,  We could also study what s different about these female pigs that make them much more susceptible to severe heart disease, if they have higher levels of glycated proteins.

Catriona Jamieson, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Regenerative Medicine, will lead UC San Diego s effort in the new DPAc team. The UC San Diego-GSK DPAc team will collaborate to discover and develop a new therapeutic compound that inhibits RNA editing, a process cells use to enhance RNA diversity prior to translating genetic information into proteins. Jamieson s group has shown that uncontrolled RNA editing helps cancer stem cells self-renew, making more malignant cells, in chronic myeloid leukemia and other blood cancers. Cancer stem cells can become dormant and evade chemotherapy and then activate again later, causing relapse of leukemia and other cancers and allowing tumors to resist treatment.  The problem with leukemia is that in many cases while we can control the symptoms of disease, we can t completely eradicate it because current therapies don t block cancer stem cell self-renewal. Enhanced RNA editing is like a cancer stem cell engine, and with this collaboration we want to turn that engine off,  said Jamieson, who is also deputy director of the Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center and director of stem cell research at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.  We re very fortunate to have this opportunity to work completely in step with a highly adept, dynamic company to take the RNA editing target idea from design to delivery of a new therapy that may prevent cancer relapse.  GSK launched DPAc as an independent unit in 2010. DPAc s goal is to expedite promising basic research into drug discovery and development, with the potential to bring innovative new treatments to patients. Each selected project works as a joint team, with the academic and GSK scientists sharing data and working toward common goals. Through this arrangement, academic researchers benefit from GSK s capabilities in medicinal chemistry and resources, such as state-of-the-art high-throughput screening technology   the expertise and automated equipment required to quickly and accurately screen millions of potential drug compounds for activity against a selected cellular target.  We are honored to be selected to collaborate with GSK,  said David A. Brenner, MD, vice chancellor for health sciences and dean of UC San Diego School of Medicine.  Paired with GSK s expertise, our collaborative cancer stem cell research infrastructure, bolstered by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, National Cancer Institute and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, places our DPAc team in the best possible position for success.  To be considered for DPAc, academic research proposals must have a clear therapeutic hypothesis, a defined target that can likely be addressed with a drug-like molecule and be led by researchers with deep target and disease expertise, access to model systems and clinical samples to progress the target.  The GSK DPAc program is highly selective and works to identify the best academics with the best targets for partnership,  said Carolyn Buser-Doepner, PhD, vice present and global head of DPAc at GSK.  The UC San Diego collaboration represents several firsts for the DPAc team at GSK   it is our first target in the emerging area of RNA editing and it is our first bench-to-bedside DPAc collaboration with a California university. Furthermore, Dr. Jamieson is an ideal collaborator with deep target and disease expertise, a highly productive preclinical research team with access to clinical samples and the demonstrated ability to translate studies into the clinic.   Academic researchers do science well, but we often need industry partners to help translate those discoveries into new therapeutics that will make a difference to patient lives,  said Ida Deichaite, PhD, director of industry relations at Moores Cancer Center.  This DPAc arrangement is a first for the University of California and will hopefully provide a model for future collaborations.  In addition to a strong collaborative infrastructure, Jamieson credits major support from School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center leadership, including Brenner, Lawrence Goldstein, PhD, director of the Stem Cell Program, Wolfgang Dillmann, MD, chair of the Department of Medicine, and Scott Lippman, MD, director of the Moores Cancer Center.  This is a wonderful example of academia-industry collaboration to accelerate drug development and clinical impact,  said Lippman,  and opens the door for cancer stem cell targeting from a completely new angle   inhibition of aberrant RNA editing.   Groundbreaking research on the basic behavior of stem cells   during human development and in the pathology of disease   has long been one of our strengths at UC San Diego,  said Goldstein, who is also scientific director of the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine and director of the Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center.  Now, those fundamental studies are paying off, as we begin to apply that information in the development of new therapies. ","Published: July 9, 2015"

The solution integrates the RStudio Shiny web application framework and Shiny Server Pro secure, performant application deployment platform to enhance AnalytiXagility s collaborative workspaces.   All too often the translation of healthcare applications into clinical practice fails due to a breakdown in communication between the data scientists that build analytic models, and the clinical practitioners who consume them. Chris Roche, CEO at Aridhia, says:  Within one of our collaborative workspaces, any member of a multidisciplinary team, no matter what their role is, will now be able to easily interact with their data - and each other - without the need to understand advanced analytics.  Aridhia s new  mini-app  rapid prototyping capability embeds RStudio s Shiny reactive data visualisation technology into the company s AnalytiXagility platform, enabling multidisciplinary teams to accelerate the development and deployment of analytically-driven clinical applications.  Data scientists will now be able to rapidly build interactive, visual  apps , bringing their analysis and data to life, and allowing the rest of their multidisciplinary team to interact with data early in the development lifecycle through an incredible visual experience. This means for the first time, highly-targeted, prototype healthcare applications can be developed and validated in a matter of hours, rather than weeks. Roche says:  This morning I asked one of our data scientists to upload a prescribing data set into a workspace. By lunchtime I had several mini-apps in place which I can use to visualise the data in multiple ways at an afternoon meeting. Previously this would have meant several different requests, and a long wait, but now I can interact with the data much more quickly - and without the need for advanced analytic skills.  The healthcare industry is a late and slow adopter of technology, which means that innovations are much slower to disseminate than in other industries. Aridhia believes that a technology-enabled innovation pipeline is critical to facilitating increased collaboration to foster the next generation of patient care innovations, as well as promoting long-term economic growth and healthcare benefits. Combining the power of R, an advanced analytics language, with modern web technologies, such as Shiny, will allow healthcare and research organisations to exploit the information revolution at a rapid rate. This is the first time that the Edinburgh-based company Aridhia and RStudio, the Boston company behind free and open source tools for users of the R programming language, have worked together. The collaboration announcement comes as Aridhia launches the latest version of AnalytiXagility.  We re absolutely delighted to see how Aridhia has integrated Shiny and Shiny Server Pro into its clinical solution,  said Tareef Kawaf, president of RStudio.  The importance of data science in healthcare is gaining greater awareness. Tools that enable the sharing and understanding of the analytical models to the widest possible audience have become more important than ever before.   We enjoy seeing what the community can achieve with R,  continued Kawaf.  The combination of open technologies which Aridhia has embedded into AnalytiXagility, including R and Shiny, mean that it s rapidly becoming a crucial component of multidisciplinary, collaborative clinical research and innovation delivery, which can have a significant impact on patient care. We are truly proud to be part of this effort.  This latest version of Aridhia s platform meets two important objectives   delivering a more comprehensive suite of analytic tools to support multidisciplinary research teams, and adding new information governance features that give stakeholders increased control of their data by logging all activity connected to workspaces. This is Aridhia s first collaboration with RStudio but the latest in a number of pioneering collaborations. Recently, the company announced its partnership with fellow Scottish health tech company Craneware to target the US market, and last year it announced its membership of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. Aridhia s data science platform underpins the world-leading Stratified Medicine Scotland Innovation Centre.","Published: July 9, 2015"

The goal of each research project will be to identify and validate a potential drug candidate for an immunological disease that can be moved into further clinical testing.  Accelerating drug discovery is the goal of every CTI collaboration and this agreement aligns with two of our core therapeutic areas, immunology and rare diseases,  Anthony J. Coyle, svp and CTI s CSO, said in a statement. CTI s network consists of 25 academic institutions and six foundations, as well as four locations: Boston, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco. The network was launched in 2010 to promote academic-industry collaboration designed to bridge the gap between early scientific discovery and its translation into new treatments. Within CTI, Pfizer scientists work alongside academic investigators, sharing target biology and translational medicine expertise. Pfizer provides access to select compound libraries, proprietary screening methods, antibody development technologies, and dedicated resources and support from company experts in drug development and protein sciences. According to CTI, the goal of each collaborative project is to validate a drug candidate that can be advanced into further clinical testing. For JMF, the collaboration with Pfizer is the foundation s first alliance with a biopharmaceutical company.  JMF s expertise in primary immunodeficiency and extensive network of collaborators, combined with Pfizer s impressive research and development capabilities has the potential to identify and advance novel research projects,  JMF co-founder Vicki Modell said in a statement. Modell and her husband Fred Modell established the foundation in 1987 in memory of their son Jeffrey, who died at age 15 from complications of primary immunodeficiency. The foundation s Jeffrey Modell Centers Network includes 600 physicians at 248 academic institutions, in 206 cities in 79 countries on six continents.  By supporting scientific forums, by funding research, by supporting professors and researchers, by providing funds that enable the best and brightest to choose immunology as a life-long career, we hope to have been a critical catalyst for the increased pace of scientific discovery, and we hope that we have influenced and caused positive change for health policy around the world,  the Modells wrote on the foundation s website.","Published: July 9, 2015"

However, the current diagnostic test   the assessment of blood glucose levels   is inefficient and time-consuming, particularly for those in remote settings, the researchers wrote.  Delayed diagnosis is due in part to the use of an algorithm that relies on the assessment of glucose levels and, if the results are equivocal, a follow-up oral glucose tolerance test , the researchers, led by Dr Julia Marley from the University of Western Australia s Rural Clinical School, wrote.  This complicated algorithm can significantly delay informing and educating the patient.  In contrast to glucose testing, assessment of glycated haemoglobin A (HbA1c) requires no fasting. This makes it more suitable for opportunistic testing, and results in fewer missed diagnoses.  Marley and colleagues compared the use of standard glucose testing with the application of a combination of point-of-care (POC) and laboratory HbA1c testing in a 255 Indigenous Australians aged 17 years or more without confirmed diabetes across six primary health care sites in the Kimberley region of WA between September 2011 and November 2013. They found that participants were significantly more likely to receive a definitive test result within 7 days using the HbA1c test, and were more likely to be followed up if an initial result was abnormal. Further, HbA1c tests detected diabetes in more people than did glucose testing.  Eight participants subsequently diagnosed with diabetes (four using the HbA1c test, four with additional oral glucose tolerance tests that would not normally have been requested) were incorrectly classified as normal by the glucose algorithm , the researchers wrote.  No participants with normal HbA1c measurements were subsequently diagnosed with diabetes.  Marley and her colleagues concluded that  the availability of immediate results is likely to further improve diagnosis of diabetes in remote areas and the timeliness of starting treatment .  Our study shows that adopting the Kimberley HbA1c algorithm may simplify the testing process in previously undiagnosed individuals and provide timelier and more accurate diagnosis of diabetes for Aboriginal people and other high-risk remote populations in Australia and elsewhere in the world.

The findings, made in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, shed light on how symmetrical, round cells become  polarized,  or asymmetrical and directional.   Cells have to have a front and a back to migrate,  says Peter Devreotes, Ph.D., professor and director of the Department of Cell Biology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Callipygian shuts off proteins that work at the front edge of cells. By doing so, it helps create the back of a cell, so we named it after the Venus Callipyge.  During cell migration, the front and back of the cell have to coordinate with each other, almost like dance partners. When a chemical  move-this-way  signal reaches a cell, a single protrusion, or pseudopod, begins to form in that direction due to rodlike actin filaments that grow and push the cell s membrane out. The back of the cell is then pulled forward, and the process repeats itself. Both extension of the front and retraction of the back require specific sets of proteins that must localize to the correct sites within the cell for proper migration. To find more proteins involved in cell movement, Kristen Swaney, Ph.D., then a graduate student in Devreotes  laboratory, decided to mark proteins by genetically attaching a fluorescent tag to them. Based on their sequences, two dozen of these were predicted to interact with the well-known front molecule PIP3, suggesting that they too would move to the front of the cell after a migration signal was received. Most of them did, but Callipygian went to the back, says Swaney. It didn t bind to PIP3, either.  We already knew a lot about front proteins and how pseudopods are generated, but the formation of the back of the cell is more of a mystery, so we decided to follow Callipygian s lead,  says Devreotes. One challenge migrating cells face is preventing pseudopods from forming anywhere other than the front of the cell. The researchers found that Callipygian assists in this by accumulating at the back of the cell and preventing actin rods from growing to form a pseudopod.  Callipygian essentially turns off the back of the cell,  says Swaney. The team found that Callipygian uses a positive feedback mechanism to help polarize the cell.  It responds to cell polarity by moving to the back of the cell where it makes changes that create more polarity, which causes more Callipygian to move to the back of the cell,  says Devreotes. The team then studied its structure and figured out which part of the protein makes it move to the back of the cell. They found that adding a key segment from Callipygian to any other protein will make it move to the back of the cell too. According to Swaney, this ability to steer proteins to the  wrong  place in the cell will be a useful tool for studying many other proteins involved in cell polarity. The researchers are continuing to work on understanding the dynamics of  front-and-back proteins  and how they contribute to cell polarity and migration, hoping to shed light on processes such as wound healing and cancer cell metastasis.","Published: July 9, 2015"

The study was led by Peixuan Guo, director of UK's Nanobiotechnology Center and one of the top nanobiotechnology experts in the world. Guo holds a joint appointment at the UK Markey Cancer Center and in the UK College of Pharmacy. ""Efficacy is the key in drug development,  Guo said. ""Inhibiting multisubunit targets works similar to the series-circuit Christmas decorating light chains; one broken bulb turns off the entire lighting system."" By targeting RNA or protein subunits that have multiple sites for inactivation, but that are inextricably linked, this method allows for killing or disabling the RNA or protein without requiring the inhibition of multiple pathways that might be used by the organism to remain active and viable (and thus, multiple drugs are not needed, as well).  Using this method, a single subunit targeting to the target RNA or protein subunits that is unique and assenting for the organism, the organism will be disabled or die and thus, no longer able to cause disease.  One of the vexing problems in the development of drugs is drug resistance,  said Tim Tracy, former Dean of the UK College of Pharmacy and current UK provost.  Dr. Guo's study has identified a new mechanism of efficiently inhibiting biological processes that are critical to the function of the disease-causing organism, such that resistance is minimized or eliminated.

Their ensuing investigation discovered a link between the field of inorganic chemistry and that of the organic chemistry occurring all around us in nature. It was the first evidence of a new cofactor, the nonprotein chemical compound that may be essential to several enzymes. Some enzymes, the biological molecules that accelerate the complex chemical reactions that occur everywhere in our lives, need additional components in order to function. To assist in their biochemical transformations, these enzymes require a  cofactor,  which can either be inorganic, organic, or a combination of both. In the lab, the work of Benoit Desguin, a postdoctoral scholar at MSU, led to the discovery of the previously unknown cofactor, a combination of a nickel ion and an organic compound derived from nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) in an enzyme called lactate racemase. Desquin, working with assistant professor Jian Hu, used sophisticated x-ray technology and methods of mass spectrometry to help make the discovery and confirm the results.  Although similar complexes have been previously synthesized, there was no prior evidence for the existence of pincer cofactors in enzymes,  writes Desguin in a paper published in the current issue of Science Magazine. This new cofactor is an (SCS)Ni(II) pincer complex, where  SCS  means that the nickel ion is coordinated by two sulfur atoms and one carbon atom.  What is really cool is that inorganic chemists have been making compounds similar to what we identified for decades, but this happens to be the first biological example of a pincer complex,  Hausinger said.  Now the fundamental work on pincer compounds has real applications in nature.  The discovery could have important implications for creating and utilizing organic compounds   such as lactic acid   but it also opens up a trove of further questions to explore.  Our next step is to figure out exactly how this complex is made,  Hausinger said.  In addition, we want to fully understand how this  funky cofactor  works and figure out what other reactions make use of it. ","Published: July 9, 2015"

Under the terms of the agreement, Allergan will acquire these rights for an upfront payment of $250 million, $125 million of which is payable upon HSR clearance and $125 million of which is payable in April of 2016. Merck will additionally be entitled to receive potential development and commercial milestone payments and tiered double-digit royalties based on commercialization of the programs. Allergan will be fully responsible for development of the CGRP programs, as well as manufacturing and commercialization upon approval and launch of the products. Allergan said its 2015 earnings-per-share forecast provided on May 11, 2015 is unchanged as a result of the acquisition. Allergan remains committed to de-levering to below 3.5x debt to Adjusted EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016. The agreement gives Allergan rights to two CGRP receptor antagonists:   MK-1602, an oral small molecule antagonist for the acute treatment of migraines.

Rick Gerkin, an assistant research professor with ASU School of Life Sciences, said the data used in a study made public last year does not support this claim. According to Gerkin, this is important because findings from the 2014 study published in the journal Science are already making their way into neuroscience textbooks, misinforming up-and-coming investigators and cutting off potentially productive lines of research that do not adhere to those findings. Researchers from Rockefeller University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute authored that paper. The new paper challenging the findings appears in the journal eLife.  We disagree with several aspects of the 2014 study,  said Gerkin, who co-authored the paper with Jason Castro, a professor with Bates College in Maine.  First, the assertion that humans can discriminate between at least 1 trillion odors is based on a fragile mathematical framework   one that s capable of creating nearly any result with small variations in the data or the experiment design. So the result in question could be tens of orders of magnitude   a factor of one with dozens of zeros after it   larger or smaller than first reported."" Castro added:  We also point out that the conclusion in the 2014 paper relies heavily on untested assumptions about smell perception. And the equation used actually shows that the number of distinguishable smells is fewer than 1 trillion, not more, making the original claim inaccurate, and in fact the exact opposite of what the calculation actually shows.  According to Gerkin, the number of smells humans can discriminate is the kind of fact that could flow naturally from a deeper understanding of olfaction   something we currently lack, but which must be established to better understand olfactory health and diseases of smell.  Scientists can easily compute the number of discriminable colors because they know the organization of color perception,  Gerkin said.  For example, think about the color wheel we learned in elementary school or the red-green-blue color values that make it possible to display color on television. ""For smells, there is no accepted  smell wheel  just yet. To make one, we must first discover the organization of olfactory perception. Only then can a principled calculation be used to determine how many unique smells there really are.  The pair added that only when olfaction is better understood can researchers develop the tools needed to address health issues related to smell disorders, which often have a profound, negative impact on human well-being. Arizona State University   press release Gerkin RC, Castro JB. The number of olfactory stimuli that humans can discriminate is still unknown.  eLife, Published July 7 2015. doi: 10.7554/eLife.08127","Published: July 8, 2015"

Scientists at more than a dozen locations across the United States and Europe analyzed brain MRI scans from 2,028 schizophrenia patients and 2,540 healthy controls, assessed with standardized methods at 15 centers worldwide. The findings, published in Molecular Psychiatry, help further the understanding of the mental disorder. The work was the outcome of the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis project (ENIGMA), from the Schizophrenia Working Group that is co-chaired by Jessica Turner, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgia State University, and Theo van Erp, assistant research professor in psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine.

""Investigators dug into their desk drawers, including unpublished data to participate in these analyses. Everyone performed the same analyses using the same statistical models, and we combined the results. We then identified brain regions that differentiated patients from controls and ranked them according to their effect sizes."" The team found individuals with schizophrenia have smaller volume in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, nucleus accumbens and intracranial space than controls, and larger pallidum and ventricle volumes. The study validates collaborative data analyses can be used across brain phenotypes and disorders, and encourages analysis and data-sharing efforts to further understanding of severe mental illness. The ENIGMA collaborations include working groups for other disorders such as bipolar disorder, attention deficit, major depression, autism and addictions, who are all doing these same analyses. The next step in this research is to compare the effects across disorders, to identify which brain region is the most affected in which disorder, and to determine the effects of age, medication, environment and symptom profiles across these disorders. ""There's the increased possibility, not just because of the massive datasets, but also because of the collaborative brain power being applied here from around the world, that we will find something real and reliable that will change how we think about these disorders and what we can do about them,"" Turner said.

In humid climates such as the U.S. Midwest, evaporation returns more than half of the annual precipitation to the atmosphere, with the remainder available to recharge groundwater and maintain stream flow and lake levels. The study, led by Michigan State Univ. professor of ecosystem ecology and GLBRC scientist Stephen Hamilton, is the first multi-year effort to compare the water use of conventional corn crops to the perennial cropping systems of switchgrass, miscanthus, native grasses, restored prairies and hybrid poplar trees.  When we established the different cropping systems in 2008,  Hamilton said,  we installed soil-water sensors at various depths through the root zone. We ve been continuously monitoring the soil water content ever since.  Hamilton uses the soil-water sensors to measure the rate of evapotranspiration occurring within each cropping system. Evapotranspiration refers to the sum total of water lost while the plant is growing, either from transpiration, which is evaporation through the plant stem itself, or from water evaporated off of the plant s leaves or the ground. By measuring the amount of precipitation that has fallen against actual soil water content, it s possible to quantify the water lost to evapotranspiration while each crop is growing. Hamilton s team reports that the perennial system s evapotranspiration did not differ greatly from corn a finding that contrasts sharply with earlier studies that found particularly high perennial water use in areas with high water tables. Hamilton s study, however, took place in Michigan s temperate humid climate and on the kind of well-drained soil characteristic of marginal farming land.  The message here,  Hamilton said,  is that in many settings, perennials may not use more water. For well-drained soils in the upper Midwest at least, and probably for eastern North America in general, these results most likely apply, and water balance would not be adversely affected.  Though the study has clear implications for cellulosic, or second-generation, biofuel production in the Midwest, Hamilton says it touches more broadly on some of the expected effects of climate change as well. Since the evapotranspiration rates of the study s cropping systems held steady across several years of varying precipitation levels, the study also suggests that crop evapotranspiration rates may not be as sensitive to climate change as is currently assumed.  Our observation that plants use roughly the same amount of water regardless of water availability suggests that a warmer or longer growing season may have a relatively small effect on evapotranspiration and thus could affect landscape water balances less than we previously thought,  Hamilton said.  Other changes in climate-driven aspects of the water cycle, such as intense rain events, less snow or shorter periods of ice cover on lakes, may have a much larger effect on groundwater, stream flow and lake levels.

Now scientists have found a way to locate-with atomic precision-spots within the material where chemical reactions take place, and how these spots shut down. Called active sites, the spots help rip apart and rearrange molecules as they pass through nanometer-sized channels, like an assembly line in a factory. A process called steaming causes these active sites to cluster, effectively shutting down the factory. This knowledge could help devise how to keep the factory running longer, so to speak, and improve catalysts that help produce fuel, biofuel and other chemicals. The team included scientists from the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, petroleum refining technology company UOP LLC and Utrecht University. To make this discovery, they reconstructed the first 3-D atomic map of an industrially relevant zeolite material to track down its key element, aluminum.Pacific Northwest National Laboratory materials scientist Danny Perea looks into an atom probe, which he and an international team of scientists used to locate aluminum clusters responsible for the shutdown of catalytic activity in zeolites, a material used by industry to produce fuel and other chemicals. Courtesy of PNNL. When things get steamy, structure changes Zeolites are minerals made up of aluminum, silicon and oxygen atoms arranged in a three-dimensional crystalline structure. Though they look like white powder to the naked eye, zeolites have a sponge-like network of molecule-size pores. Aluminum atoms along these pores act like workers on an assembly line-they create active sites that give zeolites their catalytic properties. Industry uses about a dozen synthetic zeolites as catalysts to process petroleum and chemicals. One major conversion process, called fluid catalytic cracking, depends on zeolites to produce the majority of the world's gasoline. To awaken active sites within zeolites, industry pretreats the material with heat and water, a process called steaming. But too much steaming somehow switches the sites off. Changing the conditions of steaming could extend the catalyst's life, thus producing fuel more efficiently. Scientists have long suspected that steaming causes aluminum to move around within the material, thus changing its properties. But until now aluminum has evaded detailed analysis. Strip away the atoms Most studies of zeolite structure rely on electron microscopy, which can't easily distinguish aluminum from silicon because of their similar masses. Worse, the instrument's intense electron beam tends to damage the material, changing its inherent structure before it's seen. Instead, the team of scientists turned to a characterization technique that had never before been successfully applied to zeolites. Called atom probe tomography, it works by zapping a sample with a pulsing laser, providing just enough energy to knock off one atom at a time. Time-of-flight mass spectrometers analyze each atom-at a rate of about 1,000 atoms per second. Unlike an electron microscope, this technique can distinguish aluminum from silicon. Though atom probe tomography has been around for 50 years, it was originally designed to look at conductive materials, such as metals. Less conductive zeolites presented a problem. PNNL materials scientist Danny Perea and his colleagues overcame this hurdle by adapting a Local Electrode Atom Probe at EMSL, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a DOE Office of Science User Facility accessible to scientists around the world. Most attempts to image the material ended prematurely, when electromagnetic forces within the instrument vaporized the entire sample. The key to success was to find the right conditions to prepare a sample and then to coat it with a layer of metal to help provide conductivity and strength to withstand analysis. After hours of blasting tens-of-millions of atoms, the scientists could reconstruct an atomic map of a sample about a thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair. These maps hold clues as to why the catalyst fails. A place to cluster The images confirmed what scientists have long suspected: Steaming causes aluminum atoms to cluster. Like workers crowded around one spot on the assembly line, this clustering effectively shuts down the catalytic factory. The scientists even pinpointed the place where aluminum likes to cluster. Zeolite crystals often grow in overlapping sub-units, forming something like a 3-D Venn diagram. Scientists call the edge between two sub-units a grain boundary, and that's where the aluminum clustered. The scientists suspect that open space along grain boundaries attracted the aluminum. With the guidance of these atomic maps, industry could one day modify how it steams zeolites to produce a more efficient, longer lasting catalyst. The research team will next examine other industrially important zeolites at different stages of steaming to provide a more detailed map of this transformation.","Published: July 8, 2015"

To create the egg, a precursor cell called an oocyte undergoes meiosis: a specialised form of cell division in which half the chromosomes are separated away leaving exactly the right number of chromosomes in the egg. Meiosis in human oocytes is highly error-prone, which can cause the egg to have the wrong number of chromosomes. This is known as aneuploidy and is the leading cause of pregnancy loss and genetic disorders such as Down s syndrome. Despite the significance of this process, little is known about the genes involved. Melina Schuh s group, in the LMB s Cell Biology Division, has now developed screening techniques for meiotic genes, leading to the discovery of a number of genes that are essential for meiosis in mammals. Finding the genes that are responsible for controlling accurate progression through meiosis is hugely important for understanding why human eggs so often contain errors. RNA interference (RNAi) is a method for systematically blocking the production of specific proteins, so that scientists can find out the role of each one. However, oocytes contain lots of stored proteins, so this interference would need to be started from a very early developmental stage to completely block each protein. Sybille Pfender, Vitaliy Kuznetsov and Micha  Pasternak in Melina s group developed a screen where they microinjected short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into very small follicle-enclosed mouse oocytes and grew the follicles in vitro, blocking the protein expression while they grew. They waited until the oocytes had reached their full size before imaging them live with confocal microscopes to study the function of targeted genes. This is the first RNAi screen for meiotic genes in mammals and its development has allowed Melina s group to analyse the function of nearly 800 genes, identifying many new genes involved in mammalian meiosis. The screening also created huge amounts of data showing how mammalian chromosomal defects arise. Many couples find it difficult to conceive and rely on in vitro fertilisation to achieve their dreams of having a family. This screening technology will help to develop methods that could improve fertility treatments in the long term.","Published: July 8, 2015"

For the study researchers Brian Laidlaw, Dr. Joseph Craft, and Dr. Susan M. Kaech and co-authors observed immune responses to infection in mouse models. They found that a chemical signal known as IL-10, which is secreted by regulatory T cells, is important for the development of long-term immunity. IL-10 is particularly important for keeping inflammation in check during the resolution phase of infection. By reducing inflammation during this phase, IL-10 enabled long-term memory cells   CD8+ T cells   to mature and develop their capacity to protect against future infection. The finding may hold the key to more effective vaccines.  A critical problem with many vaccines is that they do not elicit a robust and protective T cell response,  said Laidlaw. The study sheds light on another pathway for enhancing the body s protective response.  By understanding this process, during each phase of the immune response, we hope to be able to mirror these steps in a vaccine approach,  he said.","Published: July 8, 2015"

The study, led by Jes s M. Cort s of BioCruces, reveals the strong dependence existing between structural connectivity and the functional connectivity networks, opening up new avenues for studying Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, epilepsy and head injuries. The brain is a highly complex, dynamic system. It is made up of gray and white matter. The gray matter contains the neurons which are responsible for processing the information received from the sensory area and other parts of the brain. The white matter makes use of fibers and is responsible for connecting the various regions of gray matter of the brain so that they can communicate with each other efficiently and collaborate in complex, cognitive tasks (this map of fibers is like the brain's highways). The functional interaction between the various regions of the brain is essential for it to function properly: it is reckoned that 20% of the energy consumed by a person is used by the brain to establish and maintain these connections. Many studies have been carried out until now to understand how the brain functions and how it is organized structurally, but we still have much more to learn. A new study, led by Jes s M. Cort s, an Ikerbasque lecturer at the Biocruces Institute for Healthcare Research and an academic collaborator in the Department of Cell Biology and Histology of the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country, has shed some light on this problem. The work has been published in the journal Scientific Reports and its lead author is Ibai D ez, a telecommunications engineer also attached to Biocruces. In actual fact, the study combines techniques at the cutting edge of three disciplines: neuroscience, image processing and network theory. In particular, the brain's structural (fibers) and functional data (the brain's functional activity) have been merged on a large scale to analyze how the brain is organized.  This analysis has resulted in the ""partitioning"" of the brain into an atlas that follows a common functional and structural pattern. This is the first time that a brain atlas has been produced by combining structural and functional data; until now, the atlases used were purely structural ones (anatomical ones) or purely functional ones. Thanks to this new partition of the brain, the heavy dependence that exists between structural connectivity and the functional connectivity networks has been revealed for the first time. The atlas is robust and consistent across different individuals (it has been validated using data from other subjects and in different magnetic resonance imaging equipment). Many neurological disorders affect the central nervous system. A considerable number are of a structural origin, such as head injuries or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzhiemer's or Parkinson's (which originate as a result of a significant loss of fibers). Others may have a functional origin, such as a simple headache, a migraine or even an epileptic fit. Structural damage is known to lead to a functional alteration (the loss of fibers in Alzheimer's causes memory loss, etc.) or the other way round (there are people who display neuronal loss in specific zones after numerous epileptic fits). So the structure-function relationship is closely related as alterations in one of them affect the other. The new atlas has been produced using data from healthy subjects. Right now, alterations in each of these regions caused by aging or a moderate to severe head injury are being studied. So the study of the alterations in the different regions of the atlas may henceforth open up alternative avenues for understanding a range of disorders.

How cancer stem cells retain this property while the bulk of a tumor's cells do not remains largely unknown. Using human tumor samples and mouse models, researchers at University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center discovered that cancer stem cell properties are determined by epigenetic changes -- chemical modifications cells use to control which genes are turned on or off. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that an enzyme known as Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) turns off genes required to maintain cancer stem cell properties in glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. This epigenetic activity helps explain how glioblastoma can resist treatment. What's more, drugs that modify LSD1 levels could provide a new approach to treating glioblastoma. The researchers first noticed that genetically identical glioblastoma cells isolated from patients differed in their tumorigenicity, or capacity to form tumors, when transplanted to mouse models. This observation suggested that epigenetics, rather than genetics (DNA sequence), determines tumorigenicity in glioblastoma cancer stem cells. ""One of the most striking findings in our study is that there are dynamic and reversible transitions between tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic states in glioblastoma that are determined by epigenetic regulation,"" said senior author Clark Chen, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurosurgery and vice-chair of research and academic development at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Probing further, Chen's team discovered that the epigenetic factor determining whether or not glioblastoma cells can proliferate indefinitely as cancer stem cells is their relative abundance of LSD1. LSD1 removes chemical tags known as methyl groups from DNA, turning off a number of genes required for maintaining cancer stem cell properties, including MYC, SOX2, OLIG2 and POU3F2. ""This plasticity represents a mechanism by which glioblastoma develops resistance to therapy,"" Chen said. ""For instance, glioblastomas can escape the killing effects of a drug targeting MYC by simply shutting it off epigenetically and turning it on after the drug is no longer present. Ultimately, strategies addressing this dynamic interplay will be needed for effective glioblastoma therapy."" Chen and one of the study's first authors, Jie Li, PhD, note that the epigenetic changes driving glioblastoma are similar to those that take place during normal human development. ""Though most cells in our bodies contain identical DNA sequences, epigenetic changes help make a liver cell different from a brain cell,"" said Li, an assistant project scientist in Chen's lab. ""Our results indicate that the same programming processes determine whether a cancer cell can grow indefinitely or not.""

Under the two approaches, immune cells from outside the brain were found to travel in greater numbers through the blood into the brain. The study showed measurable benefits in mice, an encouraging step toward further testing of these potentially powerful strategies in human trials. Researchers point out that the brain's own immune cells are critical for its healthy function. During the progression of Alzheimer's disease, these cells are found to be defective. In this study, the researchers discovered that immune cells infiltrating the brain from the blood effectively resisted various abnormalities associated with the condition. ""These cells appear to work in the brain in several ways to counter the negative effects associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, PhD, assistant professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai, and the senior author of the article published in Brain. ""The increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease and the lack of any effective therapy make it imperative to explore new strategies, especially those that can target multiple abnormalities in such a complicated disease,"" Koronyo-Hamaoui added. In Alzheimer's disease, a protein fragment known as amyloid-beta builds up at the synapses of neurons -- the point where neuron-to-neuron communication occurs. As a result, synapses are lost and cognitive function becomes severely impaired. Immune cells in the brain that are exposed to increasing concentrations of the toxic protein fragment deteriorate and lose their ability to attack and clear away the buildup. Over time, these cells themselves go awry, contributing to harmful inflammation and becoming toxic to the neurons. During the course of the disease, cells that support the brain's structure and function also fail at the cellular and molecular levels, steadily impairing memory and learning functions. In efforts to boost an effective immune response, the Cedars-Sinai scientists have devised ways to ""recruit"" white blood cells known as monocytes from bone marrow to attack the protein fragments and preserve the synapses. The researchers evaluated two such methods and their therapeutic potential. In one, they extracted a specific type of monocytes from the bone marrow of healthy young mice and injected the cells into the tail veins of sick mice once a month. A second group of sick mice received weekly under-the-skin injections of glatiramer acetate, an FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; the drug has been shown to foster the migration of white blood cells from the bloodstream to the brain. A third group received both treatments. All three groups experienced a substantial decrease in Alzheimer's-like pathology and symptoms. The varied approaches were effective in ""recruiting"" protective monocytes to ""lesion sites"" in the brain, removing protein fragments and reducing harmful inflammation through the secretion of chemicals that regulate immunity at the molecular level, said Koronyo-Hamaoui, the head of Cedars-Sinai's neuroimmunology laboratory at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute and a faculty member in the Department of Neurosurgery and Department of Biomedical Sciences. In this study, glatiramer acetate was further found to profoundly affect monocytes' function, she added. ""This study provides the evidence that a subgroup of unmodified monocytes, extracted from the bone marrow of healthy mouse donors and grafted into the bloodstream, can migrate into the brains of sick mice, directly clear abnormal protein accumulation and preserve cognitive function,"" said Yosef Koronyo, the article's first author and a research associate in the Department of Neurosurgery. Koronyo added that the study gives unprecedented details about monocyte numbers migrating into brain lesion sites and the compounds they secrete, and shows that the body's natural monocytes can have direct effects on the integrity of synapses.

But just why the immune system begins its misdirected assault has remained a mystery. Now, researchers at Temple University School of Medicine (TUSM) have shown that bacterial communities that form biofilms play a role in the development of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus -- a discovery that may provide important clues about several autoimmune ailments. A team led by TUSM researchers  agla T kel, PhD, and Stefania Gallucci, MD, show how bacterial biofilms found in the gut can provoke the onset of lupus in lupus-prone mice and is published in the journal Immunity. ""This work stresses the importance of considering infections as a possible trigger for lupus,"" Dr. Gallucci said. ""Very little was known about how biofilms interact with the immune system because most of the research has been looking at how biofilms protect bacteria, how they make bacteria resistant to antimicrobials such as antibiotics, but almost nothing was known about what biofilms do to the immune response,"" she said. Biofilm is a densely packed bacterial community that excretes proteins and other substances. Those substances form a matrix that protects the bacteria from antimicrobials, the immune system, and other stressors. Biofilms can occur in our guts, among the bacteria that help us digest. They exist as dental plaque, or arise in urinary tract infections. They also can find a home on human-made surfaces such as intravenous catheters. Central to the lupus story is a biofilm protein deposit called an amyloid. In the common gut bacteria E. coli, as well as the bacteria often responsible for severe gastrointestinal distress that accompanies food poisoning, Salmonella Typhimurium, amyloids are called curli because of their curly fiber-like appearance. Also part of the biofilm is DNA excreted by bacteria. The Temple team discovered that when curli amyloids and DNA meet, they form remarkably durable bonds in the biofilm. When the researchers attempted to separate the DNA from these bonds using a variety of enzymes as well as chemicals, the curli wouldn't let go. Curli-DNA complexes speed up the creation of the biofilm, the researchers learned. And the Temple researchers found it is also in this composite of curli-plus-DNA that autoimmune trouble appears to arise. It's long been known that infection is associated with lupus flares -- a flare in lupus is when symptoms worsen. Indeed, infections play a role in between 20 percent and 55 percent of lupus patient mortality. Up to 23 percent of hospitalizations in lupus patients are due to infectious disease complications. Further, the bacteria Salmonella are more aggressive in lupus patients, with the ability to create potentially lethal complications. The new research shows that the complexes formed from curli amyloid and DNA in the biofilms of both Salmonella and E. coli give rise to not only inflammation, but the self-attacking antibodies of lupus. To demonstrate the role of biofilms in immune response, the researchers wanted to see how the sentinels of the immune system, called dendritic cells, reacted to a biofilm. The dendritic cells sent ""tendrils"" into the biofilm and ate up part of it to signal other molecules. Further, they produced large amounts of chemicals called proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are important in inciting the immune system to act. Among the cytokines was Type-1 interferon, known to be associated with lupus. ""I was super excited when I saw how activated the dendritic cells were on the biofilm "" Dr. Gallucci said. The levels of cytokines released when dendritic cells were exposed to curli-DNA complexes actually exceeded the most robust response known previously -- the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To test if the immune response seen in the laboratory would be enough to induce autoimmunity and the attack on self that occurs in lupus, the researchers used mice that are prone to develop autoimmune disease. As is the case with many diseases, lupus is the result of a genetic propensity that lies dormant in the absence of an environmental trigger. The researchers wanted to see if the curli-DNA complexes could provide that trigger. They injected susceptible mice with the amyloid-DNA composites or a placebo. Within two weeks, the researchers found the kind of antibodies that attack ""self,"" known as autoantibodies. The autoantibodies, which target double-stranded DNA, are a diagnostic hallmark of lupus. The response was remarkably fast. It normally takes mice four to five months to develop autoantibodies. Another strain of mice that do not develop lupus spontaneously but are genetically predisposed to autoimmunity also reacted to the curli-DNA composites with rapid production of autoantibodies. A third strain of mice with no propensity for any autoimmune disease, developed autoantibodies within two weeks of injection, but at lower levels than in the mice with a propensity toward lupus. All mice developed the autoantibodies whether the curli-DNA composites came from Salmonella or from the kind of E. coli that's found in a healthy digestive system. In fact, three of the four bacterial families that contain curli genes are found in the gut: Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes, suggesting a possible source of vulnerability in susceptible patients. ""How that happens, I think that will be the next level of our project,"" Dr. Gallucci said. The research team is already looking at mouse models to see what may lead to the escape of curli-DNA complexes from the gut. Further, the team is collaborating with rheumatologist Dr. Roberto Caricchio, Director of the Temple Lupus Clinic, to see if the patients show signs of exposure to the curli-DNA complexes. ""The next step is to explore the mechanism of how these composites are stimulating autoimmunity,"" Dr. T kel said. ""The beneficial bacteria found in our guts can cause problems when they cross the intestinal barrier and reach to places they shouldn't be. Thus, besides infectious bacteria, a leaky gut could cause many problems. We are now starting to understand how the bacteria in our gut may trigger complex human diseases including lupus. So it's critical for us to understand the biology of the bacterial communities and their interactions with the immune system."" The research may offer clues to diseases involving amyloids, Dr. T kel said. For instance, amyloid plaques in the brain are a signature of Alzheimer's disease. Type-2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease also feature amyloids. ""Right now, we can only speculate,"" she said. ""Some reports suggested that antibiotic treatment may be changing the course of Alzheimer's disease. Antibiotics are thought, in some cases, to slow the mental decline suggesting that bacterial infections, or a bacterial component, may be contributing to the disease. That could be a link, but for the moment, it's only speculation."" Understanding how biofilms trigger autoimmunity may ultimately lead to changes in patient treatment, Dr. Gallucci said. ""So understanding how the biofilms affect flares could lead to a different treatment approach. Now, they give immune suppressive drugs.

And a new study in an extended family of monkeys provides important insights into how the risk of developing anxiety and depression is passed from parents to children. The study from the Department of Psychiatry and the Health Emotions Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison shows how an over-active brain circuit involving three brain areas inherited from generation to generation may set the stage for developing anxiety and depressive disorders. The study is published online in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It shows that elevated activity in this prefrontal- limbic -midbrain circuit is likely involved in mediating the in-born risk for extreme anxiety, anxious temperament that can be observed in early childhood. ""Over-activity of these three brain regions are inherited brain alterations that are directly linked to the later life risk to develop anxiety and depression,'' says senior author Dr. Ned Kalin, chair of psychiatry at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. ""This is a big step in understanding the neural underpinnings of inherited anxiety and begins to give us more selective targets for treatment."" Previous research by Kalin's group has shown that anxious temperament is inherited, and explained the brain circuits involved. About half of children who show extreme anxiety go on to develop stress-related psychiatric disorders later in life. Monkeys, like humans, can be temperamentally anxious and pass their anxiety-related genes on to the next generation. By studying nearly 600 young rhesus monkeys from a large multi-generational family, Drs. Andrew Fox, Kalin, and colleagues found that about 35 percent of variation in anxiety-like tendencies is explained by family history. To understand which brain regions are responsible for passing anxiety from generation to generation, the authors measured anxiety-related behavior with high-resolution functional and structural brain imaging. They exposed the young monkeys to a mildly threatening situation that a child would also encounter, exposure to a stranger who does not make eye contact with the monkey. During this encounter, they used imaging methods commonly used in humans (positron emission tomography, PET) to identify brain regions in which increased metabolism predicted each individual's level of anxiety. By closely examining how individual differences in brain function and anxiety-related behavior fall through the family tree, the authors identified brain systems responsible for the parent-to-child transmission of anxiety-related behavior. Using this ""genetic correlation"" approach, the authors found the neural circuit where metabolism and an early-life anxious temperament are likely to share the same genetic basis. Interestingly, the brain circuit that was genetically correlated with individual differences in early-life anxiety involved three survival-related brain regions. These regions were located in the brain stem, the most primitive part of the brain; the amygdala, the limbic brain fear center; and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for higher-level reasoning and is fully developed only in humans and their primate cousins. ""Basically, we think that to a certain extent, anxiety can provide an evolutionary advantage because it helps an individual recognize and avoid danger, but when the circuits are over-active, it becomes a problem and can result in anxiety and depressive disorders,"" Kalin explains. Surprisingly, these studies found that it was the function of these brain structures -- and not their size -- that was responsible for the genetic transfer of an anxious temperament. Although the search for the genetic underpinnings of anxiety have thus far been elusive, this research helps explain how genes might affect brain function and lead to extreme childhood anxiety, which greatly increases the risk to develop anxiety and depressive disorders. ""Now that we know where to look, we can develop a better understanding of the molecular alterations that give rise to anxiety-related brain function,'' Kalin says.

The new method allows researchers to map critical chemical tags called phosphates that bond to amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) in the final stages of creating a protein.Salk scientists developed antibodies that tag essential chemicals involved in protein action. In this dividing cell, the new antibody (green) marks discrete areas of a critical but elusive chemical reaction that happens when cells divide (DNA in blue and tubulin, a protein needed for cell division, in red). When a cell produces a protein, molecular synthetic machinery first pieces together the amino acids into a long strand that bends and folds as it lengthens. Enzymes then gather around the structure to make final tweaks trimming the protein or adding chemical tags. Among these last modifications is phosphorylation or addition of phosphate of individual amino acids to change the protein s function. Until now, pinpointing exactly where (and why) all those phosphates are added has been tricky.  We know that 9 out of the 20 amino acids can be phosphorylated, but we know very little about most of them because they re so hard to study,  says Tony Hunter, American Cancer Society Professor, holder of the Dulbecco Chair in the Salk s Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory and senior author of the new paper. When phosphate is added to three particular amino acids serine, threonine and tyrosine it forms a strong chemical bond. Researchers can easily identify the location of these phosphates. But when the other six amino acids are phosphorylated, the phosphate is only loosely attached to each amino acid, causing problems for researchers trying to glean what happens in these cases. One of these amino acids, called histidine (or phosphohistidine once a phosphate is added), has been particularly tough to study.  With those strong phosphorylation events, you can label cells, isolate proteins and analyze the proteins in various ways to find out where the phosphates are,  says Hunter.  You can t do that with phosphohistidine because it s so unstable it falls apart as you re trying to isolate the proteins.  Hunter and his collaborators realized that to study this unstable interaction, they would have to use a trick to make a stronger bond between phosphate and histidine. So they used a special kind of modified phosphate, called phosphonate, engineered to bind more tightly to either of the two spots on a histidine amino acid where phosphate can be added. Then, they developed antibodies that specifically recognize these stable phosphohistidine analogues, but also detect authentic phosphohistidine in proteins. To test these new tools, the team added their phosphohistidine antibodies to a collection of different mammalian cells grown on slides and observed where in the cell the antibodies bound, which indicates parts of cells that have high levels of proteins with phosphohistidines.  The thing that surprised us most is that when we stained the cells with the new antibodies, we saw discrete areas within the cells that had high levels of histidine phosphorylation, particularly when they were undergoing mitosis, the stage at which cells divide into two daughter cells,  says Hunter. They don t yet know exactly why that is, but plan to continue to explore these results as well as detect the phosphorylation of other amino acids. The team expects these antibody tools to be useful to other labs aiming to determine whether proteins of interest have any phosphohistidines. The new method is  fairly easy for any lab to use,  Hunter says.  It doesn t require a special instrument or anything, so I think it may be fairly quickly adopted. ","Published: July 7, 2015"

""One day, we hope to use such measures to identify and treat people years before memory loss and other cognitive problems become apparent."" The study focused on data gathered over 10 years and involved 169 cognitively normal research participants ages 45 to 75 when they entered the study. Each participant received a complete clinical, cognitive imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis every three years, with a minimum of two evaluations. At the participants' initial assessments, researchers divided them into three age groups: early-middle age (45-54); mid-middle age (55- 64); and late-middle age (65-74). Among the biomarkers evaluated in the new study were: Amyloid beta 42, a protein that is the principal ingredient of Alzheimer's plaques; Tau, a structural component of brain cells that increases in the cerebrospinal fluid as Alzheimer's disease damages brain cells; YKL-40, a newly recognized protein that is indicative of inflammation and is produced by brain cells; and The presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, as seen via amyloid PET scans. The scientists found that drops in amyloid beta 42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid among cognitively normal participants ages 45-54 are linked to the appearance of plaques in brain scans years later. The researchers also found that tau and other biomarkers of brain-cell injury increase sharply in some individuals as they reach their mid-50s to mid-70s, and YKL-40 rises throughout the age groups focused on in the study. Previous research has shown that all of these biomarkers may be affected by Alzheimer's disease, but this is the first large data set to show that the biomarkers change over time in middle-aged individuals. All of these changes were more pronounced in participants who carried a form of a gene that significantly increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The gene is known as APOE, and scientists have known that people with two copies of a particular version of this gene have up to 10 times the risk of developing Alzheimer's as those with other versions of the gene. The data came from the ongoing Adult-Children Study at the university's Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Scientists have been following participants with and without a family history of the disease, with the aim of identifying Alzheimer's biomarkers most closely associated with the development of full-blown disease years later. ""Alzheimer's is a long-term process, and that means we have to observe people for a long time to catch glimpses of it in action,"" Fagan said.","Published: July 7, 2015"

Although they were all born within months of each other, these 38-year-olds appear to be aging at different rates.  Indeed they are, say the leaders of a large long-term human health study in New Zealand that has sought clues to the aging process in young adults. A team from the U.S., UK, Israel and New Zealand introduces a panel of 18 biological measures that may be combined to determine whether people are aging faster or slower than their peers.  The data comes from the Dunedin Study, a landmark longitudinal study that has tracked more than a thousand people born in 1972-73 in the same town from birth to the present. Health measures like blood pressure and liver function have been taken regularly, along with interviews and other assessments.  We set out to measure aging in these relatively young people,  said Dan Belsky, an assistant professor of geriatrics at Duke.  Most studies of aging look at seniors, but if we want to be able to prevent age-related disease, we re going to have to start studying aging in young people.  Belsky said the progress of aging shows in human organs just as it does in eyes, joints and hair, but sooner. So as part of their regular reassessment of the study population at age 38 in 2011, the team measured the functions of kidneys, liver, lungs, metabolic and immune systems. They also measured HDL cholesterol, cardiorespiratory fitness, lung function and the length of the telomeres -- protective caps at the end of chromosomes that have been found to shorten with age. The study also measures dental health and the condition of the tiny blood vessels at the back of the eyes, which are a proxy for the brain s blood vessels.  Based on a subset of these biomarkers, the research team set a  biological age  for each participant, which ranged from under 30 to nearly 60 in the 38-year-olds.  The researchers then went back into the archival data for each subject and looked at 18 biomarkers that were measured when the participants were age 26, and again when they were 32 and 38. From this, they drew a slope for each variable, and then the 18 slopes were added for each study subject to determine that individual s pace of aging.  Most participants clustered around an aging rate of one year per year, but others were found to be aging as fast as three years per chronological year. Many were aging at zero years per year, in effect staying younger than their age.  As the team expected, those who were biologically older at age 38 also appeared to have been aging at a faster pace. A biological age of 40, for example, meant that person was aging at a rate of 1.2 years per year over the 12 years the study examined.  This paper reports on 954 of the original 1,037 Dunedin study participants. Thirty of them had died by age 38: 12 by illnesses such as cancer and congenital defects, 10 by accidents and eight by suicide or drug overdose. Another 26 did not take part in the study at age 38. Twenty-seven participants had insufficient data to be included.  Most people think of the aging process as something that happens late in life, Belsky said, but signs of aging were already apparent in these tests over the 12 years of young adulthood: from 26 to 38.  Study members who appeared to be more advanced in biological aging also scored worse on tests typically given to people over 60, including tests of balance and coordination and solving unfamiliar problems. The biologically older individuals also reported having more difficulties with physical functioning than their peers, such as walking up stairs.  As an added measure, the researchers asked Duke University undergraduate students to assess facial photos of the study participants taken at age 38 and rate how young or old they appeared. Again, the participants who were biologically older on the inside also appeared older to the college students. The aging process isn t all genetic. Studies of twins have found that only about 20 percent of aging can be attributed to genes, Belsky said.  There s a great deal of environmental influence,  he said.  That gives us some hope that medicine might be able to slow aging and give people more healthy active years,  said Terrie Moffitt, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke.  This paper s methods are merely a proof of concept, Belsky said, to show that it s possible to see an aging trajectory by combining multiple measures.   The time is right for this kind of multi-factorial way of measuring the aging process,  he said, but the measures and methods need refinement to be  better, faster and cheaper.  The ultimate goal, of course, is to be able to intervene in the aging process itself, rather than addressing killers like heart disease or cancer in isolation, Belsky said.   As we get older, our risk grows for all kinds of different diseases,  he said.  To prevent multiple diseases simultaneously, aging itself has to be the target. Otherwise, it s a game of whack-a-mole.

""P53 was already known to monitor many things, like DNA damage and having the wrong number of chromosomes, that make division dangerous for cells,"" says Andrew Holland, Ph.D., an assistant professor of molecular biology and genetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We've discovered one more item on its checklist: centriole number."" Cells normally have two centrioles that work together as a unit to anchor and organize microtubules, the molecular rods that form the cell's backbone. As a cell prepares for division, one new centriole forms alongside each existing centriole. Then, each pair goes to opposite sides of the cell. Before dividing, pairs of identical chromosomes line up in the middle of the elongated cell, and the microtubules, emanating out from the centrioles on either side, help pull the chromosomes in opposite directions so that each new cell receives one member of each chromosome pair. ""If cells don't segregate their chromosomes properly, there can be dire consequences,"" says Bramwell Lambrus, a graduate student in Dr. Holland's laboratory. ""Down syndrome, for example, results from an embryo inheriting an extra copy of chromosome 21. What's fascinating is that the cells that divide to create a woman's egg cells do not have centrioles, so we know that they're not absolutely necessary but very helpful."" To better understand the role of centrioles in cell division, the team needed to see how cells behaved without them. However, fully wiping out a cell's centrioles for long enough to study the results posed a serious challenge because, when a cell senses its centrioles are gone, it makes new ones from scratch. To overcome this hurdle, Dr. Holland's team went after the protein Plk4, which is required for centriole formation. Instead of permanently deleting the Plk4 gene from the cells, they used a trick from plant biology to toggle its presence in the cells, one that had never before been applied to an animal cell's proteins. Working with human retina cells, the researchers tweaked Plk4 so that it would be sent to cellular trash cans whenever they gave the cells the plant hormone auxin. As long as it was present, auxin prevented new centrioles from forming, so each cell division halved the number of centrioles per cell. By the fourth cell division, most of the cells had no centrioles, and none of them divided again. But even after auxin was removed and Plk4 was restored, the cells refused to divide or make more centrioles. ""The cells were permanently stuck,"" explains Dr. Holland. ""It was a Catch-22. They couldn't divide again without making new centrioles, but they couldn't make new centrioles without starting the process of division. It was clear that something was telling the cells not to divide."" After testing a few different hypotheses to explain why the cells were stuck, the team turned to p53, a protein known for preventing cell division when things aren't right. When they halted p53 production in cells with no centrioles, they began to divide again. As expected, the newly formed cells had many chromosome abnormalities. In a final experiment, the scientists restored Plk4 to cells lacking both centrioles and p53 to see if the cells would make new centrioles. Since p53 wasn't there to prevent their division, the return of Plk4 was all that was necessary for the cells to start centriole formation again from scratch. ""Since centriole formation without an existing centriole template only occurs when cells lack all of their centrioles, it's a rare occurrence, and it was exciting to watch it happen under the microscope,"" notes Lambrus. The team plans to continue analyzing the formation of new centrioles, and how p53 detects centrioles and prevents cells from dividing without them.  Ninety percent of human tumors have chromosome abnormalities, and we know that many of these are made possible by mutations in p53,"" explains Dr. Holland. ""If centrioles aren't there to aid proper chromosome segregation, p53 acts as backup to prevent making abnormal cells. It's an important safeguard that we'd like to understand more.""","Published: July 7, 2015"

This work suggests that bioprinting at ambient temperatures is a viable route to the production of materials for bone repair which would allow the inclusion of cells and proteins capable of accelerating the healing of large fractures.  Bioprinting is a hot research area in tissue engineering,  explains Dr Jing Yang, of the University of Nottingham.  However it usually requires a printing environment that isn t compatible with living cells   and those materials that are compatible with living cells usually don t have sufficient mechanical properties for certain applications.   Initially we re targeting the clinical application of this material as injectable bone defect filler,  continues Dr Yang,  but we ve postulated that its properties would make it highly suitable for use as a scaffold to reconstruct larger shapes, which could help with more complicated reconstructions   such as nasal reconstruction.  Typically, bioprinting techniques involve high temperature processes, or the application of ultraviolet light or organic solvents, all of which prevent the incorporation of cells and therapeutic biomolecules during the fabrication process. This technique involved blending poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyethylene glycol with carrier fluids at room temperature to form a micro-particulate extrudable paste that can be formed to desired shapes. These pastes were incubated at 37  C to form porous solid constructs. The next steps of the process will be to apply this process in a clinical application.","Published: July 7, 2015"

Malaria is caused by a parasite that lives inside an infected mosquito and is transferred into the human through a bite. Once inside the body, parasites use a complex process to enter red blood cells and survive within them. By identifying one of the key proteins needed for the parasite to survive in the red blood cells, the team have prevented the protein from working, thus killing the parasite.  The discovery could be the first step in developing a new drug to treat malaria. The scientists   funded by the MRC and the Wellcome Trust   used state-of the-art methods to dissect the biochemical pathways involved in keeping the malaria parasite alive. This included an approach called chemical genetics where synthetic chemicals are used in combination with introducing genetic changes to the DNA of the parasite.  The researchers found that one protein kinase, (PfPKG) plays a central role in various pathways that allow the parasite to survive in the blood. Understanding the pathways the parasite uses means that future drugs could be precisely designed to kill the parasite but with limited toxicity, making them safe enough to be used by children and pregnant women.  Professor Andrew Tobin from the MRC Toxicology Unit said:  This is a real breakthrough in our understanding of how malaria survives in the blood stream and invades red blood cells. We ve revealed a process that allows this to happen and if it can be targeted by drugs we could see something that stops malaria in its tracks without causing toxic side-effects.  Professor David Baker from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said:  It is a great advantage in drug discovery research if you know the identity of the molecular target of a particular drug and the consequences of blocking its function. It helps in designing the most effective combination treatments and also helps to avoid drug resistance which is a major problem in the control of malaria worldwide.  According to the World Health Organization malaria currently infects more than 200 million people worldwide and accounts for more than 500,000 deaths per year. Most deaths occur among children living in Africa where a child dies every minute of malaria and the disease accounts for approximately 20% of all childhood deaths.  Professor Patrick Maxwell, chair of the MRC s Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board, said:  Tackling malaria is a global challenge, with the parasite continually working to find ways to survive our drug treatments. By combining a number of techniques to piece together how the malaria parasite survives, this study opens the door on potential new treatments that could find and exploit the disease s weak spots but with limited side-effects for patients.

The findings suggest how biochemists might be able to decrease drug resistance to existing therapies that target this form of cancer, the authors report in the July 2 issue of the journal Molecular Cell.  We can design specific targets for drug development only if we fully understand the key players and how they work in the pathway for repairing DNA breaks,  said Patrick Sung, professor in the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, researcher at the Yale Cancer Center, and senior author of the paper. BRCA genes normally act to repair damaged DNA and suppress tumor formation. Variants of BRCA genes, however, are hijacked by cancer and have been recognized for decades as markers for increased risk of breast cancer, but they also play a role in ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Drugs that target DNA repair pathways in patients with BRCA mutations have proved effective in attacking cancer, but these patients tend to develop resistance to the drug. The cancer returns because the BRCA proteins develop secondary mutations, which continue to promote cancer growth. The new paper establishes the crucial role played by co-factor DSS1, which mimics DNA that aids in the repair damage of cells. Without DSS1, BRCA2 variant cannot fulfill its normal duty of DNA repair crucial to survival of cancer. Drugs that interfere with DSS1 function could be developed and used in conjunction with existing drugs like Astra Zeneca s Lynparza to overcome this resistance, Sung said.","Published: July 7, 2015"

The experimental vaccine was discovered and developed by scientists at the Oregon National Primate Research Center at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland. The scientists were funded with a $7.2 million grant from NIAID, awarded in 2009. The new vaccine is being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, one of NIAID s Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs). Most commonly spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes, West Nile Virus (WNV) infection is typically a seasonal epidemic in the United States that begins in late spring or early summer and continues into the fall. Last year, 2,205 cases of WNV disease and 97 related deaths were reported in the United States. The majority of people infected with WNV will show no symptoms. Roughly 1 in 5 people who are infected will display relatively mild symptoms, such as fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and vomiting. Only about 1 in 150 people infected with WNV will develop a serious neurologic illness, such as encephalitis or meningitis. Most people with WNV disease recover completely, but the elderly and other immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for long-term side effects or death resulting from infection. From 1999 to 2014, a total of 41,762 cases of WNV disease have been confirmed in the United States, including 1,765 deaths. Although an effective veterinary vaccine against WNV is available, no human vaccine has been approved for commercial use.  Since first appearing in the United States in 1999, West Nile Virus has emerged as an important health threat in this country. NIAID is committed to research efforts to advance a preventive vaccine that could protect people against West Nile Virus infection,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. The OHSU research team, led by senior scientist Mark Slifka, Ph.D., created the investigational vaccine, called HydroVax-001, with a novel, hydrogen peroxide-based process that renders the virus inactive while still maintaining key immune-system triggering surface structures. The virus used to make the vaccine is inactivated and cannot cause WNV infection. Because it is inactivated, the experimental vaccine likely could be used in a diverse population, including immunologically vulnerable groups, such as the elderly. In preclinical studies, the test vaccine was effective at protecting mice against a lethal dose of West Nile Virus. In mice, the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody responses and CD8+ T cells, which bind to and kill infected cells. The clinical trial will test the safety of the vaccine as well as its ability to produce an immune response. The trial will enroll 50 healthy men and women, ages 18 to 50 years. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive a low dose of the vaccine (one microgram), a higher dose (four micrograms), or a placebo. Forty volunteers will receive the investigational vaccine; 10 study volunteers will receive the placebo. Each participant will receive an intramuscular injection twice: on day one and on day 29. Study participants will be followed for 14 months. The clinical trial is being conducted by researchers at Duke University, one of nine NIAID VTEUs. Enrollment is expected to be completed by December 2015.","Published: July 7, 2015"

Its main objective is to reach a level of international excellence in nanomedicine characterization for medical indications like cancer, diabetes, inflammatory diseases or infections, and make it accessible to all organizations developing candidate nanomedicines prior to their submission to regulatory agencies to get the approval for clinical trials and, later, marketing authorization.  As reported in the ETPN White Paper, there is a lack of infrastructure to support nanotechnology-based innovation in healthcare,  said Patrick Boisseau, head of business development in nanomedicine at CEA-Leti and chairman of the European Technology Platform Nanomedicine (ETPN).  Nanocharacterisation is the first bottleneck encountered by companies developing nanotherapeutics. The EU-NCL project is of most importance for the nanomedicine community, as it will contribute to the competiveness of nanomedicine products and tools and facilitate regulation in Europe.  EU-NCL is partnered with the sole international reference facility, the Nanotechnology Characterization Lab of the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. (US-NCL), to get faster international harmonization of analytical protocols.  We are excited to be part of this cooperative arrangement between Europe and the U.S.,  said Scott E. McNeil, director of U.S. NCL.  We hope this collaboration will help standardize regulatory requirements for clinical evaluation and marketing of nanomedicines internationally. This venture holds great promise for using nanotechnologies to overcome cancer and other major diseases around the world.  EU-NCL is also closely connected to national medicine agencies and the European Medicines Agency to continuously adapt its analytical services to requests of regulators. EU-NCL is designed, organized and operated according to the highest EU regulatory and quality standards. This project is important for Europe, as it will be the first transnational infrastructure in nano-medicine. It aims at fostering innovation by sharing knowledge and technologies between academia and industry. The mission of EU-NCL is:  To provide a trans-disciplinary testing infrastructure covering a comprehensive set of preclinical characterization assays (physical, chemical, in-vitro and in-vivo biological testing), allowing researchers to fully comprehend the biodistribution, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, safety profiles and immunological effects of their medicinal nano-products.  To foster the use and deployment of standard operating procedures (SOPs), benchmark materials and quality management for the preclinical characterization of medicinal nano-products.  To promote intersectoral and interdisciplinary communication among key drivers of innovation, especially between developers and regulatory agencies. This project, led by CEA-Tech (Leti and Liten, FR), brings together nine partners from eight countries:  Joint Research Centre - European Commission (IT)  European Research Services GmbH (DE),  Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/researchers-find-organization-human-brain-be-nearly-ideal-283384,Researchers find the organization of the human brain to be nearly ideal Have you ever wondered why the human brain evolved the way it did  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Have you ever wondered why the human brain evolved the way it did? A new study by Northeastern physicist Dmitri Krioukov and his colleagues suggests an answer: to expedite the transfer of information from one brain region to another, enabling us to operate at peak capacity. The paper, published this month in Nature Communications, reveals that the structure of the human brain has an almost ideal network of connections--the links that permit information to travel from, say, the auditory cortex (responsible for hearing) to the motor cortex (responsible for movement) so we can do everything from raise our hand in class in response to a question to rock out to the beat of The 1975. The findings represent more than a confirmation of our evolutionary progress. They could have important implications for pinpointing the cause of neurological disorders and eventually developing therapies to treat them. ""An optimal network in the brain would have the smallest number of connections possible, to minimize cost, and at the same time it would have maximum navigability--that is, the most direct pathways for routing signals from any possible source to any possible destination,"" says Krioukov. It's a balance, he explains, raising and lowering his hands to indicate a scale. The study presents a new strategy to find the connections that achieve that balance or, as he puts it, ""the sweet spot."" Krioukov, an associate professor in the Department of Physics, studies networks, from those related to massive Internet datasets to those defining our brains. In the new research, he and his co-authors used sophisticated statistical analyses based on Nobel laureate John Nash's contributions to game theory to construct a map of an idealized brain network--one that optimized the transfer of information. They then compared the idealized map of the brain to a map of the brain's real network and asked the question ""How close are the two?"" Remarkably so. They were surprised to learn that 89 percent of the connections in the idealized brain network showed up in the real brain network as well. ""That means the brain was evolutionarily designed to be very, very close to what our algorithm shows,"" says Krioukov. The scientists' strategy bucks tradition: It lets function--in this case, navigability--drive the structure of the idealized network, thereby showing which links are essential for optimal navigation. Most researchers in the field, says Krioukov, build models of the real network first, and only then address function, an approach that does not highlight the most crucial links. The new strategy is also transferable to a variety of disciplines. The study, whose co-authors are at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, mapped six diverse navigable networks in total, including that of the Internet, U.S. air ports, and Hungarian roads. The Hungarian road network, for example, gave travelers the ""luxury to go on a road trip without a map,"" the authors wrote. Future applications of the research cross disciplines, too. Knowing what links in a network are the most critical for navigation tells you where to focus protective measures, whether the site is the Internet, roadways, train routes, or flight patterns. ""Conversely, if you're a good guy facing a terrorist network, you know what links to attack first,"" says Krioukov. A systems designer could locate the missing connections necessary to maximize the navigability of a computer network and add them. In the brain, the links existing in the idealized network are likely those required for normal brain function, says Krioukov. He points to a maze of magenta and turquoise tangles coursing through a brain illustration in his paper and traces the magenta trail, which is present in both the ideal and real brains. ""So we suspect that they are the primary candidates to look at if some disease develops--to see if they are dam-aged or broken."" Looking to the future, he speculates that once such links are identified, new drugs or surgical techniques could perhaps be developed to target them and repair, or circumvent, the damage. ""At the end of the day, what we are trying to do is to fix the diseased network so that it can resume its normal function,"" says Krioukov.

In a study published in Clinical Neurophysiology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers reveal some key brainwave changes among patients receiving the drug. For a period of about three minutes after the administration of nitrous oxide at anesthetic doses, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings show large-amplitude slow-delta waves, a powerful pattern of electrical firing that sweeps across the front of the brain as slowly as once every 10 seconds. This frequency is characteristic of our deepest sleep, but the waves induced by nitrous oxide are twice as large as -- and seemingly more powerful than -- the ones seen in slumber. ""We literally watched it and marveled, because it was totally unexpected,"" says Emery Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering at MIT and an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). ""Nitrous oxide has control over the brain in ways no other drug does."" Brown was joined in the research by co-authors Kara Pavone, Oluwaseun Akeju, Aaron Sampson, Kelly Ling, and Patrick Purdon, all of MGH. The discovery came after Brown began recording EEG readings from all of his anesthesiology patients, starting in 2012. A sticker with six electrodes is placed on the forehead to measure voltage fluctuations resulting from the collective effect of neurons communicating in the brain. This EEG signal feeds into a computer that records it and displays the data as waves on a monitor in the operating room. The technique is safe and noninvasive. When family doctors explain anesthesia, they sometimes describe it as ""putting a patient to sleep,"" using the metaphor of our closest experiential comparison. But sleep is nothing like anesthesia; it is a natural physiological state of decreased arousal during which the brain cycles naturally between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM states approximately every 90 minutes. Someone can easily be awakened from even the deepest stages of sleep. Anesthesia, by comparison, is a drug-induced, reversible coma during which a patient is unconscious, cannot remember, feels no pain, and does not move -- yet is physiologically stable. This state of coma remains as long as the flow of drugs is maintained, and patients awake from anesthesia with the sensation that no time has passed. Nitrous oxide is commonly administered at the tail end of surgery, to keep a patient unconscious while more potent ether anesthetics clear from his or her system, or is administered along with the ether anesthetics throughout an operation to reduce the doses of the latter. Brown says that anesthesiologists should use an EEG to monitor the brain states of their patients under anesthesia -- which could make better anesthetic dosing decisions possible and alleviate concerns about awareness under anesthesia. ""It's hard to imagine that in 2015 you can just anecdotally observe this,"" Brown says. He speculates that if the pure, powerful slow waves produced by nitrous oxide could somehow be maintained at a steady state -- as opposed to disappearing in mere minutes -- then nitrous oxide might be used as a potent anesthetic from which rapid recovery would be possible. It remains a mystery why these large, slow waves only continue for around three minutes, despite continuous administration of nitrous oxide. Brown says there appears to be a sort of rapid habituation or desensitization process at work. He postulates that nitrous oxide may block signals from the brainstem that would otherwise maintain wakefulness. When certain receptors in the thalamus and cortex are not bound by nitrous oxide, these brain regions normally receive excitatory signals from arousal centers lower in the brain. Without those signals, loss of consciousness occurs, marked by slow waves. ""If you see slow EEG oscillations, think of something having happened to the brainstem,"" Brown says. ""It is worth pointing out that nitrous oxide has been shown previously to affect these low-frequency oscillations, but by causing a decrease rather than an increase,"" says neurobiologist David Liley of Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, who was not involved in the research. Previous research has largely explored lower doses of nitrous oxide -- levels at which it is considered a sedative, inducing faster beta oscillations in the brain, which are indicative of relaxation but not loss of consciousness. ""The nice thing about Emery's study is that they could use high concentrations at high flow rates, which if used alone in healthy, initially conscious volunteers would cause way too much nausea and vomiting,"" Liley says. Brown and his team are now systematically studying the EEG signatures and behavioral effects of all of the principal anesthetics and anesthetic combinations.

The molecule in question, known as beta-2 microglobulin, or B2M, is a component of a larger molecule called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex class I), which plays a major role in the adaptive immune system. A growing body of research indicates that the B2M-MHC I complex, which is present in all cells in the body except red blood cells and plasma cells, can act in the brain in ways not obviously related to immunity--guiding brain development, shaping nerve cell communication, and even affecting behavior. ""We are in the process of elucidating the exact mechanism by which B2M works,"" said Saul A. Villeda, PhD, a UCSF Faculty Fellow and co-senior author of the new study. ""Since B2M increases with age, both in the blood and in the brain, we want to know what is the 'traditional' immune contribution to effects on cognition, and what is the non-traditional neural contribution."" In 2014, highly publicized work in the laboratories of Villeda and Tony Wyss-Coray, PhD, professor of neurology at Stanford, showed that connecting the circulatory system of a young mouse to that of an old mouse could reverse the declines in learning ability that typically emerge as mice age. Over the course of their long-term research on so-called young blood, however, the researchers had noted an opposite effect: blood from older animals appears to contain ""pro-aging factors"" that suppress neurogenesis--the sprouting of new brain cells in regions important for memory--which in turn can contribute to cognitive decline. In the new research, published in Nature Medicine, Villeda and co-senior author Wyss-Coray again joined forces to follow up on these findings, as well as a range of studies correlating high B2M blood levels with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, HIV-associated dementia, and as a consequence of chronic dialysis for kidney disease. Members of the Villeda and Wyss-Coray labs first showed that B2M levels steadily rise with age in mice, and are also higher in young mice in which the circulatory system is joined to that of an older mouse. These findings were confirmed in humans, in whom B2M levels rose with age in both blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes the brain. When B2M was administered to young mice, either via the circulatory system or directly into the brain, the mice performed poorly on tests of learning and memory compared to untreated mice, and neurogenesis was also suppressed in these mice. These experiments were complemented by genetic manipulations in which some mice were engineered to lack a gene known as Tap1, which is crucial for the MHC I complex to make its way to the cell surface. In these mice, administration of B2M in young mice had no significant effect, either in tests of learning or in assessments of neurogenesis. The group also bred mice missing the gene for B2M itself. These mice performed better than their normal counterparts on learning tests well into old age, and their brains did not exhibit the decline in neurogenesis typically seen in aged mice. Villeda emphasized that the effects on learning observed in the B2M-administration experiments were reversible: 30 days after the B2M injections, the treated mice performed as well on tests as untreated mice, indicating that B2M-induced cognitive decline in humans could potentially be treated with targeted drugs. ""From a translational perspective, we are interested in developing antibodies or small molecules to target this protein late in life,"" said Villeda. ""Since B2M goes up with age in blood, CSF, and also in the brain itself, this allows us multiple avenues in which to target this protein therapeutically.""

Professor Jozef Gecz, from the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute, was a key player in identifying the responsible gene and mutations in this female-only epileptic syndrome, in 2008. In breakthrough research published in Oxford Journals, Human Molecular Genetics, Professor Gecz has now found a treatment for this disorder. A United States pharmaceutical company Marinus Pharmaceuticals is now recruiting affected girls as part of the world's first clinical trial to test the therapy. Professor Gecz says this condition is unique as it presents almost exclusively in girls while boys with mutations in the gene are not affected. ""We discovered that this condition is caused by an inherited mutation of the protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) gene, located on the X-chromosome,"" says Professor Gecz, Head of Neurogenetics at the University of Adelaide. ""And interestingly, both males and females can be born with this mutation but only females suffer from the symptoms of the condition. ""The girls are affected because they have two X-chromosomes, one healthy and one with the PCDH19 mutation, which would usually protect them from a X-chromosome borne disease, but in this case it drives the disorder,"" he says. Professor Gecz has worked with the families of girls with this female-only epilepsy from all over the world and says while the condition affects everyone differently, in most cases it is highly incapacitating. ""This form of epilepsy affects 15,000-30,000 girls in the US and approximately 1000 in Australia,"" says Professor Gecz. ""Girls born with this gene mutation appear perfectly normal in the first few months of their lives but when they reach about eight months of age, they start suffering from debilitating and frequent seizures. The girls also commonly suffer from intellectual disability and autism -- it's a truly terrible disease which impacts the whole family. ""Through our current research we found that sufferers are deficient in a hormone called allopregnanolone. ""We know that hormones play a critical role in this condition because the seizures often stop once the girls reach puberty -- however the autism and intellectual disability remain. We expect that the longer we can delay the onset of seizures, the less the sufferer might be affected by the autism and intellectual disability. ""These finding are so promising that Marinus Pharmaceuticals has commenced a clinical trial to test the effect of a synthetic form of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, called ganaxolone,"" he says.

But assembling all of the genetic pieces needed to engineer these new microbial strains can be slow.  Building a novel organism can take a lot of trial and error, says Steve C. C. Shih, a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Anup K. Singh at Sandia National Laboratories, in Livermore, Calif., and the Joint BioEnergy Institute. First, scientists must identify a gene that could give an organism a desired function. They must then put the gene into a ring of DNA called a plasmid that carries it into the cell and facilitates gene expression. Finally, they test the new microbe for the desired traits. This process often doesn t work the first time, so researchers have to go through this cycle many times, Shih says. One bottleneck is building plasmids, which requires substantial time in the lab. To speed the production of synthetic organisms, Shih and his colleagues developed a droplet-based microfluidic device that automates plasmid construction and delivery to cells. The device contains interconnecting pathways made from electrode  bricks.  To move a droplet of liquid along these pathways, Shih controls the electrodes, flipping the switch on one brick to create an electrostatic force that pulls a droplet along the pathway toward the next. Brick by brick, the researchers can move a droplet, or series of droplets, through the device s electrode pathways, assembling plasmids by drawing from different pools of DNA pieces, mixing them, incubating them, and then transfecting them into cells. In this proof-of-principle experiment, Shih s laboratory used the device to build 16 different plasmids all possible pairs of four different genes and four promoters, controllable on-off switches for gene expression. The team loaded the device s reservoirs with solutions of each gene, each promoter, the plasmid backbone, and the necessary reagents. To make the 16 different plasmids, the researchers drew droplets from the appropriate reservoirs and sent them into a mixing area on the device. They pulled the resulting droplets into a capillary, where all 16 droplets were kept separate but incubated together at the right temperature to complete the plasmid assembly. After incubation, the droplets moved, one by one, into a part of the device that contained either bacteria or yeast cells. An electrical charge then made the cell walls permeable to the plasmids, allowing them to enter the cells and create new organisms ready for testing. For both bacteria and yeast, subsequent gene-sequencing tests showed that 95% or more of the 16 plasmids  sequences were correct, Shih says, a promising result. Douglas Densmore of Boston University says this device is an  important step  for speeding the development of genetic building block libraries for synthetic biology. He d like to see a device that can make 100 or even 1,000 plasmids in a single run. Shih is working to increase output but is limited by how many electrodes will reasonably fit on the two-dimensional device. He s developing a 3-D microfluidic device, which would make it  very easy to increase the electrode density,  he says.","Published: July 6, 2015"

These findings have far-reaching implications for our basic understanding of pain, how we develop the next generation of medications for chronic pain which is by far the most prevalent human health condition and the way we execute basic biomedical research using mice.  Research has demonstrated that men and women have different sensitivity to pain and that more women suffer from chronic pain than men, but the assumption has always been that the wiring of how pain is processed is the same in both sexes,  said co-senior author Jeffrey Mogil, PhD, E.P. Taylor Professor of Pain Studies at McGill University and Director of the Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain.  The realization that the biological basis for pain between men and women could be so fundamentally different raises important research and ethical questions if we want to reduce suffering.  The research was conducted by teams from McGill University, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), and Duke University, and looked at the longstanding theory that pain is transmitted from the site of injury or inflammation through the nervous system using an immune system cell called microglia. This new research shows that this is only true in male mice. Interfering with the function of microglia in a variety of different ways effectively blocked pain in male mice, but had no effect in female mice. According to the researchers, a completely different type of immune cell, called T cells, appears to be responsible for sounding the pain alarm in female mice. However, exactly how this happens remains unknown.  Understanding the pathways of pain and sex differences is absolutely essential as we design the next generation of more sophisticated, targeted pain medications,  said Michael Salter, MD, PhD, Head and Senior Scientist, Neurosciences & Mental Health at SickKids and Professor at The University of Toronto, the other co senior author.  We believe that mice have very similar nervous systems to humans, especially for a basic evolutionary function like pain, so these findings tell us there are important questions raised for human pain drug development.  The discovery comes as there is increased attention to the inclusion of female animals and cells in preclinical research. The U.S. National Institutes of Health recently unveiled a new policy, similar to one already in force in Canada, to require the use of female animals and cell lines in preclinical research.  For the past 15 years scientists have thought that microglia controlled the volume knob on pain, but this conclusion was based on research using almost exclusively male mice,  said Mogil.  This finding is a perfect example of why this policy, and very carefully designed research, is essential if the benefits of basic science are to serve everyone. ","Published: July 6, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/colitis-in-infants-caused-by-their-own-intestinal-flora-190965,Colitis in Infants Caused by Their Own Intestinal Flora  Researchers uncover links between an imbalanced gut flora and Colitis in infants   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The existing explanatory model for the development of a special form of colitis in infants is currently being called into question: Whereas it was previously assumed that the cause is an allergic reaction to cow's milk proteins, there is increasing evidence that an imbalanced intestinal flora is responsible for the blood-streaked stools. In an Austrian Science Fund FWF project, Martin Hoffmann from the Medical University of Graz is now systematically examining this new evidence for the first time. Distal allergic proctocolitis, as it is known, is an inflammation of the rectum and colon that rarely occurs in infants. The leading symptoms (bloody stools) are alarming for both parents and physicians, although the affected infants appear to be otherwise healthy. It is generally assumed that the cause of the disease is an allergic reaction to cow's milk proteins. Indeed, in most cases, the inflammation disappears when the infant's nutrition is changed. But Martin Hoffmann believes there is another cause   and will now investigate this in the context of a systematic study. Microbiome Research ""There are good reasons to assume that a change in the intestinal flora is the true cause of infant proctocolitis"", says the pediatrician, who has already found solid evidence for this hypothesis in initial studies. For instance, preliminary studies in infants with proctocolitis showed the far more frequent occurrence of the bacterium Klebsiella oxytoca. Although this bacterium is known to be able to trigger colitis in connection with treatment with antibiotics, the symptoms are not identical to those for infant proctocolitis. Hoffmann therefore proposes that the bacterium is not the actual cause: ""The more frequent occurrence of Klebsiella oxytoca is probably a consequence of an overall change in the intestinal flora, a so-called dysbiosis. If the normal balance of the intestinal flora is upset, harmful bacteria such as Klebsiella oxytoca can run rampant."" The current therapy concept of changing the infant's nutrition by eliminating cow's milk would then result in the normalisation of the intestinal flora and not   as previously assumed   in the termination of allergic reactions. Mounting Evidence Hoffmann's assumption is, in fact, shared by international colleagues who likewise analysed the composition of the intestinal flora of infants with proctocolitis   and were able to detect clear changes. Further indications that the existing explanatory model of an allergic reaction should be questioned came from studies that searched for specific evidence of allergic reactions   and none could be found. Clarifying Study To clarify more precisely whether the intestinal flora of infants with proctocolitis is comprehensively altered, an extensive study will now be conducted in Graz using stool samples from up to 130 infants. The study will compare stool samples of infants with and without proctocolitis. One of the challenges for the project is to register all the different types of bacteria. The tool of choice is a genetic method known as 16s-rRNA analysis. This method examines special genetic sections, making it possible to differentiate a broad range of different types of bacteria. Flexible Intestinal Flora Hoffmann explains a further challenge for the project: ""In fact, the intestinal flora of children changes naturally over the course of their first year. Against this backdrop, it is difficult to register additional changes due to illness. We will therefore analyse for each child individually how the intestinal flora changes within an eight-week period   and we expect to detect different patterns in the two study groups. That would be a clear indication that a dysbiosis is indeed responsible for the infant proctocolitis."" The confirmation of this hypothesis would then be sufficient reason for Hoffmann to consider a paradigm shift in the explanatory model   and also in the therapy   of cow's-milk-protein-associated infant proctocolitis.","Published: July 6, 2015"

RNAi is mediated by RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains a small RNA and an Argonaute protein at its core and cleaves the target RNA. However, there were no suitable tools to directly monitor the RNAi reaction and its molecular mechanism by which RISC cleaves the target RNA has remained unclear. Now, a research group at the University of Tokyo (Professor Takuya Ueda, Professor Yukihide Tomari, Researcher Chunyan Yao and Research Associate Hiroshi M Sasaki,) and at Kyoto University (Researcher Hisashi Tadakuma), has developed a single-molecule imaging assay for observing target RNA cleavage by RISC in a test tube in real time for the first time, showing how RISC accurately cleaves and releases targets. Specifically, their obsercations provide direct evidence for the model that the small RNA in the RISC consists of two parts, one of which quickly binds to the target RNA to be cleaved, while the other proofreads that the correct RNA has been found. This groundbreaking result reveals RISC s molecular mechanism of action and the illustration of this process was adopted as the cover design of this issue of the journal. This achievement will also contribute to accelerating the research applications of RNAi such as to the development of RNA-based next-generation drugs, for example as gene therapy to suppress the production of a disease-causing protein.","Published: July 6, 2015"

Globally, about 35 million people are living with HIV, which constantly adapts and mutates creating challenges for researchers. Now, scientists at the University of Missouri are gaining a clearer idea of what a key protein in HIV looks like, which will help explain its vital role in the virus  life cycle. Armed with this clearer image of the protein, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how the body can combat the virus with the ultimate aim of producing new and more effective antiviral drugs. The capsid shell acts as an  invisibility cloak  that hides the virus  genetic information, the genome, while it is being copied in a hostile environment for the virus,  said Sarafianos, who also holds an appointment in the Department of Biochemistry in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and serves as a researcher at the Bond Life Sciences Center.  Fine-tuned capsid stability is critical for successful infection: too stable a capsid shell and the cargo is never delivered properly; not stable enough and the contents are detected by our immune defenses, triggering an antiviral response. Capsid stability is a key to the puzzle, and you have to understand its structure to solve it.  Sarafianos and his team created the most complete model yet of an HIV capsid protein. The research team used a technique called X-ray crystallography to unravel the protein s secrets. By taking many copies of the protein, they coaxed them into forming a patterned, crystalline lattice (see photo).  With X-ray crystallography, the biggest challenge is to get protein crystals of good quality that will allow researchers to accurately study the protein,  said Anna Gres, an MU graduate student in the Department of Chemistry and first author of the study.  Sometimes this process can take years, but by using advanced techniques, we were able to cut that down considerably. Next they shot high-powered X-ray beams at the crystal. By interpreting how the X-rays scattered when they ricocheted off the proteins, the researchers made a 3-D map of the protein.  But the 3-D map doesn t make sense until we make an atomic model of the protein to fit in that map,  said Karen Kirby, a research scientist at Bond LSC and co-author of the study.  The map is just a grid that you can t really interpret unless you put a model into it to see  Ok, it looks like this part is here, and that part is there, and this is how the protein is put together.  Gres constructed the model, which surprisingly revealed  ordered  water molecules at areas between the viral proteins.  We thought,  How could some simple water molecules really be of consequence?  Sarafianos said.  But when we looked carefully, we realized there are thousands of waters that help stabilize the complex capsid scaffold. We hypothesized that this is an essential part of the stability of the whole capsid assembly.  To test that hypothesis, they dehydrated the crystals using chemicals and noticed that the proteins in them changed shape. This change suggested that water molecules help the capsid shell to be flexible and assume different forms, which is critical for the life cycle of the virus, Sarafianos said. The National Institutes of Health recently awarded the team a grant of $2.28 million over five years to continue their study. Future studies using the newly developed model will assist Sarafianos and his team as they work toward developing antiviral drugs that combat the disease by taking advantage of the new findings.

Enzymes are extraordinary biocatalysts able to speed up the cellular, chemical reactions several million times. This increase of speed is completely necessary for all biological life, which would otherwise be limited by the slow nature of vital chemical reactions. Now, a research group at the Department of Chemistry has discovered a new aspect in enzymes that, in part, explains how enzymes manage their tasks with unmatched efficiency and selectivity. So-called high-energy states in enzymes are regarded as necessary for catalysing of chemical reactions. A high-energy level is a protein structure only occurring temporarily and for a short period of time; and these factors collaborate until its state becomes invisible to traditional spectroscopic techniques. The Ume  researchers have managed to find a way to maintain a high-energy state in the enzyme, adenylate kinase, by mutating the protein. ""Thanks to this enrichment, we have been able to study both structure and dynamics of this state. The study shows that enzymatic high-energy states are necessary for chemical catalysis,"" says Magnus Wolf-Watz, research group leader at the Department of Chemistry. The study also indicates a possibility to fine-tune the dynamics of an enzyme and this possibility can be useful for researchers in developing new enzymes for catalysis of new chemical reactions.

Researchers used a technique called electron cryo-microscopy, or 'cryo-EM'   imaging samples frozen to -180 C   to show the proteasome complex in such extraordinary detail that they could view a prototype drug bound to its active sites. The results could help improve scientists' ability to build molecules that interlock very specifically with target sites on proteins   a fundamental part of designing new anti-cancer drugs. Scientists from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge were able to visualise the proteasome complex down to a resolution of around 3.5 Angstroms, or 3.5 ten-billionths of a metre. The research could help other scientists to use cryo-EM in structure-based drug design studies   in which researchers build the best possible drugs starting from a molecule which already binds to the active site of a target protein. Until recently, such studies were generally only possible using X-ray crystallography, but researchers have been unable to crystallise many protein complexes in order to study them using that technique. The proteasome plays a key role in the smooth running of a healthy cell, facilitating cell renewal and death   chopping up proteins tagged for destruction into short polypeptides which can then be converted to amino-acids and recycled for use in building new proteins. It plays an important role in cell division, which is controlled by the synchronised destruction of regulatory proteins. Blocking the proteasome prevents this regulated recycling of amino acids and triggers controlled cell death, particularly in fast-dividing cells typical of cancer. Some cancer drugs have already been developed to target it. Images produced by the study clearly show the structure of the proteasome complex   with the protein backbone of each of its 28 subunits visible along with most of the side chains of the proteins. An inhibitor molecule used by the researchers was shown to be visibly bound at each of its three target sites on the proteasome. Electron cryo-microscopy is emerging as a complementary approach in cancer drug design to X-ray crystallography   which involves generating highly ordered crystals of proteins and hitting them with X-ray radiation. Cryo-EM offers the opportunity to study protein complexes in conditions closer to those in the human body. In this experiment, researchers rapidly froze samples of the proteasome bound to the inhibitor to allow them to be examined in the electron microscope at -180oC. They bombarded their samples with electrons and generated images using complex image-processing software. Senior study author Dr Edward Morris, Team Leader in Structural Electron Microscopy at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ""Our study zooms in to display the proteasome complex   a recycling unit which plays a critical role in our cells   in far greater detail than we have ever seen before in the electron microscope.

The findings are published by Neuro-Oncology: Clinical Practice. Because of the rarity of low-grade gliomas, the disease remains understudied. The optimal management strategies for these tumors also remain controversial. Decisions of when and whether to administer radiation, what type of surgery to perform, and what type of chemotherapy to use, if any, varies widely among physicians. ""An understanding of how our treatments affect the survival of low-grade glioma patients will better enable us to help these patients,"" said senior author Clark C. Chen, M.D., Ph.D., vice chairman of research and academic development, division of neurosurgery, UC San Diego School of Medicine. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, a national cancer registry sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, Chen's team demonstrated that the median survival of patients afflicted with low-grade gliomas increased from 44 months (in 1999) to 57 months (in 2010). This is the first time that such increased survival has been reported. The study suggests that the survival improvement is due to the development of more effective chemotherapies. Interestingly, the improved survival occurred despite a decreased use of radiation therapy at the time when low-grade glioma is first diagnosed. ""The decrease in the use of radiation started in 2005, concomitant to the publication of an important European randomized control study that demonstrated no significant survival benefit whether radiation was delivered at the time of diagnosis or later in the clinical course,"" said Xuezhi Dong, the study's first author. While many previous studies suggest that complete excision of low-grade gliomas is associated with longer patient survival, this latest study found that only about a third of U.S. patients underwent complete surgical resection. Notably, this number remained unchanged throughout the past decade. ""The lack of improvement in surgical resection is likely limited by the availability of technologies, such as intra-operative MRI, to allow surgeons to perform maximal surgical resection,"" said Bob S. Carter, M.D., Ph.D., chief of neurosurgery at UC San Diego Health. ""The completion of an advanced surgical suite with an intra-operative MRI at Jacobs Medical Center in 2016 at UC San Diego Health will afford us an unprecedented opportunity to achieve maximal surgical resection of low-grade glioma and set forth new surgical standards for the care of this patient population.""

These cells, called microglia, often play a beneficial role by helping to clear trash and protect the central nervous system against infection. But a new study by researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI) shows that they also accelerate damage wrought by blinding eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa. NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, USA.  These findings are important because they suggest that microglia may provide a target for entirely new therapeutic strategies aimed at halting blinding eye diseases of the retina,  said NEI Director, Paul A. Sieving, M.D.  New targets create untapped opportunities for preventing disease-related damage to the eye, and preserving vision for as long as possible.  The findings were published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine. Retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disorder that affects roughly 1 in 4,000 people, damages the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Research has shown links between retinitis pigmentosa and several mutations in genes for photoreceptors, the cells in the retina that convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. In the early stages of the disease, rod photoreceptors, which enable us to see in low light, are lost, causing night blindness. As the disease progresses, cone photoreceptors, which are needed for sharp vision and seeing colors, can also die off, eventually leading to complete blindness. Lead investigator, Wai T. Wong M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Unit on Neuron-Glia Interactions in Retinal Disease at NEI, and his team studied mice with a mutation in a gene that can also cause retinitis pigmentosa in people. The researchers observed in these mice that very early in the disease process, the microglia infiltrate a layer of the retina near the photoreceptors, called the outer nuclear layer, where they don t usually venture. The microglia then create a cup-like structure over a single photoreceptor, surrounding it to ingest it in a process called phagocytosis. Wong and his team caught this dynamic process on video. The whole feast, including digestion, takes about an hour. Phagocytosis is a normal process in healthy tissues and is a key way of clearing away dead cells and cellular debris. However, in retinitis pigmentosa the researchers found that the microglia target damaged but living photoreceptors, in addition to dead ones. To confirm that microglia contribute to the degeneration process, the researchers genetically eliminated the microglia, which slowed the rate of rod photoreceptor death and the loss of visual function in the mice. Inhibiting phagocytosis with a compound had a similar effect. The microglia seem to ignore cone photoreceptors, which fits with the known early course of retinitis pigmentosa.  These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit microglial activation may help decelerate the rate of rod photoreceptor degeneration and preserve vision,  Wong said. What triggers microglia to go on this destructive feeding frenzy? Wong and colleagues found evidence that photoreceptors carrying mutations undergo physiological stress. The stress then triggers them to secrete chemicals dubbed  find me  signals, which is like ringing a dinner bell that attracts microglia into the retinal layer. Once there, the microglia probe the photoreceptors repeatedly, exposing themselves to  eat me  signals, which then trigger phagocytosis. In response to all the feasting, the microglia become activated. That is, they send out their own signals to call other microglia to the scene and they release substances that promote inflammation. Other potential treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, such as gene therapy, are progressing, but are not without challenges. Gene therapy requires replacing defective genes with functional genes, yet more than 50 distinct genes have been linked to the disease in different families, so there s no one-size-fits-all gene therapy. A therapy targeting microglia might complement gene therapy because it s an approach that s independent of the specific genetic cause of retinitis pigmentosa, said Wong. A clinical trial (NCT02140164) is already underway at NEI to see if the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline can block the activation of microglia and help slow the progression of retinitis pigmentosa. The trial is currently recruiting participants. NIH's National Eye Institute (NEI)   press release Wong WT et al.

Two studies published this week in PLOS Pathogens report progress with novel tools and paradigms to study prion disease. Several research groups have recently succeeded in generating infectious prions with prion protein produced by bacteria in test tubes under consistent and controlled conditions. Such synthetic prions are a critical tool to study how prions cause disease in general and to test the ""protein-only"" hypothesis, which states that the mutant prion protein itself can trigger the disease by co-opting other prion proteins to form aggregates that are toxic to nerve cells. Jiyan Ma, from the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids, USA, and colleagues tested whether the properties of synthetically generated prions are the same as those of natural disease-causing prions, and whether the disease caused by synthetic prions is identical to naturally occurring prion disease. They demonstrate that similar to the classical disease-causing prions, synthetic prions are infectious in a concentration-dependent way, and are able to cause prion disease in normal mice not only by direct injection into the brain (which is the easiest but not a naturally occurring way of prion transmission) but also by other routes. The researchers also show that the synthetic prions induced pathological changes typical for classic prion disease, including the dissemination of disease-specific prion protein accumulation and the route and mechanism of invasion of nerve cells in the brain. They conclude that their results ""demonstrate the similarity of synthetically generated prion to the infectious agent in TSEs [transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, another term for prion diseases] and provide strong supporting evidence for the prion hypothesis."" About 15% of human prion disease is heritable and caused by dominant mutations in the human PRP gene. The mutations are thought to predispose the resulting PRP protein proteins to adapt the disease conformation and trigger the cascade that kills nerve cells. Much of the study of inherited human prion disease in mice has focused on mixing mutant human prions--isolated from human patients or produced by transgenic mice carrying the mutant human gene--with normal mouse prions in order to establish whether the mutant human prions are infectious, i.e. whether they can change normal proteins to the disease-associated conformation (or shape). John Collinge, from University College London, UK, and colleagues answered a crucial question regarding such studies, namely whether superimposition of pathogenic human PrP mutation into mouse PrP (which is similar but not identical) will have the same structural consequences as occur in the human brain. They focused on a specific mutation underlying an inherited form of human prion disease called Gerstmann-Str ussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease. This mutation causes an amino-acid substitution (proline-to-leucine) in the prion protein, human PrP 102L for short. In the brain of patients with GSS disease, this mutant prion (GSS-102L) co-exists with a heterogeneous mixture of normal PrP and other PrP derivatives, which it somehow manages to co-opt into forming aggregates that are toxic to the nerve cells. To characterize the transmission capabilities of the GSS-associated prions, the researchers tested whether the ability of GSS P102L to cause prion disease in mice depended on what other types of prion proteins and derivatives were present. They examined whether GSS P102L prions could infect transgenic mice that express human mutant 102L PrP, human normal PrP, or normal mouse PrP. Injecting a pure preparation of GSS P102L prions into the brains of the three different types of mice, they found that GSS P102L prions can only infect transgenic mice expressing human 102L PrP, i.e. those carrying the identical mutant human gene. Mice expressing normal human PrP or normal mouse PrP were completely resistant to infection with GSS-102L prions. ""Collectively"", the researchers say, their data ""establish that GSS-102L prions which replicate with high efficiency in a host expressing human PrP 102L are unable to propagate using wild-type [normal] human PrP or wild-type mouse PrP as substrate."" These results differ from the reported transmission properties of prions generated in GSS-P102L challenged mice expressing mouse PrP 101L (the equivalent mutation in the closely related but not identical mouse PrP): such prions readily infect animals expressing normal human or normal mouse PrP. Commenting on the discrepancy, the researchers suggest that the superimposition of the human on the mouse mutation might have generated experimental prion strains with different transmission characteristics from those of authentic human prion strains. Overall, they conclude that ""future transgenic modeling of infectious prion diseases should focus exclusively on expression of mutant human PrP, as other approaches may generate novel experimental prion strains that are unrelated to human disease."" Better tools and better paradigms to study prion diseases should help the understanding of how these diseases spread and devastate mammalian brains, and eventually lead to efficient treatment and prevention strategies.

This is the first time bacteria have been shown to influence aggression, said corresponding author Jeremy C. Brownlie, PhD, Deputy Head, School of Natural Sciences, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia. The research began with a discovery by University of Arizona student Elizabeth Bondy, an undergraduate with unusually sharp powers of observation who was working in Brownlie's lab. Male fruit flies normally fight each other, but Bondy, who was being trained to handle the insects, noticed that those infected with a particular strain of Wolbachia appeared to fight less aggressively than their uninfected peers. So Bondy and Chelsie E. Rohrscheib, a PhD student in Brownlie's lab, set up a home video camera to record the fighting. The researchers used three parameters to measure aggression: length of time to initiation of fighting, total number of fights, and the average duration of a bout. The investigators then compared the infected fruit flies' fighting behavior with that of fruit flies that had never been infected, and with fruit flies that had been cured of their Wolbachia infections. Infected flies took three times longer than the others to initiate their first fight, and started only half as many fights. However, the infected flies' bouts lasted as long as those of uninfected counterparts. The latter point is important, because it shows the reduced aggression was not due to sickness, said Brownlie. The investigators also measured the neurotransmitter, octopamine, which regulates fruit fly aggression. As expected, infected flies produced less of the compound than their uninfected peers. They also showed reduced expression of two genes that encode enzymes responsible for producing octopamine. ""That suggested that Wolbachia directly affects fruit fly gene function,"" said Brownlie. Wolbachia infect at least 40 percent of all insect species, as well as other invertebrates, but they do not infect vertebrate animals. These bacteria manipulate host reproduction to transmit themselves to host offspring, and they can also alter sex selection. They have also been shown to influence host metabolic pathways, to protect hosts from pathogens, to influence life span, and even to play a role in speciation, said Brownlie. For scientists, the fact that the bacteria affected aggression just as much as certain genetic mutations should be taken as a signal that behavioral changes should not necessarily be ascribed to genetics, said Brownlie. And while it's dangerous to extrapolate from insects to humans, new findings are hinting that gut bacteria might have similar influence on human behavior.

You'd take a nice big sniff to breathe in the sweet but subtle floral scent. Upon walking into a public restroom, you'd likely do just the opposite--abruptly limiting the flow of air through your nose. Now, researchers reporting in the journal Current Biology have found that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) don't make this natural adjustment like other people do. Autistic children go right on sniffing in the same way, no matter how pleasant or awful the scent. The findings suggest that non-verbal tests related to smell might serve as useful early indicators of ASD, the researchers say. ""The difference in sniffing pattern between the typically developing children and children with autism was simply overwhelming,"" says Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Earlier evidence had indicated that people with autism have impairments in ""internal action models,"" the brain templates we rely on to seamlessly coordinate our senses and actions. It wasn't clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however. To find out, Sobel, along with Liron Rozenkrantz and their colleagues, presented 18 children with ASD and 18 normally developing children (17 boys and 1 girl in each group) with pleasant and unpleasant odors and measured their sniff responses. The average age of children in the study was 7. While typical children adjusted their sniffing within 305 milliseconds of smelling an odor, the researchers report, children on the autism spectrum showed no such response. That difference in sniff response between the two groups of kids was enough to correctly classify them as children with or without a diagnosis of ASD 81% of the time. Moreover, the researchers report that increasingly aberrant sniffing was associated with increasingly severe autism symptoms, based on social but not motor impairments. The findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet. ""We can identify autism and its severity with meaningful accuracy within less than 10 minutes using a test that is completely non-verbal and entails no task to follow,"" Sobel says. ""This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old. Such early diagnosis would allow for more effective intervention."" The researchers now plan to test whether the sniff-response pattern they've observed is specific to autism or whether it might show up also in people with other neurodevelopmental conditions. They also want to find out how early in life such a test might be used.

And, most likely, you are more right than you know. Within your brain, within individual brain cells, your transcriptional machinery keeps chugging along, turning genes on and off even switching gears. These gears are the histone spools around which genes are wound. The histone spools in brain cells, it turns out, are constantly being replaced. This process, called histone turnover, can alter gene expression in response to environmental changes and contribute to neuronal plasticity. It can even account, in part, for the brain s ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Histone turnover is a new concept, at least for brain cells, which unlike many other kinds of cells do not divide. Nondividing cells were long thought to have highly stable histones. Brain cells, for example, arrive all in one allotment, in the womb, and must last a lifetime. And so it was presumed that brain cells  epigenetic settings stayed the same.  We uncover a dramatic developmental profile of nucleosome occupancy across the lifespan of both rodents and humans, with the histone variant H3.3 accumulating to near-saturating levels throughout the neuronal genome by mid-adolescence,  wrote the authors of the Neuron paper.  Despite such accumulation, H3.3-containing nucleosomes remain highly dynamic in a modification-independent manner to control neuronal- and glial-specific gene expression patterns throughout life.  H3.3 is a version of the histone H3 with a small random genetic change in its code, and thus a small difference in its protein structure. Cells with this version of H3 frequently turn over their histones. To study histone composition in mouse nerve cells and related turnover, researchers fed young, post-weaning rodents a special diet containing lysines that were labeled with heavy isotopes. When examining the nerve cells, researchers explored whether the H3.3 variant was labeled with that stable isotope (""new"" histones) or if they were free of the label (""older"" histones). This was accomplished by isolating individual neurons from the mice and performing mass spectrometry. The prevalence of the labeled H3.3 demonstrated the fact that the older histones had been replaced with newer ones, indicating histone turnover. In humans, researchers used a technique called 14C/12C bomb pulse dating to measure turnover. The technique is based on the fact that high levels of radioactive carbon (14C) were released into the atmosphere during the 1950s and 1960s, when open-air nuclear bomb testing occurred following the Second World War. Researchers can take samples from cells (in this case, purified H3.3 samples from brain cells of postmortem human brains) and determine present 14C/12C ratios from the time of death against past atmospheric levels from the time of the subject's birth. As with the rodent observations, the researchers found that H3.3 turnover occurs in the human brain throughout life. Additionally, the researchers deliberately manipulated H3.3 dynamics in both embryonic and adult neurons, confirming the role of histone turnover in neuronal plasticity. The findings thus establish histone turnover as a critical, and new, regulator of cell-type specific transcription in the brain. ""Histone turnover, shown through our work with H3.3, is essential for the behavior of brain cells,"" said Dr. Maze, lead study of the Neuron paper and an assistant professor of pharmacology and systems therapeutics at the Icahn School of Medicine. ""Furthering our understanding of how the brain works, learns, forms new memories, and reacts to changes in the environment can help us to find new ways to treat neurodegenerative diseases and mental illness.""","Published: July 3, 2015"

Not only must they be given yearly, there s no guarantee the strains against which they protect will be the ones circulating once the season arrives.   While the conventional flu vaccine protects only against specific strains, usually three of them, our experiments show that by including modified antibodies within the vaccine it may be possible to elicit broad protection against many strains simultaneously,  says senior study author Jeffrey Ravetch, Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professor and head of the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology.  We believe these results may represent a preliminary step toward a universal flu vaccine, one that is effective against a broad range of the flu viruses. The team describes a new strategy that revolves around antibodies, immune proteins that target specific foreign proteins, called antigens. One end of the antibody latches on to an antigen, the other end, called the Fc region, binds to immune cells and so helps coordinate the immune response. It was already known that chemical modifications to antibodies  Fc region altered their interactions with immune cells, including B cells, which produce antibodies. In experiments that began with human volunteers, the team, led by Taia Wang, an instructor in clinical investigation, and Jad Maamary, a postdoc, both in Ravetch s lab, investigated how changes to this region might be used to bolster an immune response: namely the production of more potent antibodies against the flu virus. Every year in the United States, influenza is implicated in the deaths of thousands of people, mostly 65 and older, and causes serious disease in many others. The virus makes for a difficult target for vaccines because its strains are so diverse, and new ones are constantly emerging. Types A and B cause seasonal flu epidemics. Influenza A viruses are further broken down into subtypes based in part on their surface proteins, which include hemagglutinin, the  H  in H1N1, for example. The subtypes are further divided into strains. Currently, most flu vaccines in the United States are formulated to target a total of three or four viral strains: H1 and H3 influenza A viruses, plus influenza B virus strains. The strains are selected based on public health experts  predictions for the coming flu season. But sometimes they are wrong, rendering the shots ineffective. A universal flu vaccine has become something of a holy grail, and a number of strategies have been proposed to create it. Work in the Ravetch lab suggests a new alternative: chemical modifications to the Fc region of antibodies. These regions go on form complexes with vaccine antigens, which then modulate the evolving vaccine response. First, the researchers vaccinated healthy volunteers with a seasonal flu vaccine containing an inactivated strain of the H1N1 virus. They then tracked the volunteers  immune responses via blood samples, keeping an eye out for chemical modifications to antibodies against the hemagglutinin protein. About seven days after the vaccination, they saw a spike in sialylated antibodies, meaning sialic acid, an important signaling molecule, had been added at a specific spot on the Fc region. The greater the sialylation, the better a person s response to the vaccine. To tease apart how this chemical modification improves the immune response, the researchers used cell cultures and mice to study the effects of sialylated Fc regions binding to B cells. Their experiments revealed a complex interaction that ultimately pushes the B cells to produce antibodies with a higher affinity to their antigens. It begins when a sialylated Fc region binds to a receptor protein known as CD23 on the B cells, prompting CD23 to activate a second receptor, Fc RIIB, which, in turn, discourages B cells producing low affinity antibodies. In this way, the sialylation on Fc regions establishes a high threshold for the immune response, so that only B cells producing the highest affinity antibodies are activated. The result of the higher affinity was broad protection against H1 subtype influenza viruses. The researchers then used this knowledge to improve the vaccine itself. They modified the H1N1 vaccine so it contained not only protein from the virus itself, but also sialylated antibodies against that protein.  When we immunized mice with just the H1 protein from one strain or with the sialylated complexes containing the same viral protein, we found both offered equal protection against the same strain of flu. However, when we exposed them to strains expressing different versions of the H1 protein, only the sialylated immunizations offered protection,  Maamary says.  This was no small accomplishment, because H1 viruses can vary significantly from one another.   The new mechanism we have uncovered, by which a vaccine containing sialylated antibodies elicits broadly protective antibodies, could potentially be harnessed to reduce the tremendous morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza virus infections,  Wang says.  We are now looking into applying this strategy toward improving existing vaccines; ideally, this would result in a vaccine that provides life long immunity against flu infections.

We would also like to thank the Alpha-1 Foundation and The Alpha-1 Project, who have agreed to help support the development of ARC-AAT through funding and assistance with patient recruitment.  The ongoing Phase 1 trial of ARC-AAT is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single dose-escalation, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ARC-AAT and the effect on circulating AAT levels. The study has been enrolling in dose cohorts of six participants each, with participants randomized at a ratio of 2:1 (active:placebo) to receive a single intravenous injection of either ARC-AAT or placebo (normal saline). The study consists of two parts; Part A in healthy volunteers, which has been completed, and Part B to be conducted in patients with PiZZ genotype AATD. Dosing in patients begins at the highest dose level used in healthy volunteers and then continued dose escalation may proceed under the protocol. The study evaluates participants for 28 days following dosing, with additional follow-up if needed every 2 weeks until AAT levels return to baseline. ","Published: July 3, 2015"

The newly expanded strategic partnership will focus on the development of new immune-oncology experimental cancer models, along with other models, including diabetes and inflammation diseases, to advance immune-oncology translational research and the treatment of cancers and other diseases. Immune-oncology therapy has recently become an area of intense cancer pharmaceutical research, particularly with the recent regulatory approval of PD-1 antibody for the treatment of cancer. However, there are many scientific/medical questions remaining to be answered, including why only subsets of patients respond to the treatments and what combination strategies can significantly enhance the current clinical benefits.  Relevant experimental models can help to answer these questions.  However, there are few such useful cancer models, with full immuno-competency, that can be used for assessing immunotherapy.  In particular, many of the new generation immunotherapy drugs are biologics with species-specificity, which thus render traditional murine models inadequate.  The immediate focus of the newly expanded partnership will be to build and validate novel experimental immune-oncology models for cancer immunotherapy research, by leveraging the proprietary technologies of both institutions Crown Bioscience is the premier service provider of translational oncology and metabolic diseases research platforms, providing many unique disease models. It has one of the largest and most advanced translational oncology platforms featuring fully annotated collections of proprietary patient derived xenograft (PDX, HuPrime ) models (>1,300) and numerous  primary mouse tumor models (MuPrime ). NRCMM is a leading research organization specializing in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM), with vast resources, including a large collection of GEMMs, many of which mimic human cancers. Both parties have complementary expertise and experience in disease models (oncology/diabetes, etc.) and GEMMs. Both organizations announced a research collaboration during the first half of 2014, and have now decided to further expand this partnership and focus on the development of immune-oncology experimental models. The expanded partnership is expected to significantly enhance the research capabilities of both organizations in immune-oncology and will thus benefit the global research community fighting cancer.  After the signing of the agreement, Dr. Jean-Pierre Wery, Crown s President, commented:  Crown plays a leading role in providing cutting-edge translational platforms and cost effective drug development solutions for almost all the top pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Crown is also determined to play a key role in helping to develop immune-oncology therapies and is very happy to expand the partnership with NRCMM to offer the world new experimental solutions to immune-oncology problems. This collaboration will further strengthen Crown s leading position as the oncology translational medicine partner for drug discovery organizations worldwide.  Dr. Jay Liu, Deputy Director of NRCMM and CEO of NBIC, also commented:  As the leading research institute focusing on genetically engineered mice in China, NRCMM takes pride in its capability of creating innovative mouse models for the biomedical community and facilitating the development of new therapeutics. Working together with a world leading translational oncology service provider, such as Crown, the combined expertise of Crown in oncology and our GEMM can certainly offer great GEMM-based oncology platforms to our partners in China and around the world. We are certainly excited about this opportunity. ","Published: July 3, 2015"

We are very interested in engineering strong, elastic materials from proteins because so many of the tissues within the human body are elastic. If we want to use biomaterials to regenerate those tissues, we need elasticity and flexibility,  said Annabi, a co-senior author of the study.  Our hydrogel is very flexible, made from a biocompatible polypeptide and can be activated using light.   Hydrogels   jelly-like materials that can mimic the properties of human tissue   are widely used in biomedicine, but currently available materials have limitations. Some synthetic gels degrade into toxic chemicals over time, and some natural gels are not strong enough to withstand the flow of arterial blood through them,  said Khademhosseini. The new material, known as a photocrosslinkable elastin-like polypeptide-based (ELP) hydrogel, offers several benefits. This elastic hydrogel is formed by using a light-activated polypeptide. When exposed to light, strong bonds form between the molecules of the gel, providing mechanical stability without the need for any chemical modifiers to be added to the material. The team reports that ELP hydrogel can be digested overtime by naturally-occurring enzymes and does not appear to have toxic effects when tested with living cells in the lab. The team also found that they could control how much the material swelled as well its strength, finding that the ELP hydrogel could withstand more stretching than experienced by arterial tissue in the body.  Our hydrogel has many applications: it could be used as a scaffold to grow cells or it can be incorporated with cells in a dish and then injected to stimulate tissue growth,  said Annabi.  In addition, the material can be used as a sealant, sticking to the tissue at the site of injury and creating a barrier over a wound.  The researchers found that it was possible to combine the gel with silica nanoparticles   microscopic particles previously found to stop bleeding   to develop an even more powerful barrier to promote wound healing.  This could allow us to immediately stop bleeding with one treatment,  said Annabi.  We see great potential for use in the clinic. Our method is simple, the material is biocompatible, and we hope to see it solve clinical problems in the future.  Further investigation in pre-clinical models will be needed to test the material s properties and safety before approval for use in humans.","Published: July 3, 2015"

The conference will be held on Wednesday 11th February, at the headquarters of One Nucleus in Cambridge, UK and will welcome experts from renowned pharmaceutical companies and prominent academics working in oncology. Due to the significant time and financial costs associated with drug discovery, the global pharmaceutical industry is increasingly focusing on the use of modelling for the purposes of evaluating effective drug candidates prior to entering full clinical trials. By fostering a greater understanding of the translational platforms available and the role of PDX models in the development of new and novel drug candidates in oncology, the symposium aims to foster a greater understanding of the considerable benefits offered by pre-clinical screening technology.  Crown s symposium will feature many highly respected speakers from a wide range of prominent and renowned organisations from across the globe including Dr Anne Vaslin-Chessex, Sr. Scientific Officer at Debiopharm International S.A., Dr Aaron Cranston, Head of in vivo Pharmacology at Mission Therapeutics, Dr Mischa Houtkamp, Senior Scientist, Genmab, and Dr Hazel Jones, Head of Combination Therapies, CRUK. The chairman for the event will be Dr Martin Page, former Global Head of Oncology Research at Johnson & Johnson PRD and will include presentations from key opinion leaders including Professor Gary Middleton, Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Birmingham, Dr Karl Butterworth, Lecturer in Translational Radiation Biology at Queen s University Belfast and Dr Rajendra Kumari, CSO at Crown Bioscience UK Ltd. Dr Jean-Pierre Wery, President of Crown Bioscience, stated,  Crown is committed to facilitating the advancement of therapeutic discovery and development in the field of oncology. PDX models offer an extremely relevant screening platform for novel treatment compounds to development companies providing significant time and financial savings. This symposium is a fantastic opportunity for experts in the academic and pharmaceutical development fields to come together to promote growth and education regarding recent advancements in the pre-clinical arena.  He continued;  We hope that conferences such as this one will allow for those working at the forefront of oncology research and development to pool their invaluable experience and knowledge of cancer drug discovery to significantly advance our understanding of the disease and how to fight it . PDX models have become increasingly relevant in drug discovery over recent years, primarily due to the severe escalation in financial costs and the constant evolution of both disease and treatment. With the discovery of ever more complex disease subtypes, pharmaceutical companies are developing correspondingly complex novel drug candidates and are experiencing greater pressure to validate their compounds before entering clinical trials. Pre-clinical screening allows developers to minimise losses on ineffective or unsafe therapeutics whilst yielding accurate predictions of performance in the clinic. PDX models are a highly cost-effective and efficient platform with which to test prospective drug candidates and offer relevant information which can then be used to make informed decisions on which candidates are promoted into the clinic.","Published: July 3, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/chemists-design-a-quantumdot-spectrometer-190479,Chemists Design a Quantum Dot Spectrometer New instrument is small enough to function within a smartphone  enabling portable light analysis  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Instruments that measure the properties of light, known as spectrometers, are widely used in physical, chemical, and biological research. These devices are usually too large to be portable, but MIT scientists have now shown they can create spectrometers small enough to fit inside a smartphone camera, using tiny semiconductor nanoparticles called quantum dots. Such devices could be used to diagnose diseases, especially skin conditions, or to detect environmental pollutants and food conditions, says Jie Bao, a former MIT postdoc and the lead author of a paper describing the quantum dot spectrometers. This work also represents a new application for quantum dots, which have been used primarily for labeling cells and biological molecules, as well as in computer and television screens.  Using quantum dots for spectrometers is such a straightforward application compared to everything else that we ve tried to do, and I think that s very appealing,  says Moungi Bawendi, the Lester Wolfe Professor of Chemistry at MIT and the paper s senior author. Shrinking spectrometers The earliest spectrometers consisted of prisms that separate light into its constituent wavelengths, while current models use optical equipment such as diffraction gratings to achieve the same effect. Spectrometers are used in a wide variety of applications, such as studying atomic processes and energy levels in physics, or analyzing tissue samples for biomedical research and diagnostics. Replacing that bulky optical equipment with quantum dots allowed the MIT team to shrink spectrometers to about the size of a U.S. quarter, and to take advantage of some of the inherent useful properties of quantum dots. Quantum dots, a type of nanocrystals discovered in the early 1980s, are made by combining metals such as lead or cadmium with other elements including sulfur, selenium, or arsenic. By controlling the ratio of these starting materials, the temperature, and the reaction time, scientists can generate a nearly unlimited number of dots with differences in an electronic property known as bandgap, which determines the wavelengths of light that each dot will absorb. However, most of the existing applications for quantum dots don t take advantage of this huge range of light absorbance. Instead, most applications, such as labeling cells or new types of TV screens, exploit quantum dots  fluorescence   a property that is much more difficult to control, Bawendi says.  It s very hard to make something that fluoresces very brightly,  he says.  You ve got to protect the dots, you ve got to do all this engineering.  Scientists are also working on solar cells based on quantum dots, which rely on the dots  ability to convert light into electrons. However, this phenomenon is not well understood, and is difficult to manipulate.  On the other hand, quantum dots  absorption properties are well known and very stable.  If we can rely on these properties, it is possible to create applications that will have a greater impact in the relative short term,  Bao says. Broad spectrum The new quantum dot spectrometer deploys hundreds of quantum dot materials that each filter a specific set of wavelengths of light. The quantum dot filters are printed into a thin film and placed on top of a photodetector such as the charge-coupled devices (CCDs) found in cellphone cameras. The researchers created an algorithm that analyzes the percentage of photons absorbed by each filter, then recombines the information from each one to calculate the intensity and wavelength of the original rays of light. The more quantum dot materials there are, the more wavelengths can be covered and the higher resolution can be obtained. In this case, the researchers used about 200 types of quantum dots spread over a range of about 300 nanometers. With more dots, such spectrometers could be designed to cover an even wider range of light frequencies.  Bawendi and Bao showed a beautiful way to exploit the controlled optical absorption of semiconductor quantum dots for miniature spectrometers. They demonstrate a spectrometer that is not only small, but also with high throughput and high spectral resolution, which has never been achieved before,  says Feng Wang, an associate professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley who was not involved in the research. If incorporated into small handheld devices, this type of spectrometer could be used to diagnose skin conditions or analyze urine samples, Bao says. They could also be used to track vital signs such as pulse and oxygen level, or to measure exposure to different frequencies of ultraviolet light, which vary greatly in their ability to damage skin.  The central component of such spectrometers   the quantum dot filter array   is fabricated with solution-based processing and printing, thus enabling significant potential cost reduction,  Bao adds.","Published: July 3, 2015"

The research team included scientists from Penn State University, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the University of Chicago. ""This project represents a departure from previous efforts to study ancient genomes,"" said Webb Miller, project co-leader and professor of biology and of computer science and engineering at Penn State. ""We've sequenced and analyzed a number of genomes, including several from extinct species, but before this project, we limited ourselves to purely computational analyses. However, our dissatisfaction with those types of studies increased over time as we observed a wide disparity in published predictions. We therefore refined our strategy for the current project by focusing on computational predictions that can be experimentally validated."" Project co-leader Stephan Schuster, formerly of Penn State and now at the Nanyang Technological University, said, ""I've been trying for a long time to show that ancient genomes can be sequenced as accurately as extant genomes, and the woolly mammoth seemed like an ideal species for demonstrating this capability. The Asian elephant genomes were needed for comparison in the subsequent analyses."" The two woolly mammoths sequenced by the team died about 20,000 and 60,000 years ago, respectively. To weed out errors that could have resulted from the sequencing process or the age of the genetic material recovered from the mammoths, and to ensure the quality of the genetic data, the researchers read each letter in the mammoth's genomic alphabet an average of twenty times. They then compared the genomic sequence of the mammoths to the newly-sequenced genomes of the three Asian elephants and to the genome of the more distantly related African elephant. The research team found a total of approximately 33 million places in the genomes where the letters, known as nucleotides, varied among the three species. Of particular interest to understanding mammoth-specific biology were 1.4 million genetic variants in which the two mammoths were identical for one variant and the Asian and African elephants shared a different, likely more-ancient variant. Of these ""shared, derived"" variants, the scientists identified 2,020 that resulted in a change to the amino-acid sequence of a protein encoded by a gene and 26 that caused the loss of a gene's function. They also identified one newly duplicated gene in the mammoths. ""The collection of 2,020 amino-acid variants that we discovered in mammoths, but that our analysis showed are not present in living elephants, represents a treasure trove that can be mined for the genetic causes of mammoth-specific characteristics and whose functions can be tested in further experiments,"" said Miller. ""We used very strict conditions to keep the accuracy high, since computation is inexpensive but experiments are costly. There is no doubt that many more mammoth-specific variants are waiting to be discovered."" Of the amino-acid variants shared between the two mammoths, but not found in the living elephants, the research team found a disproportionate number of changes in genes involved in hair development, how the body stores and processes fats, and how the body senses temperature. ""It is gratifying that the strongly enriched classes of genes include many of those related to the adaptation of the woolly mammoth to extreme cold,"" said Vincent J. Lynch of the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, the first author of the paper. The researchers then performed laboratory experiments verifying a computational prediction that a mammoth-specific change in a protein called TRPV3, known to be related to temperature sensation, hair growth, and body-fat storage, modifies the protein's response to temperature changes. ""Identifying the genetic changes that underlie evolution of physical traits is challenging, particularly in non-model and extinct organisms,"" said Lynch. ""Current methods make it relatively straightforward to sequence and computationally analyze genomes. However, predicting function from computational analysis alone is still incredibly difficult and unreliable. What's needed is laboratory confirmation of those predictions, which is where the challenge lies. Our paper shows how it can be done.""","Published: July 3, 2015"

The lead authors of the four papers are Luana Fioriti, Joseph Stephan, Luca Colnaghi and Bettina Drisaldi. When long-term memories are created in the brain, new connections are made between neurons to store the memory. But those physical connections must be maintained for a memory to persist, or else they will disintegrate and the memory will disappear within days. Many researchers have searched for molecules that maintain long-term memory, but their identity has remained elusive. These memory molecules are a normal version of prion proteins, according to research led by Nobel laureate Eric Kandel, MD, who is University Professor & Kavli Professor of Brain Science, co-director of Columbia s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, director of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science, and senior investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, at CUMC. Prions derived from the words protein infectious particles are a unique class of proteins. Unlike other proteins, they are not only able to self-propagate but also to induce other proteins to take on their alternative shape. When prions form in a cell, notably in a neuron, they cause damage by grouping together in sticky aggregates that disrupt cellular processes. Prion aggregates are highly stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. The dying cell releases the prion proteins, which are then taken up by other cells   and are thus considered infectious. These abnormal proteins are known to cause mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). They also have been linked to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer s, Parkinson s, and Huntington s. In contrast, functional prion proteins can play a physiological role in the cell and do not contribute to disease. Kausik Si and Dr. Kandel first identified functional prions in the giant sea slug (Aplysia) and found they contribute to the maintenance of memory storage. More recently, the Kandel laboratory searched for and found a similar protein in mice, called CPEB3. In one of many experiments described in the paper by Luana Fioriti, the researchers challenged mice to repeatedly navigate a maze, allowing the animals to create a long-term memory. But when the researchers knocked out the animal s CPEB3 gene two weeks after the memory was made, the memory disappeared. The researchers then discovered how CPEB3 works inside the neurons to maintain long-term memories.  Like disease-causing prions, functional prions come in two varieties, a soluble form and a form that creates aggregates,  said. Kandel.  When we learn something and form long-term memories, new synaptic connections are made, the soluble prions in those synapses are converted into aggregated prions. The aggregated prions turn on protein synthesis necessary to maintain the memory.  As long as these aggregates are present, Kandel says, long-term memories persist. Prion aggregates renew themselves by continually recruiting newly made soluble prions into the aggregates.  This ongoing maintenance is crucial,  said Dr. Kandel.  It s how you remember, for example, your first love for the rest of your life.  A similar protein exists in humans, suggesting that the same mechanism is at work in the human brain, but more research is needed.  It s possible that it has the same role in memory, but until this has been examined, we won t know,  said Dr. Kandel.  There are probably other regulatory components involved,  he added.  Long-term memory is a complicated process, so I doubt this is the only important factor.","Published: July 3, 2015"

""This technology can actively stabilize two items relative to each other with a precision well below one nanometer at room temperature,"" JILA/NIST physicist Tom Perkins says. ""This level of 3D stability may start to interest the nanomanufacturing world, when they look at making and characterizing things on the single-nanometer scale.""JILA instrument for accurately tracking microscopic objects such as DNA molecules for many hours is pictured. The microscope is on the left. The sample is mounted on the black block on top of the silver stage. The lasers and optics are on the right. Credit: Burrows/JILA. The work builds on JILA's world-leading expertise in measuring positions of microscopic objects. The latest tweaks extend stability for a much longer time period, many hours at a time. With the longer observation times, researchers can see more successive steps of molecular motors, for instance. These biochemical processes are responsible for a broad range of movement in living organisms, including moving molecules around the interior of a cell or copying DNA into another form of genetic material, RNA. The new JILA instrument also can aid in measuring individual proteins as they fold into specific positions, a process required for them to work properly. Until now, researchers had difficulty detecting more than a few individual, one-base-pair steps in succession before instrumental ""drift"" would blur the signal. Observing such sets of repetitive steps is very rare. The instrument must be stable to within about one-tenth of a nanometer (1 angstrom to biologists, equivalent to the diameter of a hydrogen atom). Typically, a microscope can only occasionally achieve this level of stability. But when augmented by the new JILA measurement platform, it can reliably achieve tenth of a nanometer stability for up to 100 seconds at a time. And it can do this over and over again for extended periods--the JILA team operated the system for up to 28 hours straight. In addition to its high precision and stability, the instrument can detect motion over a wide range of time scales, critical for calibrating instruments and measuring short-lived states in protein folding. The JILA method can be applied to optical trapping techniques, atomic force microscopes and super-resolution imaging. The method uses two lasers to measure the positions of opposite ends of a molecule, or two different objects, based on the intensity of scattered light. The scattered light is detected by a common photodiode, and the signals are digitized, analyzed and used to calculate the positions of the samples. Crucially, the JILA team verified the stability of the technique by using the two lasers to make two separate, independent measurements of a single sample. Without this confirmation, researchers can't determine if it is the sample or the lasers moving, Perkins explains. ""This technology excites me because it opens the door to measuring the tiniest protein motions,"" Perkins says.""","Published: July 3, 2015"

You did yesterday, and you will again tomorrow.  By bedtime every night, you re likely to be about an inch shorter than when you got up. But assuming you sleep lying down, each evening s rest restores you to full height.  The spongy discs between each vertebra lose fluid from the forces that bear down on them during the day. They become thinner and stiffer. In a healthy back, discs reabsorb the fluid when the body goes horizontal for the night.  Herniated discs don t bounce back. When disc tissue squeezes out of the space, they lose some of their shock absorbing capacity and impinge on spinal nerves, triggering lower back and leg pain. Herniated discs and severe disc degeneration inevitably change the biomechanical forces on tissues and structures in and near the back.  But how damaged discs alter the body s biomechanics remains largely unknown. Even the mechanical stresses caused by treating herniated disc disease is poorly understood.  Understanding the biomechanics of healthy and damaged discs could lead to new  treatments that reduce physical stress. Insights might reduce the need to cut out disc material or fuse vertebrae in many patients. Farther down the line, but already under study at UC Berkeley, new disc tissue could be grown   engineered in the lab to replace deteriorated discs. Some 20 years of research has taken this futuristic-sounding prospect into the first clinical trials for repairing or replacing damaged cartilage.  UC Berkeley s Grace O Connell has been at the heart of this research since graduate school. Now in her second year as assistant professor of mechanical engineering, she is adapting the technology with the aim of growing new human disc tissue.  Source material comes from donated disc tissue excised during back surgeries at UC Davis Medical Center, posing an initial problem.  The tissue comes from an already-compromised environment   serious disc damage that required surgery,  she says.  Starting with unhealthy disc tissue requires more culture time in the lab to  reprogram  cells to produce new tissues.  The lab made initial progress with an animal model   disc material from cow tails supplied by butchers. Refining key steps in this process will likely help make the transition from animal to human disc tissue engineering.  How do you grow new, living tissue in the lab? First the bovine disc material is digested with an enzyme and the disc cells are separated out. They are mixed into a soft, transparent algae based-gel, meant to mimic the spongy environment of normal discs and provide a  scaffold  on which the new cells can grow.   The gel is key.  O Connell s postdoc research focused on developing a gel scaffold for growing cartilage. Though cartilage is similar to disc tissue, it is stiffer and does not swell during bed rest like disc tissue. O Connell s lab uses softer, more pliable gel and culture conditions designed to increase swelling capabilities of engineered disc tissues.  The cells are supplied with nutrients the body normally provides during development. O Connell casts the gel containing the cells into sheets, and then uses a  biopsy punch  to create four-millimeter-diameter cylinders of gel and cells in which the cells grow new tissue.  After four to six weeks, each cylinder contains about 800,000 cultured cells embedded in and supported by the gel, with properties comparable to native tissue.  Clinical application of this technology will require much larger engineered tissues, O Connell says. Berkeley s Rose Hill Innovator Award is providing funding for three years to help her scale up the pioneering effort and to develop tissues that better mimic the anatomy of the human joint.  O Connell hopes that  in the next three years we will be able to demonstrate that this technology can be used as a biological repair strategy for herniated discs, and gain NIH support to advance it.

About 200,000 of them are under 20 years old. The condition arises when a person s own immune system destroys the pancreas cells that make insulin, the hormone that converts blood sugar into energy. To make up for this loss of insulin production, patients must take insulin daily. Current delivery methods involve multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy, both requiring the user to actively track glucose and calculate the needed insulin dose. There is also a significant time lag between when a dose is needed and when it can take effect. Francis J. Doyle III and colleagues wanted to find a way to make monitoring and insulin delivery automatic and needle-free. The researchers designed an algorithm that monitors blood sugar levels and computes an insulin dose that it delivers quickly and automatically when necessary. The algorithm is designed to work with implanted devices, specifically with an artificial pancreas, and would overcome the delays experienced with current devices. Computer testing of the algorithm simulated the rise and fall of glucose that would correspond to meals and an overnight period of sleep. The artificial pancreas maintained blood glucose within the target range nearly 80 percent of the time. The researchers say they will soon test the device in animals.","Published: July 3, 2015"

These cells, called microglia, often play a beneficial role by helping to clear trash and protect the central nervous system against infection. But a new study by researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI) shows that they also accelerate damage wrought by blinding eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa. NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.  These findings are important because they suggest that microglia may provide a target for entirely new therapeutic strategies aimed at halting blinding eye diseases of the retina,  said NEI Director, Paul A. Sieving, M.D.  New targets create untapped opportunities for preventing disease-related damage to the eye, and preserving vision for as long as possible.  The findings were published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine. Retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disorder that affects roughly 1 in 4,000 people, damages the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Research has shown links between retinitis pigmentosa and several mutations in genes for photoreceptors, the cells in the retina that convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. In the early stages of the disease, rod photoreceptors, which enable us to see in low light, are lost, causing night blindness. As the disease progresses, cone photoreceptors, which are needed for sharp vision and seeing colors, can also die off, eventually leading to complete blindness. Lead investigator, Wai T. Wong M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Unit on Neuron-Glia Interactions in Retinal Disease at NEI, and his team studied mice with a mutation in a gene that can also cause retinitis pigmentosa in people. The researchers observed in these mice that very early in the disease process, the microglia infiltrate a layer of the retina near the photoreceptors, called the outer nuclear layer, where they don t usually venture. The microglia then create a cup-like structure over a single photoreceptor, surrounding it to ingest it in a process called phagocytosis. Wong and his team caught this dynamic process on video. The whole feast, including digestion, takes about an hour. Phagocytosis is a normal process in healthy tissues and is a key way of clearing away dead cells and cellular debris. However, in retinitis pigmentosa the researchers found that the microglia target damaged but living photoreceptors, in addition to dead ones. To confirm that microglia contribute to the degeneration process, the researchers genetically eliminated the microglia, which slowed the rate of rod photoreceptor death and the loss of visual function in the mice. Inhibiting phagocytosis with a compound had a similar effect. The microglia seem to ignore cone photoreceptors, which fits with the known early course of retinitis pigmentosa.  These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit microglial activation may help decelerate the rate of rod photoreceptor degeneration and preserve vision,  Wong said. What triggers microglia to go on this destructive feeding frenzy? Wong and colleagues found evidence that photoreceptors carrying mutations undergo physiological stress. The stress then triggers them to secrete chemicals dubbed  find me  signals, which is like ringing a dinner bell that attracts microglia into the retinal layer. Once there, the microglia probe the photoreceptors repeatedly, exposing themselves to  eat me  signals, which then trigger phagocytosis. In response to all the feasting, the microglia become activated. That is, they send out their own signals to call other microglia to the scene and they release substances that promote inflammation. Other potential treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, such as gene therapy, are progressing, but are not without challenges. Gene therapy requires replacing defective genes with functional genes, yet more than 50 distinct genes have been linked to the disease in different families, so there s no one-size-fits-all gene therapy. A therapy targeting microglia might complement gene therapy because it s an approach that s independent of the specific genetic cause of retinitis pigmentosa, said Wong. A clinical trial (NCT02140164) is already underway at NEI to see if the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline can block the activation of microglia and help slow the progression of retinitis pigmentosa. The trial is currently recruiting participants.","Published: July 3, 2015"

The clinical trial reached its primary endpoint with patients who received therapy having a significant, if modest benefit in lung function compared with those receiving a placebo. Patients from across England and Scotland participated, and were treated in two centres, Royal Brompton Hospital in London and the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. The trial is the first to show that repeated doses of gene therapy can have a meaningful effect on the disease, and change the lung function of patients. However, the team say more research is needed to improve the effectiveness before the therapy will be suitable for clinical use. The study was carried out by the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium, a group of scientists and clinical teams from Imperial College London, the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and NHS Lothian who came together in 2001 to develop a gene therapy, supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.  The current trial was launched in 2012 and funded by a partnership between the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The findings are published today in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the commonest lethal inherited disease in the UK, affecting around 10,000 people nationally and over 90,000 worldwide. Patients' lungs become filled with thick sticky mucus and they are vulnerable to recurrent chest infections, which eventually destroy the lungs.  The cause of CF, mutations in a gene located on chromosome 7, was identified in 1989, opening the door to introducing a normal copy of this gene using gene therapy. In the trial, patients were treated by inhaling molecules of DNA wrapped in fat globules (liposomes) that deliver the gene into the cells in the lung lining.  Professor Eric Alton, the coordinator of the Consortium from Imperial College London, who is also a consultant physician at Royal Brompton Hospital, said: ""Patients who received the gene therapy showed a significant, if modest, benefit in tests of lung function compared with the placebo group; there were no safety concerns. Whilst the effect was inconsistent, with some patients responding better than others, the results are encouraging, laying the groundwork for further trials which we hope could improve the effect.  ""We are looking to undertake follow-up studies assessing higher, more frequent doses as well as combinations with other treatments. The programme of work came about through the generosity of the CF community via the CF Trust, whilst the trial exemplifies how effectively the MRC and NIHR, working in partnership, are able to move laboratory science into patient benefit. Publication of this trial is a landmark for CF patients and we are particularly grateful to the many patients across the UK who gave their time and effort to participate and make this collaborative venture a success."" Minister for Life Sciences, George Freeman said: ""Cystic Fibrosis can have a devastating effect on patients and families and this is an excellent development for people living with the condition. The government is absolutely committed to supporting new medical treatments and invests  1bn a year in health research. It is vital we are at the forefront of turning scientific discoveries into tangible benefits and affordable treatments for NHS patients."" Imperial Innovations, Imperial's technology commercialisation company, is acting as the lead technology transfer office for the consortium. Innovations holds a family of patents and orphan drug designation for the treatment, and is seeking commercial partners who can support its further clinical development. The consortium is developing a second therapy that uses a virus to deliver the DNA into cells. They are aiming to begin the first clinical trial of this treatment in 2016. ""Our aim is to achieve a step change in the treatment of CF that focuses on the basic defect rather than just addressing the symptoms. It has taken more than 20 years to get where we are now, and there is still some way to go. Eventually we hope gene therapy will push CF patients towards a normal life expectancy and improve their quality of life significantly,"" said Professor Alton. Ed Owen, Chief Executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said: ""We are committed to improving and transforming the lives of people with cystic fibrosis, and the results of this pioneering clinical trial are a promising development. Further clinical research is now needed before we can say that it is a viable clinical therapy but it is encouraging that a proof of concept has been established.  ""The Gene Therapy Consortium (GTC) has been supported by the cystic fibrosis community for many years and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is proud to have funded the initial programmes that led to this trial. We have also committed a further  500,000 over the next two years to support the infrastructure of the consortium and to allow further development of its longer-term work to develop a viral vector gene therapy. ""This is an extraordinary time for therapeutic development in cystic fibrosis and the need is urgent to stop so many young lives being cut short because of this cruel condition.  We will therefore continue to invest in innovative genetic research and to work with academic and industry partners to develop advancements which will make further progress towards our goal of a life unlimited by cystic fibrosis.""","Published: July 3, 2015"

And paradoxically, it works in the same way as mechanisms that cause mad cow disease, kuru, and other degenerative brain diseases. In four papers published in Neuron and Cell Reports, Dr. Kandel's laboratory show how prion-like proteins -- similar to the prions behind mad cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in humans -- are critical for maintaining long-term memories in mice, and probably in other mammals. The lead authors of the four papers are Luana Fioriti, Joseph Stephan, Luca Colnaghi and Bettina Drisaldi. When long-term memories are created in the brain, new connections are made between neurons to store the memory. But those physical connections must be maintained for a memory to persist, or else they will disintegrate and the memory will disappear within days. Many researchers have searched for molecules that maintain long-term memory, but their identity has remained elusive. These memory molecules are a normal version of prion proteins, according to research led by Nobel laureate Eric Kandel, MD, who is University Professor & Kavli Professor of Brain Science, co-director of Columbia's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, director of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science, and senior investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, at CUMC. Prions--derived from the words protein infectious particles--are a unique class of proteins. Unlike other proteins, they are not only able to self-propagate but also to induce other proteins to take on their alternative shape. When prions form in a cell, notably in a neuron, they cause damage by grouping together in sticky aggregates that disrupt cellular processes. Prion aggregates are highly stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. The dying cell releases the prion proteins, which are then taken up by other cells -- and are thus considered infectious. These abnormal proteins are known to cause mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). They also have been linked to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. In contrast, functional prion proteins can play a physiological role in the cell and do not contribute to disease. Kausik Si and Dr. Kandel first identified functional prions in the giant sea slug (Aplysia) and found they contribute to the maintenance of memory storage. More recently, the Kandel laboratory searched for and found a similar protein in mice, called CPEB3. In one of many experiments described in the paper by Luana Fioriti, the researchers challenged mice to repeatedly navigate a maze, allowing the animals to create a long-term memory. But when the researchers knocked out the animal's CPEB3 gene two weeks after the memory was made, the memory disappeared. The researchers then discovered how CPEB3 works inside the neurons to maintain long-term memories. ""Like disease-causing prions, functional prions come in two varieties, a soluble form and a form that creates aggregates,"" said. Kandel. ""When we learn something and form long-term memories, new synaptic connections are made, the soluble prions in those synapses are converted into aggregated prions. The aggregated prions turn on protein synthesis necessary to maintain the memory."" As long as these aggregates are present, Kandel says, long-term memories persist. Prion aggregates renew themselves by continually recruiting newly made soluble prions into the aggregates. ""This ongoing maintenance is crucial,"" said Dr. Kandel. ""It's how you remember, for example, your first love for the rest of your life."" A similar protein exists in humans, suggesting that the same mechanism is at work in the human brain, but more research is needed. ""It's possible that it has the same role in memory, but until this has been examined, we won't know,"" said Dr. Kandel. ""There are probably other regulatory components involved,"" he added. ""Long-term memory is a complicated process, so I doubt this is the only important factor. Columbia University Medical Center   press release Kandel ER et al.

New University College London (UCL) research funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust has now revealed how this might happen in the brain. The study, published in Nature Communications, shows that when someone tries to remember one aspect of an event, such as who they met yesterday, the representation of the entire event can be reactivated in the brain, including incidental information such as where they were and what they did.  When we recall a previous life event, we have the ability to re-immerse ourselves in the experience,  explains lead author Dr. Aidan Horner (UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience & Institute of Neurology).  We remember the room we were in, the music that was playing, the person we were talking to and what they were saying. When we first experience the event, all these distinct aspects are represented in different regions of the brain, yet we are still able to remember them all later on. It is the hippocampus that is critical to this process, associating all these different aspects so that the entire event can be retrieved.  The researchers showed that associations formed between the different aspects of an event allow one aspect to retrieve all the other aspects, a process known as  pattern completion . For example, when remembering who we saw, we often remember other details such as what they were holding and where they were. This means that the entire event can be re-experienced in full. Using fMRI, the researchers showed that different aspects of an imagined event are reflected in activity in different regions of the brain. When asked about one aspect of an event, activity in the hippocampus correlates with reactivation in these regions, including those incidental to the task, and that this reactivation corresponds to the full event coming to mind.  This work supports a long-standing computational model of how memory might work, in which the hippocampus enables different types of information to be bound together so that they can be imagined as a coherent event when we want to remember what happened,  says senior author Professor Neil Burgess.  It provides a fundamental insight into our ability to recollect what has happened, and may help to understand how this process can go wrong in conditions such as Alzheimer s disease or post-traumatic stress disorder.  The experiment involved 26 volunteers, who were asked to imagine and memorize a series of  events  involving different locations, famous people and objects. They were then asked to remember the details of the event based on a single cue. For example, one trial  event  involved U.S. President Barack Obama in a kitchen with a hammer. Volunteers were then asked to remember details based on a single cue, such as  where was Obama? ,  who was in the kitchen?  or  what object did Obama have? . When asked to recall different aspects of events, volunteers underwent fMRI scans to measure their brain activity. The results showed that different parts of the brain showed increased activity when encoding different aspects of each event, and that the hippocampus provides the critical links between them to form a complete memory. Using the previous example, activity increased in one part of the brain when volunteers thought of Obama, another when they thought of the kitchen and another when they thought of the hammer. The study showed that when asked  where was Obama?  activity increased in the regions corresponding to Obama and Kitchen. Critically, activity also increased in the region corresponding to the hammer, despite no requirement to retrieve this item. This  reactivation  correlated with hippocampal activity, suggesting the hippocampus is involved in retrieving the entire event. The research is the first to provide evidence for this pattern completion process in the human hippocampus, and relate this to the everyday experience of recalling previous life events.

The new research is part of the ongoing Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS), which began in 2010 to better understand how interactions between the brain, genome and environment shape risky behaviors that can predict mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, and addiction. ""By knowing the biology that predicts risk, we hope to eventually change the biology -- or at least meet that biology with other forces to stem the risk,"" said the senior author of both studies, Ahmad Hariri, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. In both studies, the team used non-invasive functional MRI imaging to measure the activity of two brain areas that help shape opposing behaviors crucial for survival: the reward-seeking ventral striatum and the threat-assessing amygdala. In a 2012 sample of 200 DNS participants, Hariri's group showed that having both an overactive ventral striatum and an underactive amygdala was associated with problem drinking in response to stress. Hariri's team confirmed this finding in the new study using a larger sample of 759 undergraduate students who averaged 19 years old. The researchers also discovered that the inverse brain pattern -- low ventral striatum and high amygdala activity -- predicted problem drinking in response to stress both at the time of the scan and three months after. These results were published June 30 in Molecular Psychiatry. ""We now have these two distinct profiles of risk that, in general, reflect imbalance in the function of typically complementary brain areas,"" Hariri said. ""If you have high activity in both areas, no problem. If you have low activity in both areas, no problem. It's when they're out of whack that individuals may have problems with drinking."" Interestingly, people with the two different risk profiles may drink for different reasons. Hariri speculates that those with high ventral striatum activity may be motivated to drink because they are impulsive; combined with a lower danger signal coming from the amygdala, they may be less inclined to reign in their behavior. In contrast, the participants with low ventral striatum activity usually have lower mood, and an overactive amygdala may make them more sensitive to stress, so they might drink as a coping mechanism. Balance in the activity of the ventral striatum and the amygdala also predicts sexual behavior, according to the second study, which appeared June 10 in the Journal of Neuroscience. In that study, a team led by graduate student Elizabeth Victor asked a subset of DNS participants (70 heterosexual men and women) how many new sexual partners they acquired over an 11-month period. For men, the same pattern of brain activity linked to problem drinking -- high ventral striatum and low amygdala activity -- was associated with a greater number of sexual partners compared to those men with more balanced activity of the two brain areas. But the pattern for more sexually active women was different: they had higher-than-normal activity in both the ventral striatum and the amygdala -- indicating both high reward and high threat. ""It's not really clear why that is,"" Hariri said. ""One possibility is that this amygdala signal is representing different things in men and women."" In women, amygdala activity might be driving general awareness, arousal, and responsiveness which, when combined with strong reward-related activity in the ventral striatum, leads to a greater number of partners. In contrast, in men, the amygdala signal could be more focused on detecting danger, Hariri said. Measuring brain-based predictors of sexual behavior is largely uncharted territory, Victor said. Although a previous study tied higher ventral striatum activity to more sexual partners, no prior studies have accounted for amygdala activity. The next step to examine both risky sex and problem drinking is to add a third brain region: the prefrontal cortex, which is the brain's ultimate decision-maker. This part of the brain may help the researchers predict more accurately which individuals may engage in risky behaviors. Developing brain-based predictors is important because individuals aren't necessarily aware of their risks, Hariri said, nor are their doctors. ""The key is that these are patterns present before problems emerge,"" especially in response to stress, Hariri said.

The research, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, found that female mice exposed to male pheromones gave birth to infants with greater mental ability. ""This is the first study to show that pheromone exposure exerts an influence across generations in mammals,"" said Sachiko Koyama, an associate research scientist at the IU Bloomington Medical Sciences Program and visiting scientist at the IU College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. ""We found that male pheromones seem to influence the nutritional environment following birth, resulting in changes to the brain that could extend to future generations,"" she added. Pheromones are chemical signals used to communicate between organisms of the same species. The connection between male pheromones and offspring s brain development seems to stem from the influence of male pheromones on the nursing ability of mother mice. Specifically, IU scientists measured greater mammary gland development in mice exposed to male pheromones a week after exposure, which may have led to greater volumes or improved quality of milk production. These mother mice also showed lengthier nursing periods compared to mice not exposed to the male pheromone. To measure the intelligence of the offspring, IU scientists placed mice in a water maze with a hidden platform. The mice born of mothers exposed to male pheromones learned the location of the hidden platform much faster, suggesting quicker learning and stronger spatial memory compared to the control group. These improvements in brain development and cognitive function may stem from specific  neuro-enhancing  chemicals in breast milk, such as sialic acid, a component of breast milk also found at high levels in the brain during early development. IU researchers found higher levels of polysialyltransferase -- an enzyme that requires sialic acid to produce a molecule involved in neural cell development -- in the brains of the offspring of female mice exposed to male pheromones compared to the control group. A synthetic version of the male mouse pheromone 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole, or  SBT,  was used in the study. The chemical was discovered at the Institute for Pheromone Research in the IU Department of Chemistry, directed by Milos Novotny, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Chemistry and Lilly Chemistry Alumni Chair in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences. Novotny s lab pioneered research on pheromones in mammals during the 1980s at IU, identifying the chemical structures and determining the biological effects of these pheromones in mice, and later in several other mammalian species. Previously, scientists regarded pheromones as limited to the world of insects. ""This publication represents an important addition to the field of animal communication and the effects of mammalian pheromones,"" Novotny said. ""It shows that the effect of the male mouse pheromone SBT not only transmits an important olfactory message to the recipient females but, through some as-yet-unknown molecular signaling mechanisms, brings apparent benefits to their offspring."" Previous pheromone research has primarily focused on the influence of chemicals on animals within the same generational group, such as on mating behaviors, including the ability to suppress or encourage mammalian mating activity, as well as to attract females or stimulate aggression in males. The power of scents has also been shown in humans through research showing that women who spend a long time together synchronize menstrual cycles. By focusing on pheromone effects across generations, Koyama said the new IU study contributes to the growing field of epigenetics, which studies the influence of the environment on genetics, such as when nutrition creates changes in the body that may be passed on to the next generation. ""If we can find the specific milk 'ingredients' that affect cognitive function in the offspring, for example, we may eventually be able to use them as supplements to enhance brain development,"" she said. For their next steps, the IU team plans to conduct a more complete chemical analysis of the milk of the mother mice, as well as to track the mental development of their offspring across future generations.

Effective data usage is currently hindered by a lack of effective descriptions for those data, and an inconsistency across a vast number of tools and services regarding how data is accessed, formatted and cited. By addressing these disparities and enhancing interoperability between public repositories and analytical services, COPO will improve transparency and reproducibility in the plant sciences, helping to facilitate high-quality research.The two-day workshop was designed to gain greater insight into the types of experiments that biologists are undertaking across a broad set of plant science domains, how datasets are being generated, and the needs of the researchers that use them. This crucial information will be used to guide the creation of a COPO community platform for data sharing, publication and citation. Over the course of the workshop, the focus group discussed various issues including divergent approaches to the description, collection, annotation, standardisation and management of large datasets. The group examined features of various platforms used within plant science data management and spoke with researchers from different plant science fields to gain an overview of their current requirements and how to avoid and surmount the stumbling blocks when publishing their data. Robert Davey, Group Leader and COPO PI at TGAC, said:  From the experiences of the workshop participants, it's clear that there are common issues around describing data and making it available to other researchers. Through the technical expertise of the ISA group at Oxford, the EBI, and TGAC, and the essential interactions with the community provided through Warwick and GARNet, we aim to provide plant biologists and bioinformaticians with an intuitive platform to annotate their data with experimental metadata, submit to relevant public repositories, and enable effective downstream data sharing and analysis.  Ruth Bastow, GARNet Coordinator, University of Warwick, commented:  The workshop illustrated that there is huge amount and variety of data being produced in the plant sciences. However, there are often problems accessing this data and perhaps more importantly making sense of it. To try help overcome these barriers COPO aims to help researchers describe their experiments, methods and data in a standard manner to promote data sharing and reuse.  Philippe Rocca-Serra, University of Oxford e-Research Centre, added:  We brought together leading experts from an array of domains in plant sciences, analytical techniques and computational biology. All participants engaged enthusiastically in the workshop on the theme of how to improve data stewardship, data access and data publication in the field of plant science. The results and outcomes of the meeting are extremely positive, as patterns have emerged, which we intend to harness for developing the COPO platform. We all look forward to continuing the conversation. ","Published: July 2, 2015"

These cells, called microglia, often play a beneficial role by helping to clear trash and protect the central nervous system against infection. But a new study by researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI) shows that they also accelerate damage wrought by blinding eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa. NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.  These findings are important because they suggest that microglia may provide a target for entirely new therapeutic strategies aimed at halting blinding eye diseases of the retina,  said NEI Director, Paul A. Sieving, M.D.  New targets create untapped opportunities for preventing disease-related damage to the eye, and preserving vision for as long as possible. A microglial cell (green) extends spider-like arms to capture and consume rod photoreceptor cells (blue). Credit: Dr. Wai Wong, NEI. Retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disorder that affects roughly 1 in 4,000 people, damages the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Research has shown links between retinitis pigmentosa and several mutations in genes for photoreceptors, the cells in the retina that convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. In the early stages of the disease, rod photoreceptors, which enable us to see in low light, are lost, causing night blindness.  As the disease progresses, cone photoreceptors, which are needed for sharp vision and seeing colors, can also die off, eventually leading to complete blindness. Lead investigator, Wai T. Wong M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Unit on Neuron-Glia Interactions in Retinal Disease at NEI, and his team studied mice with a mutation in a gene that can also cause retinitis pigmentosa in people. The researchers observed in these mice that very early in the disease process, the microglia infiltrate a layer of the retina near the photoreceptors, called the outer nuclear layer, where they don t usually venture.  The microglia then create a cup-like structure over a single photoreceptor, surrounding it to ingest it in a process called phagocytosis. Wong and his team caught this dynamic process on video. The whole feast, including digestion, takes about an hour. Phagocytosis is a normal process in healthy tissues and is a key way of clearing away dead cells and cellular debris. However, in retinitis pigmentosa the researchers found that the microglia target damaged but living photoreceptors, in addition to dead ones. To confirm that microglia contribute to the degeneration process, the researchers genetically eliminated the microglia, which slowed the rate of rod photoreceptor death and the loss of visual function in the mice. Inhibiting phagocytosis with a compound had a similar effect. The microglia seem to ignore cone photoreceptors, which fits with the known early course of retinitis pigmentosa.  These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies that inhibit microglial activation may help decelerate the rate of rod photoreceptor degeneration and preserve vision,  Wong said. What triggers microglia to go on this destructive feeding frenzy? Wong and colleagues found evidence that photoreceptors carrying mutations undergo physiological stress.  The stress then triggers them to secrete chemicals dubbed  find me  signals, which is like ringing a dinner bell that attracts microglia into the retinal layer. Once there, the microglia probe the photoreceptors repeatedly, exposing themselves to  eat me  signals, which then trigger phagocytosis. In response to all the feasting, the microglia become activated. That is, they send out their own signals to call other microglia to the scene and they release substances that promote inflammation. Other potential treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, such as gene therapy, are progressing, but are not without challenges. Gene therapy requires replacing defective genes with functional genes, yet more than 50 distinct genes have been linked to the disease in different families, so there s no one-size-fits-all gene therapy. A therapy targeting microglia might complement gene therapy because it s an approach that s independent of the specific genetic cause of retinitis pigmentosa, said Wong.","Published: July 2, 2015"

But new research led by University of Pennsylvania scientists suggests that mutations in an X chromosome gene called TEX11 are responsible for a significant number of cases of infertility -- an estimated 1 percent of cases of non-obstructive azoospermia. The study has its roots 15 years ago, when Wang and colleagues cloned the Tex11 gene and found that it was specific to germ cells and was located on the X chromosome. In 2008, his group published a study showing that disrupting Tex11 function caused sterility in male mice and caused female mice to have smaller litters. This disruption halts the maturation of germ cells by interfering with meiosis, the process by which an individual's genetic material is divided and sorted into what eventually becomes eggs and sperm. To further extend these findings' implications for humans, Wang's team screened genomic samples from 246 men with azoospermia as well as others to serve as controls, looking for variations in the TEX11 gene. They found more variants in men with azoospermia than in the controls, hinting that the protein plays a key role in sperm development in humans. Though it can be difficult to create pedigrees of infertility for the very reason that men with the condition cannot have children, the researchers did find a person carrying a mutation in the TEX11 gene who had a compelling family history. Both he and his brother were azoospermic, and a genetic sample from his mother showed that she was heterozygous for the TEX11 mutation. Both of his maternal uncles were childless, though the researchers didn't have their genetic material to confirm they had the same mutation. But the pattern is indicative of a trait passed down the maternal line on the X chromosome, inherited from the mother. ""Because these two maternal uncles are sterile, ultimately, we believe that it traces back to the individual's grandmother,"" Wang said. To experimentally test whether the mutations that were identified in infertile men were the reason for their azoospermia, the research team selected three mutations found in the azoospermic men but not in the controls. They then engineered mice with versions of Tex11 that bear those same mutations and experimentally bred mice to express those mutated versions. For two of these mutations, they saw little effect. But the third had striking effects: males with this variant had significantly lower sperm counts than control animals. In addition, these mice had abnormalities in meiosis. In total, from the screening of 275 men, researchers found three mutations in TEX11 that appeared to be the cause of the infertility, resulting in a rate of about 1 percent of cases of azoospermia. ""Given that there are hundreds of candidate genes for male infertility,"" Wang said, ""1 percent is actually very significant."" As a trend toward personalized medicine means that more people can have portions or the entirety of their genome sequenced, these results have implications for genetic counselling for infertility. ""If men had one of these same mutations in this gene, I think we could safely say that's the cause of their infertility,"" Wang said.","Published: July 2, 2015"

The scientists, who employed an innovative method of targeted sequence library preparation, also discovered low-frequency fusions that had not previously been reported. The new method, which allows the simultaneous interrogation of multiple, specific genes for RNA sequencing, significantly simplifies fusion detection when compared with standard RNA sequencing approaches. Based on NuGEN s Single Primer Enrichment Technology (SPET),  This method can greatly enhance scientists  ability to understand the underlying oncogenic impact on gene regulation,  according to Elizabeth Hutt, the NuGEN CEO.  Applications based on this exciting new technology promise to speed up cancer research and lead to more effective diagnoses and treatments, contributing to the realization of precision medicine.  The scientists used the new method to prepare cancerous and normal tissue samples for targeted RNA sequencing. The goal was to detect the presence of genes that had joined together or  fused resulting in changes in gene regulation. Through NGS, the scientists were able to identify multiple known and previously unreported fusions from fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. By targeting specific RNAs for sequencing, the scientists report, they were able to reduce the number of sequencing reads and increase the sensitivity of gene fusion detection, when compared with standard RNA-Seq methods.  Traditional methods require a much larger number of sequencing reads in order to detect fusion events in a background of some 20,000 transcripts,  said Douglas Amorese, NuGEN Vice President of Research and Development.  Other focused methods cannot survey the entire repertoire of previously recognized fusions; they are limited to detection of small numbers of potential events.  Additionally, the scientists write,  The SPET-based assay is easy to use, has low RNA input requirements and can be used with RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, which is important for clinically relevant samples. The assay is fully customizable to target any gene or set of genes in any genome.  Dr. Bastiaan Tops, of the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, reported recently at a major human genetics conference that his team used a NuGEN custom gene fusion panel to analyze specific gene-rearrangements in sarcomas  and discovered two previously unknown fusions. The team, based in the Laboratory of Tumor Genetics in the University s pathology department, plans to look for those fusions in additional sarcoma samples.  Our eventual goal is to utilize such gene fusion panels in molecular diagnostic tests for sarcomas,  Tops said. The new technology is one in a suite of sample preparation products NuGEN continues to develop in light of new scientific understanding about the shared molecular mechanisms underlying cancers originating in different tissues, according to Amorese. While a tumor might appear to originate in a specific organ, the molecular mechanism or change involved may also play a role in cancers originating elsewhere. (For example, certain breast and ovarian cancers exhibit similar genetic changes). This means that therapeutics effective in treating one type of tumor may also be useful in treating other tumors exhibiting similar molecular changes. Offered in easy-to-use reagent kits, the new method will be used initially by researchers and clinical oncologists to discover the role of gene fusions in many more types of cancer and ultimately be used in molecular diagnostic products to guide treatment. It will also be used by pharmaceutical companies to develop, test and predict the efficacy of specific therapeutics for individual cancer patients. Amorese likened the new SPET method to  a microscope with greater power to detect fusions than has ever before been available. Now you can look for potential fusion events among hundreds of genes known to be associated with tumors just as easily as you can look at a single gene. Tests that narrowly focus on small subsets of potential fusions can be misleading and fail to take advantage of the power of next gen sequencing. Those tests are just scratching the surface as it relates to understanding what is happening in the cell,  Amorese said.","Published: July 2, 2015"

This test enables clinicians to more accurately predict the prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) than traditional methods.  The MMprofiler measures the activity of 92 genes which are directly or indirectly related to the disease. These measurements are repeated across different studies, always with the same robustness and predictable outcome, thereby creating a test that is more reliable than traditional methods. Based on gene activity, clinicians can then use the test to predict for their patients how the disease will progress.  Unfortunately, between twenty and twenty-five percent of patients are informed that their prognosis is poorer. The overall survival of these patients is four times lower, on average, and these patients can expect the disease to return more quickly after treatment than patients with a better prognosis. Several guidelines for the treatment of multiple myeloma, like mSMART guidelines, recommend that patients be treated in accordance with their prognosis.  Patients, patient advocacy organisations, internists and clinical geneticists have all expressed a strong interest in the new test. At a major European conference on blood and bone marrow cancers held in Vienna this June, it was revealed that approximately 80% of patients wanted to be informed about disease progress.   ""The key to a successful doctor-patient relationship is good communication   it isn t rocket science. Ask and involve them, be honest and listen very carefully to what they have to say"", says Mr Eric Low, chief executive officer of Myeloma UK, a patient advocacy group. The new test is also supported by Prof. Dr. Sonneveld of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, who recently received the Robert A. Kyle Lifetime Achievement Award for his work on multiple myeloma: ""We want to be able to predict disease progress based on the genetic properties of the malignant cell. While the current methods accommodate this need to some extent, it makes more sense to mark all genes involved in the incidence of multiple myeloma at once. Based on the profile generated, we can then divide patients based on their better or poorer prognosis.""","Published: July 2, 2015"

But while the recognition of their importance has soared in recent years, methods for studying them haven t always kept pace.   We established a new framework for interrogating a key feature of metabolic performance, which is how mitochondria move about within a cell,  said senior author David M. Eckmann, MD, PhD, the Horatio C. Wood Professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and professor of Bioengineering at Penn.  We can now use this technique when provoking aberrations of cellular health in a variety of ways to study disease and disease treatment.   Already we ve been able to use the new method to discover things about mitochondrial motility and how it can change on the whole-cell level,  said the study s first author Judith Kandel, a graduate student in Eckmann s laboratory.  Researchers are increasingly aware that the disruption of normal mitochondrial motility may be not only a sign, but also a driver of illness in neurodegenerative disorders, cancers and other conditions. Yet the available methods for tracking mitochondrial motions have had significant limitations. Most mitochondrial tracking studies have been in neurons, where mitochondria tend to move along lengthy nerve fibers (axons), and the simple one-dimensional tracking techniques used in such studies aren t applicable to other cell types. The general particle tracking methods used to follow mitochondria in non-neuronal cells also have been less than ideal.  Standard particle tracking methods tend to assume spherical particles, whereas mitochondria are more tubular; moreover a mitochondrion often splits into two or fuses with another, and general particle tracking methods don t account for that,  Kandel said. To devise a better method, Eckmann and his team started with an existing software application, ImageJ, published by the National Institutes of Health. They used it to turn raw videos of fluorescently-labeled mitochondria within whole skin cells into sharply resolved frames showing just the white mitochondria of one cell against a black background. They then applied a custom image-processing algorithm with object-recognition to the frames, in order to track individual objects as they moved slightly from frame to frame, and also to detect when they fused with or split off from other mitochondria. The researchers initially employed the technique to look broadly at mitochondrial motions within skin cells. Prior studies in non-neuronal cells, using other methods, had suggested that mitochondria mostly move semi-randomly, with some showing brief spurts of directed motion presumably aimed at parts of the cell where their energy supply is needed. The Penn scientists found something different: a smoother distribution of mitochondrial motility on the whole-cell level, specifically what is known as a log normal distribution.  The cutoff between directed motions and more diffusive motions seems to be much less clear than had been thought,  Kandel said. Eckmann s laboratory has been investigating how disease or toxin-related disturbances to the structural elements of cells lead to disruptions of mitochondrial functions. He, Kandel and Chou therefore applied the new tracking method in further experiments along these lines. In one experiment, they used a chemical to unravel railroad-like cellular structures called microtubules, along which mitochondria typically move and found, expectedly, a marked decrease in net mitochondrial motility. However, when they used a different compound to decompose actin microfilaments, which make up the basic  skeleton  structure of cells, they found that mitochondrial motility on average increased.  It s striking because it implies that actin microfilaments normally impede mitochondria,  Kandel said.  It s definitely a point for further investigation.  Eckmann s laboratory is now following up with similar experiments tracking mitochondrial motility in other healthy and diseased cell types, including cancer cells. ","Published: July 2, 2015"

Despite decades of progress in understanding the virus, an effective vaccine remains elusive. The lack of success is partly due to HIV s uncanny ability to evade the immune system. Now, a team of researchers including Duke computer scientist Bruce Donald and graduate student Mark Hallen have published a 3-D close-up of a designer protein that, if injected into patients, could help the immune system make better antibodies against the virus   a step forward in the 30-year HIV vaccine race. More than 35 million people worldwide are living with HIV, and about two million more people are infected each year. Antiretroviral drugs can prevent the virus from reproducing in the body once someone is infected, but only a vaccine can stop it from spreading from one person to the next. Vaccines work by triggering the immune system to make specialized proteins called antibodies, which prime the body to fight foreign substances. But in the case of HIV, not all antibodies work equally well. One reason is that HIV is always mutating in the body. HIV incorporates its genetic material into the DNA of its host, hijacking the cell s replication machinery and forcing it to make more copies of the virus. Each round of replication generates small genetic  mistakes,  resulting in slightly different copies that the host s antibodies may no longer recognize. Even before the body makes an antibody that works against one strain, the virus mutates again and makes a new one.  It s a race against a moving target,  said Hallen, who was also an undergraduate at Duke majoring in chemistry and mathematics. In the early 1990s, researchers discovered that a tiny fraction of people infected with HIV are able to produce antibodies that protect against many different strains at once. These  broadly neutralizing antibodies  fasten to the virus s surface like a key in a lock and prevent it from invading other cells. But HIV can evade detection by these powerful antibodies, as the part of its outer coat that is vulnerable to their attack is constantly changing shape. To overcome this problem, first the researchers needed a close-up look at the region of interest   a spike-shaped virus protein known as Env   in its most vulnerable state.A 3-D closeup of a key virus protein frozen in a shape the researchers say could serve as a template for a vaccine. Image courtesy of Bruce Donald. With this 3-D blueprint in hand, Hallen and former Duke PhD Ivelin Georgiev developed a scoring system and rated dozens of antibodies according to how well they bound to it. They confirmed that the specific conformation of the Env protein they identified was visible to effective antibodies but not ineffective ones. The team then identified amino acid sequence changes that would freeze the protein in the desired shape. Once locked in place, the researchers say, the protein could be injected into patients and used to coax their immune systems into preferentially churning out only the most effective antibodies.  The idea is to  tie  the protein so that it can t transition to some other conformation and elicit ineffective antibodies as soon as the effective antibodies bind,  Donald said.","Published: July 2, 2015"

By better understanding this, scientists will be better able to determine the risk that a new virus could infect humans and potentially cause a pandemic.  Previous research has mostly focused on changes in cell attachment and genome replication that are different between avian and human flu viruses, but our working hypothesis is that bird flu is subject to vastly different temperature and environment cycles upon transmission through the fecal-oral route than human flu, which is transmitted through aerosols and lung tissue,  said Tamm, of U.Va. s Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics.  Our international team of investigators will test the temperature hypothesis of host adaptation by looking at viral envelope remodeling as bird flu strains adapt to human transmission conditions.  In bird flu s current form, humans can contract it only through direct contact with birds.

Pivotal results from the KTE-C19 study are expected in 2016. Should those results prove promising, they could lead to the potential launch and commercialization of KTE-C19 in 2017, the partners said. Kite also plans to launch three additional trials of KTE-C19 before the end of this year. The trials will assess the gene therapy candidate s in mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Kite and LLS said. Based on the progress of the KTE-C19 development program, Kite agreed to make an undisclosed amount of milestone payments to LLS, and offer financial support to the society for its rollout of the education program. ""LLS is committed to supporting the development of potentially curative therapies for patients diagnosed with blood cancers, and we view KTE-C19 as a candidate with great potential for patients with lymphoma who have limited treatment options,"" LLS president and CEO Louis J. DeGennaro, Ph.D., said in a statement. Through TAP, LLS aims to speed up the development of innovative blood cancer treatments, supportive care, and diagnostics. TAP identifies and funds projects related to therapies, supportive care, or diagnostics that according to the society have the potential to change the standard of care for patients with blood cancer, especially in areas of high unmet medical need. According to LLS, TAP funding is designed to help clinical investigators and companies generate clinical proof of concept data in order to obtain additional resources. The society says the program can also help companies find a partner to help carry out testing, registration, and marketing of new treatments, supportive care, and diagnostics for leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. KTE-C19 is an investigational therapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor  designed to target the protein CD19, expressed on the cell surface of B cell lymphomas and leukemias.","Published: July 2, 2015"

It's a basic step in understanding the communication and cooperative processes that might lead to synthetic stem cells that could grow into artificial organs or organisms that require different types of cells to work together, according to the scientists.The red yeast cells produce a plant hormone, which  tells  the green cells to express a gene differently.Courtesy of University of Washington. ""Until you can actually build a multicellular organism that starts from a single cell, you don't really understand it. And until we can do that, it's going to be hard to do things like regrow a kidney for someone who needs it,"" said senior author Eric Klavins, Ph.D., a UW associate professor of electrical engineering and of bioengineering. It might also enable engineered yeast to perform complicated behaviors that coordinated multicellular systems such as our immune system can accomplish, like recognizing an invading pathogen and mounting a response. If so, one might program those cells to collaboratively diagnose the flu or malaria: just add saliva to a packet of yeast and see if it changes color. For now, though, the team spearheaded by lead authors Arjun Khakhar, a UW doctoral student in bioengineering, and Nicholas J. Bolten, a UW doctoral student in electrical engineering, simply wanted to see if it could induce one yeast cell to send a signal that sets off a cascade of changes in another cell. In the initial experiment, they used auxin, which yeast cells don't normally recognize or respond to, to ""turn off"" a target gene in another cell. In this case, the gene that was switched off was an inserted jellyfish gene that turned the yeast fluorescent green. ""This project was to find out whether we could use auxin to make the cells talk to each other in a really simple way,"" said Dr. Klavins. ""We're not sending complicated messages yet. One cell is saying 'hello?' and the other cell says 'I can hear you.' Eventually they'll say 'I'm this kind of cell. What are you? Let's work together.' But for now it's pretty much 'hi.'"" Synthetic biologists, who assemble genetic parts in new ways with the goal of popping them into an organism to produce reliable behaviors, have struggled to build modules that enable cell-to-cell communication in organisms that don't naturally do it. The UW team overcame this hurdle by engineering a suite of novel transcription factors with varying sensitivities to auxin. That tunability offers important control in regulating cell behavior. With co-author and UW associate biology professor Jennifer Nemhauser, Ph.D., the UW team figured out how to make a sender yeast cell produce auxin, a versatile hormone that controls everything from where a plant's roots develop to how effectively they fight off pathogens. Through trial and error, the team learned that an enzyme borrowed from a soil bacterium can induce yeast to convert a commonly available chemical into auxin. In the receiver yeast cells, the researchers inserted the new transcription factor and engineered it to activate the jellyfish gene that turned the cell green. When the sender cell released auxin, additional proteins that the researchers introduced in the receiver cell were able to degrade the new transcription factor and switch off the gene that turned the receiver cell green. That type of simple communication forms the bedrock of multicellular organisms in which different types of cells collaborate to carry out complicated tasks. As a next step, the UW team plans to test whether auxin can induce more complex behaviors in yeast cells, such as forming patterns or cooperatively computing basic functions. Since auxin is a plant hormone, mammalian cells also ignore it, making auxin a potentially useful tool in designing gene therapies or other applications without adverse reactions in humans. The UW method, which uses a guide RNA to target the gene of interest, could be adapted to produce a number of genetic or behavior changes. ""If you ask someone in computer science what they can do with a programming language, they'll laugh and say they can do anything with it,"" said Dr. Klavins. ""If we can figure out the programming language of life, we can do anything that life does, except in a more controllable, reliable way.""","Published: July 2, 2015"

Aske Stephenson specialises in developing hand-produced cocktails that are designed to introduce consumers to new and unusual flavour combinations, using a scientific approach that pushes taste boundaries.  Bibby Scientific s Stuart Rotary Evaporators are extremely reliable, safe and user-friendly instruments that are used widely in chemistry laboratories in universities and pharmaceutical companies. The Rotary Evaporators can also operate under vacuum, making them perfect for the unique distillation requirements of Aske Stephenson s cocktail mixology.   We needed to distil alcoholic liquids for making our cocktails, but the distillation process generates heat that can impair the cocktail flavours,  explained Thomas Aske, Aske Stephenson.  By placing the RE300 under vacuum, the pressure of the system is lowered, so we can distil our alcoholic liquids at lower temperatures and maximise the impact of our unusual flavours.  Katy Bridge, Assistant Product Manager at Bibby Scientific said,  We re really excited to be able to support Aske Stephenson in developing these innovative new cocktails. We re seeing increasing interest in applying scientific technologies to creative industries such as cocktail mixology, where the reliability and ease-of-use of Stuart instruments makes these lab science principles much more accessible.  Aske Stephenson is currently using Bibby s technologies to produce three award-winning cocktails:  Peanut Butter & Jam Old Fashioned (Gold medal winner)American Whiskey macerated with peanut butter and jam before being redistilled under pressure and seasoned.

Approximately 1.5 percent of boys ages 10-18 received an antipsychotic prescription in 2010, although the percentage falls by nearly half after age 19. Among antipsychotic users with mental disorder diagnoses, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most common among youth ages 1-18, while depression was the most common diagnosis among young adults ages 19-24 receiving antipsychotics. Despite concerns over the rising use of antipsychotic drugs to treat young people, little has been known about trends and usage patterns in the United States before this latest research, which was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), part of the National Institutes of Health. Mark Olfson, M.D., M.P.H., of the Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons and Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York City, and colleagues Marissa King, Ph.D., Yale, New Haven, Connecticut, and Michael Schoenbaum, Ph.D., NIMH, report their findings on July 1 in JAMA Psychiatry.  No prior study has had the data to look at age patterns in antipsychotic use among children the way we do here,  said co-author Michael Schoenbaum, Ph.D., senior advisor for mental health services, epidemiology and economics at NIMH.  What s especially important is the finding that around 1.5 percent of boys aged 10-18 are on antipsychotics, and then this rate abruptly falls by half, as adolescents become young adults.   Antipsychotics should be prescribed with care,  says Schoenbaum.  They can adversely affect both physical and neurological function and some of their adverse effects can persist even after the medication is stopped.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved antipsychotics for children with certain disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, psychosis/schizophrenia, and autism. However, the research team found that the medication use patterns do not match the illness patterns. The mismatch means that many antipsychotic prescriptions for young people may be for off-label purposes, that is, for uses not approved by FDA. For example, maladaptive aggression is common in ADHD, and clinical trial data suggest that at least one antipsychotic, risperidone, when used with stimulants, can help reduce aggression in ADHD. To date, FDA has not approved the use of any antipsychotic for ADHD, making its use for this diagnosis off-label. In the current study, the combination of peak use of antipsychotics in adolescent boys and the diagnoses associated with prescriptions (often ADHD) suggest that these medications are being used to treat developmentally limited impulsivity and aggression rather than psychosis. Olfson and colleagues worked with the IMS LifeLink LRx database, which includes 63 percent of outpatient prescriptions filled in the U.S. The team looked at prescription data for 2006-2010 and found antipsychotic use increased with age in both boys and girls, beginning at 0.11 percent in 2010 for ages 1-6 years, increasing to 0.80 percent for ages 7-12 years and increasing again to 1.19 percent for youth ages 13-18 years before dropping substantially to 0.84 percent for ages 19-24. In children ages 1-6, boys were more than twice as likely as girls to receive an antipsychotic prescription (0.16 vs. 0.06 percent in 2010). This pattern held true for boys and girls ages 7-12 (1.20 vs. 0.44 percent in 2010) before narrowing for the 13-18 age group (1.42 vs. 0.95 percent) and finally becoming more comparable for young men and women ages 19 to 24 (0.88 to 0.81 percent in 2010). Among young people treated with antipsychotics in 2010, the youngest children, ages 1-6, were the least likely to receive the prescription from a psychiatrist (57.9 vs. 71.9, 77.9, and 70.4 percent for the other three age groups). This is a source of concern, as practice guidelines caution practitioners on the use of antipsychotic medications for young children in particular. Among young people receiving antipsychotic prescriptions, fewer than half had any medical visit that included a mental disorder diagnosis. That may be in part due to stigma about mental illness, or because primary care providers are concerned about reimbursement for treatment related to such diagnoses.  In addition to having a new look at antipsychotic use among youth, one positive finding coming from this study is that around 75 percent of these kids have at least some contact with a psychiatrist,  said NIMH Director Thomas Insel, M.D.","Published: July 2, 2015"

Adult stem cells provide a ready supply of new cells needed for tissue homeostasis throughout the life of an organism. Specialized environments called  niches  help to maintain stem cells in an undifferentiated and self-renewing state. Cells that comprise the niche produce signals and growth factors essential for stem cell maintenance. The mechanisms that allow for reception of these signals exclusively by stem cells and not their more specialized progeny remain poorly understood.  This finding stands to change the way we think about how stem cells and their neighbors communicate with one another,  said Dr. Michael Buszczak, Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and with the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine. Scientists have been working to understand how the signaling between niches and stem cells works.  These signals act over a short range, so only stem cells   but not their differentiating progeny   receive the self-renewing signals,  said Dr. Buszczak, E.E. and Greer Garson Fogelson Scholar in Medical Research.  The mechanics of this communication were not known. What we discovered was that the stem cells form microtubule-based nanotubes, which extend into the niche. These threadlike nanotubes act like straws to tap into the niche and allow signaling to occur specifically in the stem cell.  The findings emanate from an active collaboration between the Buszczak lab at UT Southwestern and the lab of Dr. Yukiko Yamashita at the University of Michigan. Dr. Yamashita is an Associate Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of Michigan Life Sciences Institute and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. First author Dr. Mayu Inaba, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Life Sciences Institute and a visiting Senior Fellow in Molecular Biology at UT Southwestern in the Buszczak lab, noticed thin projections linking individual stem cells back to a central hub in the stem cell  niche.  Dr. Yamashita looked through her old image files and identified the same connections in numerous images.  I had seen them, but I wasn t seeing them,  Dr. Yamashita said. Dr. Inaba worked to further develop the project as a senior research fellow in the Buszczak lab over the last several years. The findings are important groundwork for understanding how stem cells reproduce and how miscommunication between cells can result in diseases like cancer. Too much stem cell production, for example, can lead to cancerous growth. Too little reproduction can result in inadequate renewal of cells and underlies the aging process. The long-term goal of Dr. Buszczak s lab is to determine the complete regulatory network that controls both the maintenance of Drosophila stem cells and the differentiation of their daughters.  We hope to use this information as a foundation for understanding how perturbations in normal gene expression programs cause disease,  Dr. Buszczak said. The mission of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine is to impact human health through discoveries of the fundamental mechanisms of tissue formation and repair, and to use this knowledge to develop transformative strategies and medicines to enhance tissue regeneration. The Center is led by Dr. Eric Olson, Chair of Molecular Biology at UT Southwestern.","Published: July 2, 2015"

The goal of the collaboration is to identify combination regimens that provide synergies in efficacy and durability in patients with metastatic cutaneous and uveal melanomas. Under the terms of the agreement, Immunocore and Lilly will conduct a Phase Ib/II clinical study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of IMCgp100 in combination with galunisertib in metastatic cutaneous melanoma. A second Phase Ib/II study will be conducted combining IMCgp100 with merestinib in metastatic uveal melanoma. Lilly will act as trial sponsor. These studies are anticipated to begin in 2016. No financial terms were disclosed. IMCgp100 and galunisertib are members of a new class of cancer treatments known as immunotherapies, which are designed to enhance the body's own immune system in fighting cancer and whose mechanisms of action have the potential to be complementary. IMCgp100 is Immunocore's most advanced Immune mobilizing mTCR Against Cancer molecules (ImmTAC), which are a novel class of bi-specific biologic drugs based on T cell receptors (TCRs) with ultra-high affinity for intracellular and extracellular cancer targets. Lilly's galunisertib is a small molecule inhibitor of TGF beta R1 kinase that in vitro selectively blocks TGF beta signaling. TGF beta promotes tumor growth, suppresses the immune system and increases the ability of tumors to spread in the body. Merestinib is Lilly's small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that in vitro selectively blocks signaling of MET, MST1R (RON), AXL, and MKNK1/2, pathways that potentially play a role in metastatic uveal melanoma. ""This collaboration with Immunocore underscores Lilly's commitment to discovering the potential of combination therapies, which will be key to the future of cancer care for people fighting diseases such as melanoma,"" said Richard Gaynor, M.D., senior vice president, product development and medical affairs for Lilly Oncology.

The company s latest CBR Pharma report states that biologics currently account for between 17 20% of the pharmaceutical arena, with a value of nearly $200 billion, and these products may replace 70% of chemical drugs in the next two decades. Sumith Ladda, Analyst for GBI Research, says the 30% to 50% reduction in biosimilar prices compared with branded biologics could lead to considerable savings in healthcare expenditure. Ladda comments:  There are currently 642 biosimilar trials being conducted, with 146 unique molecules. Biosimilars are most focused on oncology therapy, with a 36% share, while immunology treatment comprises 21% of the pipeline, meaning these two segments account for more than half of the total trials.  Historically, simple proteins, such as filgastrim and epotien, were the prime targets of biosimilar development, but the focus has now shifted to complex monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as there are numerous blockbuster mAbs going off-patent.  GBI Research s report also states that while a regulatory framework for biosimilars has been established in all major markets, some aspects, such as interchangeability, naming conventions and extrapolation across indications, need to be harmonized. Ladda continues:  The European Medicines Agency has the most robust and longest-standing guidelines for biosimilars. Countries such as Japan, China, and South Korea have developed guidelines similar to these.  The US Food and Drug Administration finalized guidelines for biosimilars in 2014 and approved its first biosimilar, Zarxio, on March 6, 2015. This marks the entry of biosimilars in the US, and has increased industry confidence in the country s biosimilars market.  The analyst adds that the US biologics space is twice the size of its European equivalent by value, but the uptake of biosimilars in Europe is nearly four times higher, indicating the significant future potential of biosimilars in the US.","Published: July 2, 2015"

Published in Molecular Psychiatry, the ENIGMA study is co-authored by University of Sydney scholars at the Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI). The research is the largest international study to compare brain volumes in people with and without major depression. It highlights the need to identify and treat depression effectively when it first occurs, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Using magnetic resonance imaged (MRI) brain scans, and clinical data from 1,728 people with major depression and 7,199 healthy individuals, the study combined 15 datasets from Europe, the USA and Australia. Major depression is a common condition affecting at least one in six people during their lifetime. It is a serious clinical mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, frustration, loss, or anger interfere with a person's everyday life for weeks, months or years at a time. The key finding that people with major depression have a smaller hippocampus confirms earlier clinical work conducted at the BMRI. In this study, the key finding was largely explained by subjects with recurrent depression. People with recurrent depression represented 65 per cent of study subjects with major depression. People with an early age of onset of major depression (before the age of 21 years) also had a smaller hippocampus than healthy individuals, consistent with the notion that many of these young people go on to have recurrent disorders. However, people who had a first episode of major depression (34 per cent of study subjects with major depression) did not have a small hippocampus than healthy individuals, indicating that the changes are due to the adverse effects of depressive illness on the brain. ""These findings shed new light on brain structures and possible mechanisms responsible for depression,"" says Associate Professor Jim Lagopoulos of the University of Sydney's BMRI. ""Despite intensive research aimed at identifying brain structures linked to depression in recent decades, our understanding of what causes depression is still rudimentary. ""One reason for this has been the lack of sufficiently large studies, variability in the disease and treatments provided, and the complex interactions between clinical characteristics and brain structure."" Commenting on the clinical significance of the findings, Co-Director of the BMRI, Professor Ian Hickie says: ""This large study confirms the need to treat first episodes of depression effectively, particularly in teenagers and young adults, to prevent the brain changes that accompany recurrent depression. ""This is another reason that we need to ensure that young people receive effective treatments for depression -- a key goal of our Centre of Research Excellence in Optimising Early Interventions for Young People with Emerging Mood Disorder. ""This new finding of smaller hippocampal volume in people with major depression may offer some support to the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression,"" adds Jim Lagopoulos. ""This hypothesis argues that a range of neurobiological processes such as elevated glucocorticoid levels in those with chronic depression may induce brain shrinkage. ""Clearly, there's a need for longitudinal studies that can track changes in hippocampal volume among people with depression over time, to better clarify whether hippocampal abnormalities result from prolonged duration of chronic stress, or represent a vulnerability factor for depression, or both,"" he said.

The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows how circadian clock machinery in the brain encodes seasonal changes in daylight duration through GABA activity along with changes in the amount of chloride located inside certain neurons. Seasonal time keeping is important for animals as well as people, and recent studies indicate that it is accomplished by the same part of the brain that governs our daily circadian rhythms. This brain area, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), cyclically expresses certain  clock  genes during a 24-hour period, but not all of the neurons march to the same beat. Two regions in the SCN are slightly out of phase, and as day length increases, so does the phase gap between them. To understand how this happens, the researchers first measured expression levels of the clock gene Bmal1 in explanted dorsal and ventral SCNs of mice that had been living in long-day or short-day light cycles. As expected, cyclical Bmal1 levels in dorsal and ventral regions from the long-day group were out of phase, while those from the short-day group were synchronized. Modeling analysis predicted that coupling between the two regions is not a two-way street, and that this asymmetry causes the dorsal region to become out of phase when daylight increases. The research team found that the neurotransmitter GABA plays an important role in this process. In most cases, GABA inhibits the activity of neurons. However, some SCN neurons are actually excited by GABA. Lead author Jihwan Myung explains,  GABA becomes excitatory when chloride levels inside neurons are high. We suspected that changes in GABA function across the SCN could represent the repulsive force that pushes these two clusters of neurons out of phase.  When the researchers blocked GABA activity, the large phase gap seen in the long-day group disappeared and the cycles of Bmal1 levels came to resemble those of the short-day group, which was unaffected. This suggested to the team that GABA has a special effect on the dorsal SCN. To test this hypothesis, they measured expression levels of two other genes Nkcc1 and Kcc2 that are responsible for importing and exporting chloride. They found that in long-day SCNs, the expression ratio of the two genes in the dorsal SCN changed so that much more chloride was imported. This made the effect of GABA preferentially excitatory in the dorsal region. Blocking chloride import abolished the phase gap seen in the long-day group, and as predicted by the model, even made SCNs trained on an even 12-hour daylight cycle resemble the short-day group.  Just like in other animals, our bodies keep track of the seasons,  says Myung,  and sudden changes in seasonal day length can cause severe mood disorder in some individuals. Understanding how to adjust our internal seasonal clock could lead to effective ways of helping people whose internal clocks have been disrupted.

Dr. Mavria said: ""We want to understand how these tumours form and grow, but we still need to do more research to stop these tumours growing altogether. ""The finding gives an important indicator of how the protein affects the growth of secondary breast tumours in the brain. The discovery could also enable experts to predict which patients might be at risk of their breast cancer spreading, and develop drugs to prevent the growth of secondary tumours."" Working with Professor Chris Marshall, Professor of Cell Biology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London and the late Dr. Tony Pawson at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, researchers found that a complex of two related proteins, DOCK4 and DOCK9, is critical in the formation of the lumen, the interior space of a vessel through which blood flows. By impeding the speed at which the lumen forms, tumours are not fed as effectively by blood vessels. Normally, when breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it forces new blood vessels to form to supply it with nutrients and oxygen to help it to grow, resulting in tumours that are very difficult to treat. Professor Marshall said: ""Our study reveals new insights into how the complex process of forming blood vessels is controlled. This knowledge could lead to new approaches to preventing the blood supply to tumours and metastases. If we can find new ways to reduce the blood supply to tumours, we might be able to find new ways to slow cancer growth in future."" Dr. Matthew Lam, Senior Research Communications Officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: ""These findings could one day help us better identify and treat patients that might be at risk of their breast cancer spreading to the brain, a particularly common site for metastasis. ""12,000 women have their lives cut short by breast cancer in the UK each year. An understanding of what is happening on a molecular level - such as the role played by DOCK proteins - will be essential if we are to find ways to prevent secondary tumours and finally stop women dying from the disease."" Kathryn Scott, Head of Research and Innovation at Yorkshire Cancer Research, said: ""Tumours need blood vessels to grow, but these blood vessels could be the cancer's weakest link because it is believed that they are less able to become resistant to drugs than the cancer cells themselves. Targeting drugs to the blood vessels that are serving the tumour rather than the tumour itself is an exciting new area of research and we are supporting a number of projects in Yorkshire which are investigating this approach."" Dr. Aine McCarthy, Science Information Officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ""This research shows for the first time that a molecule called DOCK4 is a key player in tumour blood vessel development and blocking it could slow tumour growth by starving the cancer cells. But the study was carried out in mice, so more research is needed to see if drugs can be developed that target the molecule and whether this approach would be safe and effective in people with cancer.""","Published: July 1, 2015"

Food sales in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are expected to grow during this peak season, with local retailers anticipating 10 per cent to 15 per cent increase. The GCC countries are overwhelmingly dependent on food imports to meet their growing requirements. With imports representing between 80-90 per cent of GCC food consumption, Intertek s assistance in strengthening the food supply chain becomes even more critical, said the statement. Globally, demand for food is projected to increase by 50 per cent over the next 20 years and the region is showing a similar trajectory. In particular, the GCC growth potential of the food industry is largely due to population growth, changing consumption patterns and continuous modernisation of the supply chain. With globalisation encouraging international players to enter the regional markets and local ones to expand their foothold in the sector, regional governments are implementing quality frameworks to ensure the health and safety of their citizens. As a result, demand for food testing is on a steep rise with a 35 per cent growth in handling food samples in Intertek's regional labs. Intertek s food business in the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan region increased by 50 per cent last year over the previous year, as a result of greater food inspections at loading ports, testing, analysis, auditing, certification and food consulting activities.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/animals-genomic-buffers-may-help-humans-186588,Animals  Genomic Buffers May Help Humans Researchers at Duke University School of Medicine and Brigham and Women s Hospital  Harvard Medical School have identified a mechanism that explains why some mutations can be disease causing in one genome but benign in another   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The researchers compared thousands of human disease-causing mutations with the analogous sequences of some 100 animal species. They discovered non-human genomes carrying mutations that cause severe disease in humans, yet were benign in the animals. Although generally in line with earlier observations, the scale of the findings motivated geneticists to find the explanation for this apparent mystery.   We found many examples in which an entire species should have a serious genetic ailment, but instead were healthy,  said Nicholas Katsanis, Ph.D., director of the Center for Human Disease Modeling and professor cell biology and pediatrics at Duke.  So, if we can understand how animals escape illness from such severe genetic mutations, we might have a way to make humans better.  What we considered is that for many mutations, there must be a buffering mechanism   another mutation that protects the animal from the detrimental affects of the disease-causing mutation,  Katsanis said. The researchers considered two possible explanations: Disease suppression might be the result of one or two additional substitutions on the same gene that buffer the harmful effect of the mutation; or suppression may be caused by numerous small substitutions throughout the genome that form an aggregate  shield.   Evolutionary theory told us that such a shield must exist, we just did not know how if would work,  Katsanis said.  Now we know at least part of the answer.  The team tracked changes in protein sequence that travelled with the disease-causing mutation and were candidates for offering protection. If a species lost the  traveler , it would also have to eliminate the mutation or become extinct.  The researches tested this notion using molecular tools to identify these sites. They first engineered mutant proteins that were defective, then added secondary sites and were able to completely restore protein function.  In the end, it looks like you can shield mutations with a single change elsewhere in the same gene, creating a single champion.  Katsanis added. With the advent of genome engineering, scientists are now introducing hundreds of different human mutations in other species to study their effects and develop new drugs. Because the effect of mutations on protein function might be dependent on the broader context of the human sequence, this approach will also lead to serious false negative conclusions, Katsanis warns.   We are really beginning to appreciate the fundamental complexity of the human genome and genomes in general,  Katsanis said.  It used to be black-and-white: mutation, bad; no mutation, good. But it s far more complex. We are now beginning to be able to compute the effect of mutations in the context of the rest of the genome. There is no question that this will improve our ability to interpret human genomes and inform clinical practice  Co-author Shamil Sunyaev, Ph.D., professor of medicine at Brigham and Women s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, agrees that the results highlight the complexity of interpreting DNA sequences.  Our study provides an example of the utility of comparative genomics and evolutionary models for medicine,  Sunyaev said.  At the same time, it shows how data accumulated by medical geneticists can be used to better understand evolution. Beyond medicine and evolution, the logical next step would be to explain biochemical mechanisms underlying interactions between mutations. ","Published: July 1, 2015"

The membranes we created, though completely synthetic, mimic several features of more complex living organisms, such as the ability to adapt their composition in response to environmental cues,  said Neal Devaraj, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego who headed the research team, which included scientists from the campus  BioCircuits Institute.  Many other scientists have exploited the ability of lipids to self-assemble into bilayer vesicles with properties reminiscent of cellular membranes, but until now no one has been able to mimic nature s ability to support persistent phospholipid membrane formation,  he explained.  We developed an artificial cell membrane that continually synthesizes all of the components needed to form additional catalytic membranes.  The scientists said in their paper that to develop the growing membrane they substituted a  complex network of biochemical pathways used in nature with a single autocatalyst that simultaneously drives membrane growth.  In this way, they added,  our system continually transforms simpler, higher-energy building blocks into new artificial membranes.   Our results demonstrate that complex lipid membranes capable of indefinite self-synthesis can emerge when supplied with simpler chemical building blocks,  said Devaraj.  Synthetic cell membranes that can grow like real membranes will be an important new tool for synthetic biology and origin of life studies. ","Published: July 1, 2015"

The companies said Monday they will develop treatments with an initial focus on chimeric antigen receptor technology (CAR-T) and T cell receptor (TCR) technologies. Under the collaboration, Celgene has the option to serve as commercialization partner for Juno's oncology and cell therapy autoimmune product candidates, including Juno's CD19- and CD22-directed CAR-T product candidates. The collaboration will not develop products targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), the focus of a Celgene collaboration with bluebird bio that the companies revised nearly a month ago. For Juno-originated programs co-developed through the collaboration, Juno will oversee R&D in North America and will retain commercialization rights there. Celgene will be responsible for development and commercialization elsewhere in the world, and has agreed to pay Juno high single-digit to mid-teens royalties on sales in those territories depending on development stage, the companies said. Celgene has initial rights to select two programs except for CD19 and CD22 with both subject to a global profit sharing agreement under which the companies will share worldwide expenses and profits equally, except in China. Celgene may also select a third program, subject to additional obligations, the companies said. Juno will have the option to enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement on some Celgene-originated development candidates that target T cells. For any such programs, the companies have agreed to share global costs and profits with 70% for Celgene and the remaining 30% for Juno. Celgene will lead global development and commercialization efforts, subject to a Juno co-promote option in the U.S. and certain EU territories.  We believe this long-term collaboration enhances the potential of both companies to deliver transformational therapies to patients with significant unmet medical needs,  Celgene chairman and CEO Bob Hugin said in a statement. Added Juno CEO Hans Bishop:  Celgene has leading small molecule and protein capabilities that complement Juno's advanced engineered T cell capabilities. By doing this together, we believe we can more quickly and effectively develop potentially disruptive therapies in this new field of medicine and make them more readily available to patients worldwide.  In addition to the $150 million in upfront cash, Celgene agreed to buy more than 9.1 million shares of Juno's common stock roughly 10% of the company s shares as of June 26 at an aggregate price of about $850 million, or $93 per share. That ownership interest can grow to up to 19.99% if Celgene buys shares between June 29, 2019 and June 28, 2020. And as long as it owns at least 17% by June 29, 2024, Celgene will have the right through the end of the collaboration to buy up to 30% of outstanding shares of Juno s common stock. In return, Celgene won the right to nominate a director to Juno s board  Thomas O. Daniel, M.D., president of Celgene Research and Early Development as well as the right to buy more shares in its partner at set time windows and market premiums. Those sweeteners are subject to conditions that include Juno agreeing to partner on select Celgene programs, and the biotech giant owning up to a maximum 30% of Juno's common stock. Celgene also agreed to Celgene has entered into a standstill agreement and agreed to certain lock-up provisions on its share ownership.  We believe this deal is mutually beneficial to each party, with Juno receiving very substantial upfront funding, recognition from an industry leader with heritage in cellular therapy while maintaining rights in North America and [Celgene] leaping to the forefront of cell-based immunotherapy and gaining access to potential CAR-T and TCR therapies,  Howard Liang, Ph.D., managing director, biotechnology with Leerink Research, said in a note to investors. Dr. Liang added that Juno s pipeline of CAR-T cell products  is arguably the most extensive in the industry,  and includes JCAR015, which he noted was the clinically most advanced CD19-directed CAR-T product for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). He also cited Juno s access to technology through the three institutions that launched the company in 2013, The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Seattle Children s Research Institute. Even before the Celgene collaboration, Juno was already well funded, having raised about $265 million through an initial public offering in December 2014. Before the IPO, Juno had privately raised more than $300 million from investors that include Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. The boards of Celgene and Juno have approved the deal, which is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under all applicable antitrust laws and satisfaction of other usual and customary closing conditions. Both companies said they expect to complete the transaction during the third quarter of this year.","Published: July 1, 2015"

For the epigenetic agent resminostat, an HADC inhibitor targeting in particular HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 6, the US Patent Office has granted the patent for the medical use in cancer indications. The patent relates to the so-called method of treatment claims, and covers medical application of resminostat in mono- and/or combination therapy for cancer indications. In addition, the Canadian patent authority has granted the composition of matter patent for resminostat. Thus resminostat has now composition of matter protection in all major markets including the US, Europe, Japan, China, South Korea, Russia, India, and now Canada. The granting of the two patents constitutes an additional protection against potential competitors and thus further strengthens the protection of 4SC s intellectual property assets, including the composition of matter, mesylate salt and manufacturing patents of resminostat, for which up to date patents have been granted in 58 countries, including the major markets. Enno Spillner, Chief Executive Officer of 4SC, said: ""We are pleased to announce the recent additions to our patent portfolio. The two patents will further strengthen not only the wide strategic position of our resminostat programme but also of 4SC as an important player in the field of epigenetic cancer therapies.  Enno Spillner continued:  Especially, the resminostat medical application patent shows the broad possibilities of future use of our lead drug candidate.

One teaspoon full of blood alone is believed to have around 5 million T cells. But these cells can also do harm, mistaking our own cells for invaders and attacking them, leading to autoimmune diseases such as lupus, Crohn s disease and type 1 diabetes. Among these T cells are CD8 T cells, the  foot soldiers  that go into battle and kill unwanted invaders. As with any army, in the face of a huge attack they can become  exhausted    in the case of the immune system, by inhibitory signals   and no longer fight effectively. Whether they become exhausted depends on both the size of the battle (or amount of invading  antigen ) and the amount of supporting signals they receive from a second type of cell, known as a CD4 helper T cell. These are the  generals  in the immune system, which coordinate our immune response. Exhaustion can affect the performance of the immune system and allow chronic infections, such as hepatitis C or HIV, to persist. Scientists from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research looked at patterns of genes that were turned on and off in patients with autoimmune diseases and found similarities with those seen in people with chronic infection, such as hepatitis C, and cancer: in other words, they have shown that the same process of T cell  exhaustion  known to be involved in the immune response to chronic infection and cancer is also important in many autoimmune diseases. However, the researchers found a key difference: an exhausted immune response toward infection results in worse outcome   the infection persists; for autoinflammatory diseases, the opposite is true   an exhausted immune response results in a milder course of the disease, with fewer relapses. Dr Eoin McKinney, a Wellcome Trust-Beit Research Fellow from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, first author of the study, explains:  We know that the way our bodies respond to infection and to autoimmune diseases differs between individuals. In part, we believe this is due to a process known as T cell exhaustion. For effective treatment, we need to exhaust our T cell responses in autoimmune diseases   and hence limit the attack on our body   and to reverse exhaustion when the fight is against unwanted invaders, such as viruses or cancer.  During chronic infection, blocking the inhibitory signals can restore CD8 cells to begin fighting again and clear chronic infection. The researchers were able to show in vitro that, by enhancing the same inhibitory signals, CD8 cells could be made exhausted, which should limit damage to the body that characterises autoimmune disease. The team believe their discovery could help doctors better target medicines at patients with autoimmune disease. At the moment, when a patient presents with such a disease for the first time, doctors have no way of predicting what their long-term future holds. Patients whose T cells exhibit signs of exhaustion early in the course of disease have a better long-term outcome, and thus might require less treatment. Conversely those with  non-exhausted  T cells at diagnosis do badly in the long term, and may benefit from more intensive or novel therapy. The team at the Department of Medicine has commenced a trial, supported by the Wellcome Trust, that applies this approach to patients with inflammatory bowel disease to see whether it can guide their treatment and improve their clinical outcome. Professor Ken Smith, lead author of the study and Head of the Department of Medicine, says:  We believe the clinical implications of this study could be profound. A test based on the concept is soon to enter the clinic, and we are exploring new treatments for autoimmunity based on manipulating T cell exhaustion. A focus on T cell exhaustion in cancer has led to a revolution in treatment and a multi-billion dollar industry. We now implicate the same pathways in determining long term patient outcome in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, which afflict up to one in ten of the population over the course of their lives.

The findings are consistent with some other studies about the impact of fat and sugar on cognitive function and behavior, and suggest that some of these problems may be linked to alteration of the microbiome   a complex mixture in the digestive system of about 100 trillion microorganisms. The research was done with laboratory mice that consumed different diets and then faced a variety of tests, such as water maze testing, to monitor changes in their mental and physical function, and associated impacts on various types of bacteria.   It s increasingly clear that our gut bacteria, or microbiota, can communicate with the human brain,  said Kathy Magnusson, a professor in the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine and principal investigator with the Linus Pauling Institute.  Bacteria can release compounds that act as neurotransmitters, stimulate sensory nerves or the immune system, and affect a wide range of biological functions,  she said.  We re not sure just what messages are being sent, but we are tracking down the pathways and the effects.  Mice have proven to be a particularly good model for studies relevant to humans, Magnusson said, on such topics as aging, spatial memory, obesity and other issues. In this research, after just four weeks on a high-fat or a high-sugar diet, the performance of mice on various tests of mental and physical function began to drop, compared to animals on a normal diet. One of the most pronounced changes was in what researchers call cognitive flexibility.  The impairment of cognitive flexibility in this study was pretty strong,  Magnusson said.  Think about driving home on a route that s very familiar to you, something you re used to doing. Then one day that road is closed and you suddenly have to find a new way home.  A person with high levels of cognitive flexibility would immediately adapt to the change, determine the next best route home, and remember to use the same route the following morning, all with little problem. With impaired flexibility, it might be a long, slow, and stressful way home. This study was done with young animals, Magnusson said, which ordinarily would have a healthier biological system that s better able to resist pathological influences from their microbiota. The findings might be even more pronounced with older animals or humans with compromised intestinal systems, she said. What s often referred to as the  Western diet,  or foods that are high in fat, sugars and simple carbohydrates, has been linked to a range of chronic illnesses in the United States, including the obesity epidemic and an increased incidence of Alzheimer s disease.  We ve known for a while that too much fat and sugar are not good for you,  Magnusson said.  This work suggests that fat and sugar are altering your healthy bacterial systems, and that s one of the reasons those foods aren t good for you. It s not just the food that could be influencing your brain, but an interaction between the food and microbial changes. ","Published: July 1, 2015"

When you are worried about something at work, do you find yourself more exhausted at the end of the day? This phenomenon is a result of the activation of a specific area of the brain when we attempt to participate in both physical and mental tasks simultaneously. Ranjana Mehta, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health, conducted a study evaluating the interaction between physical and mental fatigue and brain behavior. The study showed that when we attempt mental tasks and physical tasks at the same time, we activate specific areas, called prefrontal cortex (PFC), in our brain. This can cause our bodies to become fatigued much sooner than if we were solely participating in a physical task. Typically, endurance and fatigue have been examined solely from a physical perspective, focused primarily on the body and muscles used to complete a specific task. However, the brain is just like any other biological tissue, it can be overused and can suffer from fatigue.  Existing examinations of physical and mental fatigue has been limited to evaluating cardiovascular, muscular and biomechanical changes,  said Mehta.  The purpose of this study was to use simultaneous monitoring of brain and muscle function to examine the impact on the PFC while comparing the changes in brain behavior with traditional measures of fatigue.  According to Mehta, study findings show that there were lower blood oxygen levels in the PFC following combined physical and mental fatigue compared to that of just physical fatigue conditions. Through simultaneous examination of the brain and muscle function it is apparent that when participating in highly cognitive tasks, brain resources are divided which may accelerate the development of physical fatigue. It is critical that researchers consider the brain as well as the body when examining fatigue development and its impact on the body. Interdisciplinary work that combines neurocognitive principles with physiological and biomechanical outcomes can provide us with a comprehensive understanding of what is happening to the body when we perform our daily activities.  Not a lot of people see the value in looking at both the brain and the body together,  said Mehta.  However, no one does purely physical or mental work; they always do both.

These findings have far-reaching implications for our basic understanding of pain, how we develop the next generation of medications for chronic pain which is by far the most prevalent human health condition and the way we execute basic biomedical research using mice.  Research has demonstrated that men and women have different sensitivity to pain and that more women suffer from chronic pain than men, but the assumption has always been that the wiring of how pain is processed is the same in both sexes,  said co-senior author Jeffrey Mogil, Ph.D., E.P. Taylor Professor of Pain Studies at McGill University and Director of the Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain.  The realization that the biological basis for pain between men and women could be so fundamentally different raises important research and ethical questions if we want to reduce suffering.  The research was conducted by teams from McGill University, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), and Duke University, and looked at the longstanding theory that pain is transmitted from the site of injury or inflammation through the nervous system using an immune system cell called microglia. This new research shows that this is only true in male mice. Interfering with the function of microglia in a variety of different ways effectively blocked pain in male mice, but had no effect in female mice. According to the researchers, a completely different type of immune cell, called T cells, appears to be responsible for sounding the pain alarm in female mice. However, exactly how this happens remains unknown.  Understanding the pathways of pain and sex differences is absolutely essential as we design the next generation of more sophisticated, targeted pain medications,  said Michael Salter, M.D., Ph.D., Head and Senior Scientist, Neuroscience & Mental Health at SickKids and Professor at The University of Toronto, the other co-senior author.  We believe that mice have very similar nervous systems to humans, especially for a basic evolutionary function like pain, so these findings tell us there are important questions raised for human pain drug development.  The discovery comes as there is increased attention to the inclusion of female animals and cells in preclinical research. The U.S. National Institutes of Health recently unveiled a new policy, similar to one already in force in Canada, to require the use of female animals and cell lines in preclinical research.  For the past 15 years scientists have thought that microglia controlled the volume knob on pain, but this conclusion was based on research using almost exclusively male mice,  said Mogil.  This finding is a perfect example of why this policy, and very carefully designed research, is essential if the benefits of basic science are to serve everyone.

The findings appear in the July issue of The Journal of General Physiology. The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye that converts light into nerve impulses. The retina contains small, specialized neurons called bipolar cells that transmit information from light-sensitive photoreceptor cells to ganglion neurons, which send information to the brain for interpretation as images. Bipolar cells are continuously active, a characteristic few other neurons share. They require a constant supply of energy to mediate the sustained release of the contents of an enormous number of synaptic vesicles, which store the transmitters that convey information between neurons. An intriguing new study of their subcellular structure could help explain how bipolar synaptic terminals meet such excessive energy demands. Using cutting-edge 3D microscopy, researchers from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Yale University examined the subcellular architecture of presynaptic terminals in retinal bipolar cells of live goldfish. Goldfish retinal bipolar cells have giant presynaptic terminals that make them especially amenable for investigation. Unexpectedly, the team discovered a thick band of microtubules, a component of the cell's cytoskeleton, that extended from the axon of the neuron into the synaptic terminal and then looped around the interior periphery of the terminal. The microtubule band appeared to associate with mitochondria--organelles known for providing energy to cells--in the synaptic terminal. When the researchers administered drugs to inhibit the movement of certain ""motor"" proteins that transport mitochondria and other cargo within the cell by traveling along microtubules, the mitochondria accumulated in the axon of the neuron and never made it to the synaptic terminal. The findings suggest that these previously unknown microtubule structures provide a ""roadway"" for the transport of mitochondria crucial to maintain energy supplies into the synaptic terminals of these highly active neurons associated with vision.

SAPH-ire has been tested on a well-studied class of proteins involved in cellular communication, where it correctly predicted a previously-unknown regulatory element. ""SAPH-ire predicts positions on proteins that are likely to be important for biological function based on how many times those parts of the proteins have been found in a chemically-modified state when they are taken out of a cell,"" explained Matthew Torres, an assistant professor in the School of Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""SAPH-ire is a tool for discovery, and we think it will lead to a new understanding of how proteins are connected in cells."" Through modern mass spectrometry proteomics techniques, scientists have identified more than 300,000 post-translational modifications (PTMs) in different families of proteins across numerous species. These PTMs come in many forms, resulting from the action of different enzymes, and are often indicators of how and where proteins contact one another to bring about different cell behaviours. The number of PTMs detected by mass spectrometry has grown so rapidly that researchers experimentally investigating the function of the modifications have been unable to keep up. ""Mass spectrometry is so effective that it has created an exponential curve in the knowledge of how proteins are modified,"" said Torres. ""The rate at which we can detect new PTMs has now far surpassed the rate at which we can understand what they do, from a classical biochemical approach. You have so much information that you don't know where to begin."" But that's exactly where SAPH-ire begins. Aimed at bridging the gap between PTM detection and analysis of function, SAPH-ire collects non-redundant and experimentally verified PTM data across all known members of a protein family. Since members of a protein family share the same or similar protein structures, PTMs found within the family can be related to one another in three-dimensional space to produce a set of observed PTM frequencies, termed ""hotspots."" The PTM hotspots are projected onto 3D protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which allows the entire set of family-specific PTMs to be visualized on any protein structure that is representative for the family. Once projected there, SAPH-ire integrates multiple quantitative features from each hotspot to create a PTM ""Functional Potential Score."" Each PTM hotspot can then be ranked in order of highest to lowest potential for having significant biological function. ""We have gone through all of what might be considered the meta-data that exists in the public domain, collected all the PTMs and all the structures, then organized them into their specific protein families,"" Torres explained. ""We are looking at PTMs through time, in a sense, because we have information from organisms that are evolutionarily distant from each other, though their proteins are related as members of a protein family."" To prioritize research with the most significant potential impact, scientists might examine PTM hotspots that SAPH-ire identifies as having high function potential, but no known function. Torres' lab has been investigating unique families of ""G"" proteins, some of which cooperate with cell surface receptors that control the binding of hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as a majority of pharmaceutical drugs. Because of their importance to therapeutics, these proteins have been extensively studied over a period of 50 years or so. Using SAPH-ire, the researchers discovered something surprising about this group of protein families. ""We discovered a new regulatory element within a specific G protein family that has been largely ignored because it's pretty unimpressive from a purely structural viewpoint,"" Torres said. ""SAPH-ire predicted that this element was going to be important from a modification point of view, and we confirmed experimentally that it was.""","Published: June 30, 2015"

The new antibodies that identify and neutralize Marburg virus which has a mortality rate of up to 90% were developed through an academic-industrial partnership including TSRI, Integrated Biotherapeutics, Mapp Biopharmaceutical and Emergent BioSolutions. Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments specifically for Marburg infections. New Tools to Fight Marburg Virus The new study builds on previous work in Saphire s lab revealing a molecular structure that Marburg virus uses to attach to and enter host cells. To defeat Marburg virus, scientists are looking for vulnerable sites on the virus s surface where an antibody can bind. Previous research, including trials with the experimental ZMappTM treatment, shows that mixtures or  cocktails  of antibodies can block Ebola virus from infecting new cells and alert the immune system to the presence of the infection. It s thought that a similar cocktail strategy could work against Marburg virus. Antibodies against one site on Marburg were revealed in a study by Vanderbilt University and TSRI in February 2015, but complementary antibodies needed against other sites remained to be discovered. In the new study, TSRI researchers designed proteins which elicited new antibodies developed at Emergent BioSolutions. Other antibodies in the study were independently identified at Mapp Biopharmaceutical and Integrated Biotherapeutics, which collaborated with TSRI for molecular analysis. Some of the new antibodies target a new site on Marburg virus not seen before a wing-like feature attached to the base of the virus. Antibodies against this newly discovered site protected 90 to 100% of infected animal models from lethal infection. Ebola Virus Also Vulnerable Some antibodies discovered in the new study are also able to cross-react with Ebola virus and its four relatives in the Ebolavirus genus.  We expect both Marburg virus and Ebola virus to emerge again and to acquire new mutations,  said TSRI Research Assistant Marnie Fusco, first author of the new study.  The cross-reactive antibodies could be used as diagnostics for newly emerging strains.   The high cost of creating independent vaccines or treatments for each of the different viruses in this family necessitates intelligent design of immunogens (antibody-inducing molecules).  The molecular images used to design the molecules and evaluate the antibodies point the way forward,  added Jody Berry, the former Director of Pipeline Research of Emergent BioSolutions, who initiated the study with Saphire six years ago.  Understanding where and how the antibodies interact with the virus tells us which regions can be targeted and helps us develop lead candidates for clinical development,  said Cory Nykiforuk, current director of pipeline research of Emergent BioSolutions.  There are multiple filoviruses that threaten our communities, front line medical workers and defense personnel, and bringing new technologies to the forefront could potentially help meet future requirements.

A large number of genes are involved in regulating body weight, and there are now over 30 genes known in which people with harmful changes in DNA sequence become extremely overweight. Similarly, there are a number of genes that can, when altered, cause type 2 diabetes. These conditions are inherited through families in exactly the same way as disorders such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. It is unclear what proportion of severe obesity and type 2 diabetes is caused by genetic disease. Researchers at Imperial College London discovered the new defect by sequencing the DNA of an extremely obese young woman and members of her family. In addition to an increased appetite leading to severe weight problems from childhood, she had type 2 diabetes, learning difficulties, and reproductive problems.  They found that she had inherited two copies of a harmful genetic change that meant she could not make a protein called carboxypeptidase-E (CPE). This is an enzyme that is important in the proper processing of a number of hormones and brain transmitters controlling appetite, insulin and other hormones important in the reproductive system. Studies have previously shown that CPE deficiency causes obesity, diabetes, and impaired memory in mice, but no humans with the condition have been found before. CPE deficiency is a recessive condition, so a person would need to inherit the altered genetic sequence from both parents to be affected. Professor Alex Blakemore from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, who led the study, said: ""There are now an increasing number of single-gene causes of obesity and diabetes known. We don't know how many more have yet to be discovered, or what proportion of the severely obese people in our population have these diseases - it is not possible to tell just by looking.  ""These are serious disorders that affect the body's ability to regulate hunger and fullness signals. They are inherited in the just same way as other genetic diseases and the sufferers should not be stigmatised for their condition. They should be offered genetic counselling and specialised lifelong support to allow them as healthy a life as possible."" The patient was clinically evaluated by consultant endocrinologist Dr Tony Goldstone, who runs a specialist genetics obesity clinic at Hammersmith Hospital. The patient's parents are cousins, giving her a relatively high likelihood of inheriting the same genetic change from both parents. She had an older brother with similar symptoms who died aged 21.  The first author Dr Sanne Alsters, also in the Department of Medicine, who carried out the genetic tests, said: ""Finding a genetic cause for the patient's problems has helped her and her family to understand and manage her condition better. We can also look at members of her family with one abnormal copy of the gene, to see they are affected in more subtle ways that could increase their risk of obesity."" Professor Blakemore said genetic tests should be widely available for patients with severe obesity. ""If people are diagnosed with a genetic condition like this one, we can look for other possible symptoms, and offer genetic advice to other family members if they want this. Diagnosis is very valuable to the patient. It helps to set realistic expectations, and can help them get the best possible treatment,"" she said. ","Published: June 30, 2015"

While the West African Ebola epidemic has slowed since its peak last fall, the crisis simmers on; there were still 24 confirmed cases of Ebola reported in Guinea and Sierra Leone in the week ending June 14.Nurse Kim Sprayer manages the triage area of the Maforki Ebola Treatment Unit during the night shift on January 9, 2015 in Port Loko, Sierra Leone.Image: Rebecca E. Rollins / Partners In Health To fight Ebola, the first step is to determine which patients are sick with the disease and which with other illnesses with a similar presentation. To use the currently recommended molecular approach, laboratories must be built and samples of highly infectious blood must be drawn, often with unsafe needles and syringes, and then shipped over potentially great distances at substantial risk to the health care workers involved in the process. Then, clinicians and patients must wait for results sometimes for several days. These obstacles and delays prevent timely diagnosis and treatment, and also result in individuals without Ebola being admitted to holding units where they may become infected with the virus, the researchers said.  Simplifying the process and speeding up diagnosis could have a major impact,  said Nira Pollock, senior author of the paper and HMS assistant professor of medicine and pathology and associate medical director of the Infectious Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory at Boston Children s Hospital.Colorized micrograph of an Ebola virus virion.Image: CDC As the Ebola outbreak in West Africa began to surge in 2014, Pollock and Partners In Health researcher Jana Broadhurst worked with the research core of the HMS Department of Global Health and Social Medicine to reach out to teams around the world who were developing diagnostic tools that would enable clinicians to diagnose Ebola patients quickly. One candidate, the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test, developed by Corgenix, seemed like a promising tool. Working with colleagues at Partners In Health and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone, the HMS team was able to plug into an environment that allowed it to train local technicians to perform the test and help collect data for the study. The team at the Public Health England lab at Port Loko, where clinical samples were routinely sent for standard molecular diagnostic testing, were also key collaborators. Corgenix donated test kits to the HMS team. The field trial took place at two treatment centers operated by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone and supported by PIH, where 106 patients suspected of having Ebola were tested during February 2015 using the rapid diagnostic test (performed on a fingerstick blood sample at the point of care). The patients were also tested using the standard RT-PCR (performed on plasma in the laboratory). Both rapid diagnostic tests, on whole blood, and RT-PCR, on plasma, were also performed on 284 samples in the laboratory. The rapid diagnostic test detected all confirmed cases of Ebola that were positive by the benchmark test in both point-of-care and laboratory testing with sensitivity of 100 percent (identifying all patients with Ebola found by the benchmark method), and a specificity of 92 percent (few false positives). Surprisingly, the study also showed that the standard RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. Both tests failed to detect a small number of Ebola cases that had been detected by an alternative lab test that was more sensitive than the benchmark test but was not available for wide usage. All of the missed cases showed very low levels of virus. The authors caution that given the limitations of the performance of the benchmark RT-PCR reference test in patients with low levels of the virus, more research is needed to assess how the new rapid diagnostic test will perform in patients still in the early stages of Ebola virus disease. The ReEBOV test uses a drop of blood from a fingerstick performed with a safety lancet, which has a spring-loaded mechanism that prevents health care workers from receiving accidental needlesticks after the blood is sampled. The ReEBOV test works similarly to a home pregnancy test: the sample is applied to a treated strip, and if the sample is positive for Ebola, a colored line appears on the strip at a specific location. The researchers noted that it was essential to study the test in the field to see whether it worked in the challenging conditions that clinicians face in rural clinics and in Ebola treatment units in such places as Sierra Leone. For example, wearing the required personal protective equipment made it potentially difficult to read the test strip, so instead of having one clinician check results, the research team developed a method in which two clinicians checked each test, with a third stepping up in cases where the first two disagreed.  We re talking about a truly extreme environment here,  said study co-author Megan Murray, HMS professor of global health and social medicine and director of research at Partners In Health. Not only were there no electronic health records, but due to strict infection control measures, researchers were not permitted to take handwritten notes out of the treatment unit. Because the researchers had existing relationships with Partners In Health clinicians who had already built collaborative relationships with local caregivers, they were able to build on those relationships to create an integrated clinical and research team.  This is a powerful combination,  Murray said.  To get research that provides meaningful results, researchers need connections to the communities and health systems that they're trying to understand.  Once the researchers saw that the test was effective, they shared their findings with the Partners In Health clinical network, with other partners in Sierra Leone and West Africa, and with the other governmental and non-governmental organizations working to end the Ebola epidemic.  That s another advantage of working closely with clinical care delivery teams: they can help us get the word out when we find something that works,  Murray said.  Ultimately, public health and regulatory officials in each of the affected countries will decide how the test is used in clinical and surveillance efforts, taking into account guidance from WHO and FDA.","Published: June 30, 2015"

It is characterized by defective bone mineralization that can lead to deformity of bones and other skeletal abnormalities, as well as systemic complications such as profound muscle weakness, seizures, pain and respiratory failure leading to premature death in infants. LAL-d is a genetic, progressive, ultra-rare metabolic disease in which patients ranging from infants to adults experience chronic lipid accumulation causing multi-systemic organ damage and premature death. It is caused by genetic mutations that result in decreased LAL enzyme activity in the lysosomes across multiple body tissues, leading to the chronic build-up of fatty material in the liver, blood vessel walls and other tissues.","Published: June 30, 2015"

Invented by Microchips Biotech co-founders Michael Cima, the David H. Koch Professor of Engineering, and Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor, the microchips consist of hundreds of pinhead-sized reservoirs, each capped with a metal membrane, that store tiny doses of therapeutics or chemicals. An electric current delivered by the device removes the membrane, releasing a single dose. The device can be programmed wirelessly to release individual doses for up to 16 years to treat, for example, diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and osteoporosis. Now Microchips Biotech will begin co-developing microchips with Teva Pharmaceutical, the world s largest producer of generic drugs, to treat specific diseases, with licensing potential for other products. Teva paid $35 million up front, with additional milestone payments as the device goes through clinical trials before it hits the shelves.  Obviously, this is a huge validation of the technology,  Cima says.  A major pharmaceutical company sees how this technology can further their efforts to help patients.  Apart from providing convenience, Microchips Biotech says these microchips could also improve medication-prescription adherence   a surprisingly costly issue in the United States. A 2012 report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that Americans who don t stick to prescriptions rack up $100 billion to $289 billion annually in unnecessary health care costs from additional hospital visits and other issues. Failure to follow prescriptions, the study also found, causes around 125,000 deaths annually and up to 10 percent of all hospitalizations. While its first partnership is for treating chronic diseases, Microchips Biotech will continue work on its flagship product, a birth-control microchip, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that releases contraceptives and can be turned on and off wirelessly. Cima, who now serves on the Microchips Biotech board of directors with Langer, sees this hormone-releasing microchip as one of the first implantable  artificial organs    because it acts as a gland.  A lot of the therapies are trying to chemically trick the endocrine systems,  Cima says.  We are doing that with this artificial organ we created.  Wild ideas Inspiration for the microchips came in the late 1990s, when Langer watched a documentary on mass-producing microchips.  I thought to myself,  Wouldn t this be a great way to make a drug-delivery system?  Langer says. He brought this idea to Cima, a chip-making expert who was taken aback by its novelty.  But being out-of-this-world is not something that needs to stop anybody at MIT,  Cima adds.  In fact, that should be the criterion.  So in 1999, Langer, Cima, and then-graduate student John Santini PhD  99 co-founded MicroCHIPS, and invented a prototype for their microchip that was described in a paper published that year in Nature. (This entrepreneurial collaboration was the first of many for Cima and Langer over the next decade.) This dime-sized prototype contained only 34 reservoirs, each controlled by an individual wire connected to an external power source. At the time, they considered a broad range of practical, and somewhat fantastical, applications beyond drug delivery, including disease diagnostics and jewelry that could emit scents.  We were trying to find the killer application. We thought,  I have a hammer, what s the right nail to hit?  Cima says. For years, the technology underwent rigorous research and development at Microchips Biotech. But in 2011, Langer and Cima, and researchers from MicroCHIPS, conducted the microchips  first human trials to treat osteoporosis   this time with wireless capabilities. In that study, published in a 2012 issue of Science Translational Medicine, microchips were implanted into seven elderly women, delivering teriparatide to strengthen bones. Results indicated that the chips delivered doses comparable to injections   and did so more consistently   with no adverse side effects. After that, the Gates Foundation took interest.  It wasn t just a pie-in-the-sky idea anymore   we re really treating patients,  Cima says.  That really captures people s imaginations.  That study, combined with ongoing efforts in contraceptive-delivery microchips, led Cima to believe the microchips could someday, essentially, be considered the first artificial glands that could regulate potent hormones inside the body. This may sound like a wild idea   but Cima doesn t think so. Consider the thousands of people living today with pacemakers, he says.  Pacemakers are delivering an electrical signal, fixing the pace of a heart, or detecting if the heart is not beating correctly, and trying to stimulate it,  Cima says. The chip  sends an endocrine or chemical signal, instead of an electrical signal.  MEMS innovations Microchips Biotech made several innovations in the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing process to ensure the microchips could be commercialized. A major innovation was enabling final assembly of the microchips at room temperature with hermetic seals. Any intense heat during final assembly, with hermetic sealing, could destroy the drugs already loaded into the reservoirs   which meant common methods of welding and soldering were off-limits. To do so, Microchips Biotech modified a cold-welding  tongue and groove  process. This meant depositing a soft, gold alloy in patterns on the top of the chip to create tongues, and grooves on the base. By pressing the top and base pieces together, the tongues fit into the grooves, and plastically deforms to weld the metal together.  Each one of these reservoirs, until you open it, [must be] completely sealed from any contaminant in the environment,  Cima says.  There was no precedent for that.  The company has also found ways to integrate electronics into the microchips to shrink down the device. Moving forward, Langer adds, the company could refine the microchips to be even smaller, yet carry the same volume of drugs.  This means making the drugs take up more volume [than] the electrical and other components,  he says.  That s the next major challenge. ","Published: June 30, 2015"

The Saint Louis University study, which was conducted in animal models and in human tumor cells in the lab, showed that a drug developed by Burris and colleagues at Scripps Research Institute can stop cancer cells without causing damage to healthy cells or leading to other severe side effects.Thomas Burris, Ph.D., and Colin A. Flaveny, Ph.D., discuss their cancer research. Courtesy of Saint Louis University. The Warburg Effect Metabolism   the ability to use energy   is a feature of all living things. Cancer cells aggressively ramp up this process, allowing mutated cells to grow unchecked at the expense of surrounding tissue.  Targeting cancer metabolism has become a hot area over the past few years, though the idea is not new,  Burris said. Since the early 1900s, scientists have known that cancer cells prefer to use glucose as fuel even if they have plenty of other resources available. In fact, this is how doctors use PET (positron emission tomography) scan images to spot tumors. PET scans highlight the glucose that cancer cells have accumulated. This preference for using glucose as fuel is called the Warburg effect, or glycolysis. In his paper, Burris reports that the Warburg effect is the metabolic foundation of oncogenic (cancer gene) growth, tumor progression and metastasis as well as tumor resistance to treatment. Cancer s Goal: To Grow and Divide  Cancer cells have one goal: to grow and divide as quickly as possible. And, while there are a number of possible molecular pathways a cell could use to find food, cancer cells have a set of preferred pathways.  In fact, they are addicted to certain pathways,  Burris said.  They need tools to grow fast and that means they need to have all of the parts for new cells and they need new energy.   Cancer cells look for metabolic pathways to find the parts to grow and divide. If they don t have the parts, they just die,  said Burris.  The Warburg effect ramps up energy use in the form of glucose to make chemicals required for rapid growth and cancer cells also ramp up another process, lipogenesis, that lets them make their own fats that they need to rapidly grow.  If the Warburg effect and lipogenesis are key metabolic pathways that drive cancer progression, growth, survival, immune evasion, resistance to treatment and disease recurrence, then, Burris hypothesizes, targeting glycolysis and lipogenesis could offer a way to stop a broad range of cancers. Cutting off the Energy Supply Burris and his colleagues created a class of compounds that affect a receptor that regulates fat synthesis. The new compound, SR9243, which started as an anti-cholesterol drug candidate, turns down fat synthesis so that cells can t produce their own fat. This also impacts the Warburg pathway, turning cancer cells into more normal cells. SR9243 suppresses abnormal glucose consumption and cuts off cancer cells  energy supply. When cancer cells don t get the parts they need to reproduce through glucose or fat, they simply die. Because the Warburg effect is not a feature of normal cells and because most normal cells can acquire fat from outside, SR9243 only kills cancer cells and remains non-toxic to healthy cells. The drug also has a good safety profile; it is effective without causing weight loss, liver toxicity, or inflammation. Promising Results  So far, SR9243 has been tested in cultured cancer cells and in human tumor cells grown in animal models. Because the Warburg pathway is a feature of almost every kind of cancer, researchers are testing it on a number of different cancer models.  It works in a wide range of cancers both in culture and in human tumors developing in animal models,  Burris said.  Some are more sensitive to it than others. In several of these pathways, cells had been reprogramed by cancer to support cancer cell growth. This returns the metabolism to that of more normal cells.  In human tumors grown in animal models, Burris said,  It worked very well on lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers, and it worked to a lesser degree in ovarian and pancreatic cancers.  It also seems to work on glioblastoma, an extremely difficult to treat form of brain cancer, though it isn t able to cross the brain/blood barrier very effectively. The challenge for researchers in this scenario will be to find a way to allow the drug to cross this barrier, the body s natural protection for the brain, which can make it difficult for drug treatments to reach their target. And, in even more promising news, it appears that when SR9243 is used in combination with existing chemotherapy drugs, it increases their effectiveness, in a mechanism apart from SR9243 s own cancer fighting ability.","Published: June 30, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-genetic-form-of-obesity-and-diabetes-discovered-202615,New Genetic Form of Obesity and Diabetes Discovered Scientists have discovered a new inherited form of obesity and type   diabetes in humans  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A large number of genes are involved in regulating body weight, and there are now over 30 genes known in which people with harmful changes in DNA sequence become extremely overweight. Similarly, there are a number of genes that can, when altered, cause type 2 diabetes. These conditions are inherited through families in exactly the same way as disorders such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. It is unclear what proportion of severe obesity and type 2 diabetes is caused by genetic disease. Researchers at Imperial College London discovered the new defect by sequencing the DNA of an extremely obese young woman and members of her family. In addition to an increased appetite leading to severe weight problems from childhood, she had type 2 diabetes, learning difficulties, and reproductive problems.  They found that she had inherited two copies of a harmful genetic change that meant she could not make a protein called carboxypeptidase-E (CPE). This is an enzyme that is important in the proper processing of a number of hormones and brain transmitters controlling appetite, insulin and other hormones important in the reproductive system. Studies have previously shown that CPE deficiency causes obesity, diabetes, and impaired memory in mice, but no humans with the condition have been found before. CPE deficiency is a recessive condition, so a person would need to inherit the altered genetic sequence from both parents to be affected. The study was funded by the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre and Diabetes UK. Professor Alex Blakemore, who led the study, said: ""There are now an increasing number of single-gene causes of obesity and diabetes known. We don't know how many more have yet to be discovered, or what proportion of the severely obese people in our population have these diseases - it is not possible to tell just by looking.  ""These are serious disorders that affect the body's ability to regulate hunger and fullness signals. They are inherited in the just same way as other genetic diseases and the sufferers should not be stigmatised for their condition. They should be offered genetic counselling and specialised lifelong support to allow them as healthy a life as possible."" The patient was clinically evaluated by consultant endocrinologist Dr Tony Goldstone, who runs a specialist genetics obesity clinic at Hammersmith Hospital. The patient's parents are cousins, giving her a relatively high likelihood of inheriting the same genetic change from both parents. She had an older brother with similar symptoms who died aged 21.  The first author Dr Sanne Alsters, who carried out the genetic tests, said: ""Finding a genetic cause for the patient's problems has helped her and her family to understand and manage her condition better. We can also look at members of her family with one abnormal copy of the gene, to see they are affected in more subtle ways that could increase their risk of obesity."" Professor Blakemore said genetic tests should be widely available for patients with severe obesity. ""If people are diagnosed with a genetic condition like this one, we can look for other possible symptoms, and offer genetic advice to other family members if they want this. Diagnosis is very valuable to the patient. It helps to set realistic expectations, and can help them get the best possible treatment,"" she said.","Published: June 30, 2015"

The project signals ELC Group s entry into the pharmaceutical development market. The vaccine development will be overseen by a specialist R&D team at ELC Group, including regulatory vaccines experts who have worked on and regulated a number of key worldwide paediatric vaccines. The highly experience team includes a number of current advisers to the World Health Organization. ELC Group is working with pre-clinical partners to carry out toxicity and immunogenicity testing, and is harnessing innovative new techniques to create the novel vaccine. ELC Group will also be responsible for setting up the regulatory pathway to ensure a smooth transition to market and approval from international regulators. The market value of the project assigned to ELC Group is an estimated 1 million Euros. According to World Health Organization figures (2014), the global incidence rate of influenza is estimated at 5%-10% in adults and 20%-30% in children. Illnesses can result in hospitalization and death mainly among high-risk groups (the very young, elderly or chronically ill). Worldwide, annual epidemics rates are currently estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250, 000 to 500, 000 deaths globally. Commenting on the vaccine development, ELC Group CEO Marco Rubinstein said:  We are very excited to be moving into the pharmaceutical development market with this key launch project, targeting an important therapeutic area.

The research, conducted at EMBL Heidelberg, measured and mapped how cells in very early stage embryos bond tightly together. The scientists also discovered a cellular behaviour that hadn t been observed before: cells in the embryo  dance , each one making the same rhythmic movement. The focus of the study was a stage of development known as compaction, which takes place when the embryo has eight cells. Compaction changes the embryo from a loosely attached group of cells to a closely bonded single entity. During compaction - which takes around 10 hours - the cells change shape to create the overall form of the embryo, increasing the area of contact between them. Using a new method, the researchers were able to measure the forces required to change the shape of the cells as compaction progressed. Being able to chart the tension within the embryo without destroying it meant they were able to investigate which cellular process was the main driver behind the compaction process. The first contender was a process known as adhesion. This is controlled by E-cadherin, an adhesion molecule on the cell surface that sticks cells together,  zipping up  the two surfaces as the molecules attach to each other. Earlier research had shown that when adhesion was blocked, compaction did not take place. The second contender was cell contraction, a process controlled by myosin, a type of motor protein that also causes contractions in muscle fibres. Myosin  walks  on tracks formed by another protein, actin. Every cell has a layer of actin underneath its membrane, and myosin contracts this cortical layer, controlling the tension of the cell surface. The EMBL Heidelberg team had also established that compaction did not take place if a cell s ability to contract was blocked. Postdoctoral researcher and first author, Jean-L on Ma tre, explains:  By measuring the tensions of the cells when each cellular process was blocked, we were able to prove it was a contraction that pulls the cells together to compact the embryo, rather than adhesion acting as a glue to  stick  them together. Adhesion is obviously important, but it appears to work as an anchor, rather than an engine of the compaction process.  This discovery was made possible by combining biological expertise from the group led by Takashi Hiiragi with that of the physicists working in the N d l c group. Herv  Turlier explains:  The research showed that it was the increased tension at the outer surface of the embryo that drives the compaction, rather than the relaxation of the cell to cell contacts. In fact, the changing ratio between these two tensions now provides us with a simple way to portray the compaction process despite the complex biological mechanisms taking place.  At the same time as compaction but on a shorter timescale, the team observed that the cells start to  dance . The  dance  is caused by a wave of contraction that bends the surface of the cell, traveling round it every 80 seconds.  We ve no idea at the moment if this  dance  is important,  says Hiiragi.  All we know is that it happens at the same time as compaction and is controlled by the same process.  Embryonic cells in other animals are known to pulse every 80 seconds, but this particular form of the movement hasn t been observed before. Further research will hopefully unveil the details underlying this peculiar phenomenon.","Published: June 30, 2015"

These compounds are called secondary metabolites. They are designed to protect their bacterial host and attack its enemies, so they often have the right kind of activity to serve as the basis for effective new drugs. In fact, many antibiotics and anticancer compounds in clinical use are either secondary metabolites or their derivatives. In a proof-of-concept test of the fight-club procedure, the research team headed by Associate Professor of Chemistry Brian Bachmann and Stevenson Professor of Chemistry John McLean discovered a promising new class of natural compounds that exhibit anti-cancer activity. Bacteria represent a vast untapped reservoir of biologically active compounds. There are an estimated five million trillion trillion bacterial cells on earth. They come in an astounding variety with the best estimate of the number of distinct species ranging from 120,000 to 150,000. Analysis of microbial genomes has shown that individual bacteria carry the blueprints for hundreds of secondary metabolites. However, biologists have had a hard time either getting bacteria to produce them or synthesizing them directly so they can assess their therapeutic value. That s where the  fight club  approach comes in. Research associate Dagmara Derewacz came up with the idea of applying the analytical tools the Bachmann and McLean groups had developed to analyze what happens when microbes compete.  It s a  shoot first and ask questions later approach,  said Bachmann,  which is opposite of the traditional approach to natural products drug discovery.  The first microorganism the scientists put in the ring was Nocardiopsis, a bacteria that is found in the soil. They picked this particular strain because when its genome was sequenced it revealed the presence of 20 gene clusters that carry blueprints for making secondary metabolites. In order to stimulate the bacteria to produce some of these novel compounds the researchers matched it with four challengers: the common gut organism Escherichia coli; Bacillus subtilis, a well-studied model organism; Tsukamurella pulmonis, which infects people with compromised immune systems; and, Rhodococcus wratislaviensis, which degrades hydrocarbons. The researchers  co-cultured  Nocoardiopsis separately with each of the challenger microorganisms.  What Brett Covington in my lab found and quantified was that in every case that the product   the co-culture   was more than the sum of the two monocultures,  said Bachmann.  The co-cultures contained significantly more kinds of biological molecules than the two monocultures combined.  The researchers were able to make this determination because of an advanced analytical chemistry technique capable of simultaneously identifying thousands of different biological compounds, which McLean and colleagues have helped pioneer. This technology, called ion mobility-mass spectrometry, combines ion mobility spectroscopy that separates and identifies electrically charged molecules by the speed with which they travel through a gas-filled column with mass spectrometry that precisely  weighs  individual molecules by how quickly they travel a given distance in the absence of gas. The chemists estimate that the cell co-cultures contain somewhere between 20,000 to 50,000 different kinds of molecules. Ion mobility   mass spectroscopy separates these molecules based on their size-to-weight ratio, which naturally sorts them into different regions that correspond to proteins, lipids, sugars, metabolites etc., and allows them to identify about 2,500 metabolites in each co-culture. One of the biggest technical challenges stems from the wide range in concentrations of different molecules: the bacteria produce some compounds by the dozen but make others by the billions. The secondary metabolites that the researchers were looking for are generally present in relatively low concentrations, so they had to come up with a method that helped them identify these compounds based on their qualities not their quantities. They call the method they developed  self-organizing metabolomics maps  or SOM.  SOM is similar to the process Amazon uses to make recommendations for the products they sell,  said McLean. Amazon monitors your Internet page views, your purchasing history and other information they have about you and make a pattern out of the data. It puts your pattern on a tile and does the same for its millions of other customers. Next, it shuffles these tiles around until neighboring tiles share the most similar patterns. Then they recommend your last purchase to your neighbors and their last purchases to you.  The SOMs we are using here do much the same thing. They take the patterns in the data we have about all these molecules and match those that behave similarly,  said McLean. This procedure allowed the chemists to discover a new member of a class of biomolecules with broad ranging activity produced when Nocoardiopsis comes into contact with Rhodococcus wratislaviensis. The scientists named this new compound ciromicin, after a Latin word meaning war/cite/disturb/invoke. Circomicn s structure is similar to that of several FDA-approved antibiotics. The new compound has demonstrated both anti-tumor activity in vitro and the capability to modulate genes involved in programmed cell death.  In the past, we ve experimented with a number of ways to get bacteria to produce their secondary metabolites, including poisoning them with antibiotics and exposing them to rare earths, but the fight club approach is the most effective method we ve found, by far,  said McLean.","Published: June 30, 2015"

Shota Atsumi, a chemistry professor at UC Davis, aims to address that through  synthetic biology:  designing and building new biochemical pathways within living cells, based on existing pathways from other living things. Atsumi and colleagues Yohei Toshiro and Shuchi Desai describe building a new pathway that lets the bacterium, E. coli, feed on both sugar (glucose) and acetate, a common waste material from biomass, to make isobutyl acetate. This product can be used as the basis for flavoring agents, solvents and fuels. The original pathway starts with glucose, which is converted into both isobutanol (via a pyruvate intermediate) and into acetyl-coenzyme A, a common building block in biochemistry used for making biochemicals such as proteins, fats and alcohols, among other things.  The theoretical maximum carbon yield from this pathway is 67 percent, which is lower than chemists would like to see. Atsumi s team engineered E. coli so that they could scavenge acetate to make acetyl-CoA while using glucose to make isobutanol. The new pathway raises the theoretical maximum carbon yield of isobutyl acetate to 75 percent. The process might be further improved by using an acetate-assimilation pathway from other soil bacteria that are better at living off acetate than E. coli, the authors note. Because acetyl-CoA is such an important material for making other biological molecules, direct acetate assimilation could have wide application in biotechnology.","Published: June 29, 2015"

The report, published online in the journal Stem Cell Reports, identifies two enzymes that alter the expression of certain genes needed for embryonic cells to differentiate and become endothelial cells. The enzymes work by an  epigenetic  modification   a chemical change to DNA, or certain proteins that interact with DNA, that changes the activity of genes without changing the DNA itself. Changes to the proteins around which DNA is wound, called histones, can up-regulate the expression of genes by exposing them to the cellular machinery that translates their DNA.  Epigenetic modifications to histones can trigger the activation of a large number of genes simultaneously, instead of regulating one gene at a time,  says Jalees Rehman, associate professor of medicine and pharmacology at UIC, and an author on the paper.  We wanted to see if we could identify epigenetic regulators of stem cell differentiation   a highly complex process, involving the transition of a cell that can form any type of tissue early on in development, into one that is locked in to producing only one cell type.  One of the ways histones are modified is by the addition or removal of chemical tags called methyl groups by enzymes. The UIC research team, led by Asrar Malik, professor and head of pharmacology in the UIC College of Medicine, studied mice to look at how several of these enzymes, known as histone demethylases, alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells undergoing transformation into mature endothelial cells. They found two demethylases, KDM4A and KDM4C, were produced in abundance during the transformation. The researchers then turned to zebra fish, depleting the enzymes in fish embryos. Without the two enzymes, the embryos were unable to form blood vessels. Depleting KDM4A alone had a greater effect than did KDM4C, suggesting that it plays an earlier role in blood vessel cell development. The genes that were regulated by the enzymes turned out to be promoters, or genes that turn on other genes, and were specific to endothelial cells. A more complete understanding of the blood-vessel development pathway will require further investigation, Rehman said.  We only looked at a few of the genes activated by the epigenetic switches that guide stem cells into becoming endothelial cells,  he said.  Identifying additional genes activated by these switches, as well as gene pathways that are turned off during these transitions, will help shed more light on how stem cells carefully orchestrate a complex array of molecular signals which ultimately decide their fates.

Neural fundamentals: Sex differences in the nervous system The brain is an intricate, plastic organ and scientists are only beginning to understand that differences between male and female brains are extremely complex and influenced by genetics, physiology, experience, and learning.   Brain scans of passengers who experienced nightmare flight offer new clues about trauma memory A group of passengers who thought they were going to die when their plane ran out of fuel over the Atlantic Ocean in August, 2001 have had their brains scanned while recalling the terrifying moments to help science better understand trauma memories and how they are processed in the brain.   Rare neurons enable mental flexibility Behavioral flexibility -- the ability to change strategy when the rules change -- is controlled by specific neurons in the brain, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) have confirmed. Cholinergic interneurons are rare -- they make up just one to two percent of the neurons in the striatum, a key part of the brain involved with higher-level decision-making. Scientists have suspected they play a role in changing strategies, and researchers at OIST recently confirmed this with experiments.   The challenge of measuring a bird brain In research, sometimes setting out to demonstrate one concept actually results in proving something entirely different. It's important to be flexible. Take, for example, Corina Logan, whose work focuses on the cognitive abilities of the great-tailed grackle, a member of the blackbird family. A junior research fellow at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)'s SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind when she conducted her research, Logan sought to find a way to accurately approximate the brain size of live grackles by measuring their heads rather than the inside of their skulls.   Research sheds light on how neurons control muscle movement Stanford University researchers studying how the brain controls movement in people with paralysis, related to their diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have found that groups of neurons work together, firing in complex rhythms to signal muscles about when and where to move.","Published: June 27, 2015"

Peter Carlsson, professor in genetics at the University of Gothenburg, and his research team are publishing new research findings in the journal Developmental Cell about how the blood-brain barrier develops and what makes the capillaries in the brain different from small blood vessels in other organs. The brain s smallest blood vessels differ from those in other organs in that the capillary walls are much more compact. The nerve cells in the brain get the nutrients they need by molecules actively being transported from the blood, instead of passively leaking out from the blood vessels. This blood-brain barrier is vital, because it enables strict control over the substances with which the brain s nerve cells come into contact. It has a protective function that if it fails, increases the risk of stroke and other complications. The smallest blood vessels, the capillaries, have a type of cell called pericytes. These are essential to the development of the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes are also found in other organs, and researchers have previously been unable to find out what gives the brain s pericytes this unique ability. The Gothenburg research team has found that the brain s pericytes contain a protein, FoxF2, which is not present in the pericytes of other organs, and which coordinates the changes that make the blood vessels compact. FoxF2 is needed in order for the blood-brain barrier to form during foetal development.  Mice that have too little or too much FoxF2 develop various types of defects in the brain s blood vessels,  explains Peter Carlsson, professor at the University of Gothenburg s Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology. In humans, researchers have noted that major changes in a region of chromosome 6 have been associated with an increased risk of stroke, but it has not been known which of the genes in the area are responsible for this risk.  The FoxF2 gene is an extremely interesting candidate, as it is located right in the middle of this region, and research is under way now in collaboration with clinical geneticists to investigate the extent to which variations in the FoxF2 gene affect people s risk of suffering a stroke,  says Peter Carlsson.

However, authors conclude the connection may have more to do with anti-hypertension medication than high blood pressure itself.  It s likely that this protective effect is coming from antihypertensive drugs,  said co-author John Kauwe, associate professor of biology at Brigham Young University (BYU).  These drugs are already FDA approved. We need to take a serious look at them for Alzheimer s prevention.  The study, published in PLoS Medicine, analyzed genetic data from 17,008 individuals with Alzheimer s and 37,154 people without the disease. Data came from the Alzheimer s Disease Genetics Consortium and the International Genomics of Alzheimer s Project. BYU researchers worked with scholars from Cambridge, the University of Washington and several other institutions on the massive study. BYU s role was to flex its muscles in supercomputing and bioinformatics. With the help of BYU s supercomputer, Kauwe and undergraduate student Kevin Boehme pieced together 32 data sets for the analysis. The research team looked for links between Alzheimer s disease and a number of health conditions including diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol but only found a significant association between higher systolic blood pressure and reduced Alzheimer s risk. (A weak connection between smoking and Alzheimer s also surfaced).  Our results are the opposite of what people might think,  said fellow co-author Paul Crane, a University of Washington associate professor of internal medicine.  It may be that high blood pressure is protective, or it may be that something that people with high blood pressure are exposed to more often, such as antihypertensive medication, is protecting them from Alzheimer s disease.  University of Cambridge Senior Investigator Scientist Robert Scott led the study, which used  Mendelian randomization  to find if the risk factors (BMI, insulin resistance, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes) for Alzheimer s had a causal impact. Mendelian randomization uses subjects  genetics as a proxy for a randomized clinical trial.  This is to date the most authoritative paper looking at causal relationships between Alzheimer s disease and these potentially modifiable factors,  Kauwe said.  In terms of the number of samples, it can t get bigger at this point.  Brigham Young University   press release Scott RA et al.

The hypothesis has been a major driver of AD research for more than 20 years.  However, in a new study published this week online in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease, researchers at University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System suggest the picture is not so clear-cut, reporting that early indicators or biomarkers of AD development are not fixed in a specific sequence.  Our current ability to identify early stages of AD is limited by the focus on amyloid accumulation and the expectation that biomarkers follow the same timeline for all individuals,  said Emily C. Edmonds, PhD, a senior postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and first author of the study. But, Edmonds said,  AD is complex in the sense that there may be different neurobiological pathways leading to expression of the disease. Our findings suggest that the number of abnormal biomarkers and cognitive markers an individual possesses, without regard to the temporal sequence, is most predictive of future decline.   Preclinical AD  is a very early stage of AD prior to the appearance of diagnosable symptoms. Current National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for preclinical AD describe a disease progression that begins with accumulation of amyloid-beta, leading to neurodegeneration, cognitive decline and, eventually, diagnosable AD. In their study, researchers classified 570 cognitively normal participants in the Alzheimer s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative according to NIA-AA criteria, and then separately examined the participants based upon the presence and number of abnormal biological and cognitive markers associated with preclinical AD. They found that neurodegeneration alone was 2.5 times more common than amyloid accumulation alone at baseline measurements. They then examined only those participants who progressed to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, which is an at-risk cognitive state of AD. They found that it was most common to show neurodegeneration as the first sign of early AD, and equally common to show amyloid accumulation or subtle cognitive decline as the first sign. Edmonds said that the findings underscore the need to improve identification of persons at risk for AD through the use of multiple, diverse assessment tools. This includes sensitive learning and memory tests capable of reliably identifying cognitive changes at the earliest stages.  At present, it is much more common for assessment of cognition to be based on insensitive screening measures or reports of cognitive problems by patients or their family members,  said Edmonds.  These blunt screening tools can be very unreliable, which might explain why cognitive decline has traditionally been viewed as occurring later in the disease process. The integration of sensitive neuropsychological measures with assessment of biomarkers of AD can enhance our ability to more accurately identify individuals who are at risk for future progression to AD.

Now imagine that half of the iron in that object owes its existence to bacteria living two and a half billion years ago.  That's the upshot of a study published this week. The findings have meaning for fields as diverse as mining and the search for life in space. Clark Johnson, a professor of geoscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and former postdoctoral researcher Weiqiang Li examined samples from the banded iron formation in Western Australia. Banded iron is the iron-rich rock found in ore deposits worldwide, from the proposed iron mine in Northern Wisconsin to the enormous mines of Western Australia.  These ancient deposits, up to 150 meters deep, were begging for explanation, says Johnson.  Scientists thought the iron had entered the ocean from hot, mineral-rich water released at mid-ocean vents that then precipitated to the ocean floor. Now Johnson and Li show that half of the iron in banded iron was metabolized by ancient bacteria living along the continental shelves. The banding was thought to represent some sort of seasonal changes. The UW-Madison researchers found long-term swings in the composition, but not variations on shorter periods like decades or centuries.  The study began with precise measurements of isotopes of iron and neodymium using one of the world's fastest lasers, housed in the UW-Madison geoscience department. (Isotopes, forms of an atom that differ only by weight, are often used to ""fingerprint"" the source of various samples.)  Bursts of light less than one-trillionth of a second long vaporized thin sections of the sample without heating the sample itself. ""It's like taking an ice cream scoop and quickly pulling out material before it gets heated,"" Johnson explains. ""Heating with traditional lasers gave spurious results."" It took three years to perfect the working of the laser and associated mass spectrometry instruments, Li says.  Previous probes of the source of banded iron had focused on iron isotopes. ""There has been debate about what the iron isotopes were telling us about the source,"" Li says. ""Adding neodymium changed that picture and gave us an independent measure of the amount coming from shallow continental waters that carried an isotopic signature of life."" The idea that an organism could metabolize iron may seem strange today, but Earth was very different 2.5 billion years ago. With little oxygen in the atmosphere, many organisms derived energy by metabolizing iron instead of oxygen.  Biologists say this process ""is really deep in the tree of life, but we've had little evidence from the rock record until now,"" Johnson says. ""These ancient microbes were respiring iron just like we respire oxygen. It's a hard thing to wrap your head around, I admit."" The current study is important in several ways, Johnson says. ""If you are an exploration geologist, you want to know the source of the minerals so you know where to explore."" The research also clarifies the evolution of our planet - and of life itself - during the ""iron-rich"" era 2.5 billion years ago. ""What vestiges of the iron-rich world remain in our metabolism?"" Johnson asks. ""It's no accident that iron is an important part of life, that early biological molecules may have been iron-based."" NASA has made the search for life in space a major focus and sponsors the UW-Madison Astrobiology Institute, which Johnson directs. Recognizing unfamiliar forms of life is a priority for the space agency. The study reinforces the importance of microbes in geology. ""This represents a huge change,"" Johnson says. ""In my introductory geochemistry textbook from 1980, there is no mention of biology, and so every diagram showing what minerals are stable at what conditions on the surface of the Earth is absolutely wrong.""  Research results like these affect how classes are taught, Johnson says. ""If I only taught the same thing, I would be teaching things that are absolutely wrong. If you ever wonder why we combine teaching and research at this university, geomicrobiology gives you the answer. It has completely turned geoscience on its ear.""","Published: June 26, 2015"

They expected epigenetic effects to have a greater effect on BMI while height would mainly have a genetic influence. True to expectations, the researchers found that the methylation profile scores they generated didn't contribute to variance in height, while they did for BMI. Further, the methylation profile scores and genetic predictors worked in an additive fashion to improve BMI prediction. ""The BMI results suggest that combining genetic and epigenetic information might have greater utility for complex-trait prediction,"" Visscher and his colleagues wrote in their paper. Visscher and his team performed methylome-wide association studies for height and BMI in a discovery set of 1,366 people from two Scottish birth cohorts with average ages of 79 and 69, respectively. They then validated their findings in a cohort comprised of 750 Dutch adults with an average age of 45. From this, they associated nine probes from the Scottish set with BMI and five in the Dutch cohort. Using these probes, the researchers developed methylation profile scores   a weighted sum of methylation levels at the associated CpG sites   in the validation cohort based on observed CpG associations in the discovery set for BMI. For height, only one probe in the Dutch cohort associated with the phenotype, so to develop a height-profile score, they had to loosen the strictness of their significance threshold. Based on these scores, Visscher and his team gauged how well DNA methylation could explain height and BMI. For height, the methylation profile scores explained  only some 0.31 percent and 0.76 percent of variation in the Scottish and Dutch cohorts, while the genetic profile scores explained 18.5 percent and 19.8 percent of height variation in the respective cohorts. BMI, on the other hand, was influenced more by epigenetics. According to the researchers, the methylation-profile scores could explain 6.9 percent and 4.9 percent of the variation in BMI in the Scottish and Dutch cohorts, respectively. Genetic variation scores, meanwhile, could explain 8.0 percent and 9.4 percent of the variation in BMI in the Scottish and Dutch cohorts, respectively. The genetic variation scores   also weighted sums, though this time of the associated effect alleles of associated SNPs   was based on data from the most recent BMI and height meta-GWAS conducted by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium. When the researchers combined the methylation and genetic scores in an additive model, it could explain 14.0 percent and 13.6 percent of the variation in BMI in the Scottish and Dutch cohorts, respectively. How well the BMI methylation profiles scores could explain variation in BMI varied by the population used to generate those scores, with a noticeable influence by average age of the cohorts. For instance, BMI methylation profile scores generated in the Scottish cohort, which had an older average age, couldn't explain any variation in adolescents from the Brisbane Systems Genetics Study, a cohort of 403 individuals with a mean age of 14, even after BMI was adjusted for sex and age. Similarly, the profile scores generated from the middle-aged subset of the Dutch cohort could explain 3.6 percent of the BMI variation in the Brisbane group, but a younger subset of the Dutch cohort could explain 5.4 percent of the BMI variation in the Brisbane group. ""Combined, the results suggest that these differences might be due to the direct effect of more prolonged exposure to environmental factors in older individuals, or the fact that older individuals are 'exposed' to the phenotype for longer, and therefore might show larger effects on methylation due to reverse causation,"" the researchers said. They noted that their study had a number of limitations, including small sample sizes and a reliance on blood-based samples for DNA methylation study rather than of tissue-specific samples. Still, ""we have shown that inter-individual differences in environment or lifestyle are partly reflected in DNA-methylation data, and therefore DNA-methylation profiles have the potential to significantly improve complex-trait prediction over and above that of genetic predictors,"" the researchers said.","Published: June 26, 2015"

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson believes that a radical new approach to life sciences investment is needed if London and the rest of the country is to maximise the full economic and health benefit of its world-leading research and development base. Against that backdrop, today s City Hall event will bring together leading figures in industry, finance and research. They will discuss positioning London as a test bed for innovative new funding models that tackle structural problems within life sciences investment and create a large pool of patient capital that supports long-term drug development and company growth. Experts from organisations including Lilly, Pfizer, Imperial Innovations, Silicon Valley Bank, European Investment Bank and JP Morgan will explore options. These include the potential to establish a  megafund  of up to  10bn created by a mix of debt and equity finance. Another option up for consideration today is to take advantage of a programme set up jointly by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank that is set to make more than  24 billion available over the next seven years. The meeting is being hosted by the Mayor s Office in conjunction with MedCity, launched by the Mayor last year to drive forward life sciences research, development, entrepreneurship and commercialisation. The event is supported by the European Investment Bank, a major European funder of research, development and innovation investment. Boris Johnson said:  London is one of the most powerful scientific discovery engines in the world, home to an incredible cornucopia of research, medical and financial pre-eminence. By hosting this conference we hope to harness our role as a global financial centre that will bring more life-saving drugs to market and deliver a huge boost to the economy.  Eliot Forster, Executive Chair of MedCity, said:  If you compare the UK to other leading life sciences hubs, we are extremely competitive   we have huge innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial drive, and we are increasingly agile in translating exciting research into spin-out companies. Capital is a key ingredient that grows those companies and brings therapies to market, and at the moment we simply don t have enough of it. If we want to develop another GSK or AstraZeneca, if we want to get a full return on the investment we put into our research base, and if we want better therapies more quickly, this is an issue we have to address.  The UK s medical and scientific base is regarded as one of the world s best, with the London-Oxford-Cambridge  golden triangle  alone home to universities consistently rated in the world top 10 and five out of seven of the UK s seven Academic Health Sciences Centres. However, UK companies face particular challenges in accessing finance at certain stages of development, including taking promising late-stage research into clinical development, and for phase III trials and beyond. It can cost up to  15m to reach phase II clinical trial results and  20m to reach small phase III trial results, and take an average of 10 to 15 years to bring a medicine to market. Drug discovery and development also has a high failure rate, meaning that it is perceived as a riskier prospect for investors compared to other technology sectors.  More large pools of capital to fund opportunities in the sector and more long-term  patient  investment are needed for the UK to develop a crucial tier of mid-sized life sciences companies, which it is currently lacking. To tackle these challenges and create an environment in which life sciences companies can grow and successfully commercialise the UK s cutting-edge research, today s event will explore innovative new funding models for drug discovery and development. These include establishing  megafunds , potentially in the long run of up to  10bn, created using a mix of debt and equity finance that would be able to invest simultaneously in multiple different drugs at different stages of development. By pooling various drug development projects in a single investment portfolio, the overall risk would be lower, with a much higher chance of bringing a minority of successful projects to fruition, which would more than compensate for the potential failure of the remainder. This model is well known in the financial services sector, and one focus of today s event will be to tackle the key differences in scale and complexity of life science. A  megafund  could bring together investors who would not normally invest in biomedical research and drug development. In return they could have a small percentage of the royalties from successful products or licensing revenues that result. Another option would be to make use of the new InnovFin financing and advisory programme set up jointly by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank. The initiative helps to share best practice between innovation and life science focused companies seeking to attract public and private investment in life sciences. It is expected that InnovFin will provide more than  17 billion of new financing for research and innovation across Europe in the next five years. Jonathan Taylor, European Investment Bank Vice President said:  Across Europe the European Investment Bank supports investment by innovation, life science and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes as well as backing efforts to discover new treatments, such as a vaccine for Ebola. In the UK the EIB is backing investment by world-leading universities and firms such as Imperial Innovations in London and the IP Group to develop innovative products and techniques. By reducing the risk for other investors the EIB can help to catalyse engagement from other sources of finance. Our support for innovation and investment to strengthen European competitiveness is also expected to increase once the  315 billion European Fund for Strategic Investment s is fully operational. Companies considering innovation investment should get in touch with the EIB to see if we can provide financial or best-practice support through our advisory services in any way.  Cathrin Petty, JP Morgan, said:  The UK has world-leading technology and research capability, and MedCity is putting in place the infrastructure and resources to encourage investment into these new companies that are being created. The convergence of this should attract the necessary investment to create the next generation of life sciences companies in the UK, just have we have seen in the tech sector. There is also the opportunity to bring together these tech and life sciences disciplines and create truly disruptive health companies. This investment could be of great significance to the UK economy over the next decade.  Dr. Belen Carrillo-Rivas, Pfizer said:  Rare disease research is at a critical inflection point in the UK; given that the scientific and technical expertise exists in the UK potentially  to make major breakthroughs in understanding the molecular basis of rare diseases. We hope that discussions such as these that the Mayor s office is hosting can help support scientific advances. We look forward to a future where the UK continues to contribute to the development of innovative medicines and sees patients benefitting from the next generation of transformative therapeutics which are so urgently needed.  Dr. Tim Luker, Eli Lilly and Company Ltd said:  Lilly welcomes City Hall s ambition to put London at the forefront of biomedical research, investment and funding.   Lilly is a global company with a commitment to innovation and over 60 years research investment in the UK.  We believe that only though research collaboration and new funding models can we speed the discovery of new medicines to treat the world s most challenging medical conditions.  Nooman Haque, Director of UK Life Sciences & Healthcare, Silicon Valley Bank, said, ""Silicon Valley Bank provides life science companies of all stages with innovative financing tools that complement traditional venture capital and public finance. With a fully dedicated UK team and access to a global network of professionals, we are working alongside leading UK life science companies and their investors to provide them with financial solutions that support their ambitions to bring much-needed therapies to the market."" Additional options for incentivising a more patient approach to investment being considered include tax incentives for investors who hold onto shares for more than 10 years, to encourage them to behave more like owners and grow larger companies, and capital gains incentives where lower capital gains tax is paid the longer it takes to get a return.","Published: June 26, 2015"

The mode of action of idebenone provides a clear biochemical and medical rationale and the clinical data demonstrate that vision of affected patients can substantially improve upon treatment with Raxone. This recommendation is a landmark in mitochondrial disease research worldwide and will undoubtedly spur further research in this direction."" ""We are very excited about the CHMP's positive opinion, which recognizes the urgent medical need for a treatment for this devastating disease,"" stated Thomas Meier, PhD, CEO of Santhera. ""We can now execute on our plans to ensure Raxone is made available to patients in the EU as soon as the European Commission marketing authorization is received."" The CHMP based its recommendation for Raxone on data from the randomized, placebo controlled RHODOS trial, Santhera's Expanded Access Program, and comparative natural history data from a comprehensive case record survey. The Committee considered that the totality of the data provided for an orphan disease as severe as LHON with no available treatment options warranted a recommendation for approval under Exceptional Circumstances. Santhera has undertaken to gather additional long-term efficacy and safety data in LHON patients as post-authorization measures. The positive opinion by the CHMP for Raxone will now be forwarded to the European Commission (EC) for the adoption of a decision on EU-wide marketing authorization, applicable to all 28 member states of the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Raxone has orphan designation which provides 10 years of market exclusivity from the date of EC approval.","Published: June 26, 2015"

What s more, efforts to develop new antibiotics are not keeping pace with this growth in microbial resistance, resulting in a pressing need for new approaches to tackle bacterial infection. In a paper published online, researchers at MIT, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Harvard University reveal that they have developed a new means of killing harmful bacteria. The researchers have engineered particles, known as  phagemids,  capable of producing toxins that are deadly to targeted bacteria.Phagemid plasmids infect a targeted bacteria Bacteriophages   viruses that infect and kill bacteria   have been used for many years to treat infection in countries such as those in the former Soviet Union. Unlike traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics, these viruses target specific bacteria without harming the body s normal microflora. But bacteriophages can also cause potentially harmful side effects, according to James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT s Department of Biological Engineering and Institute of Medical Engineering and Science, who led the research.  Bacteriophages kill bacteria by lysing the cell, or causing it to burst,  Collins says.  But this is problematic, as it can lead to the release of nasty toxins from the cell.  These toxins can lead to sepsis and even death in some cases, he says. In previous research, Collins and his colleagues engineered bacteriophages to express proteins that did not actually burst the cells, but instead increased the effectiveness of antibiotics when delivered at the same time. To build on this earlier work, the researchers set out to develop a related technology that would target and kill specific bacteria, without bursting the cells and releasing their contents. The researchers used synthetic biology techniques to develop a platform of particles called phagemids. These particles infect bacteria with small DNA molecules known as plasmids, which are able to replicate independently inside a host cell. Once inside the cell, the plasmids are engineered to express different proteins or peptides   molecules made up of short chains of amino acids   that are toxic to the bacteria, Collins says.  We systematically tested different antimicrobial peptides and bacterial toxins, and demonstrated that when you combine a number of these within the phagemids, you can kill the great majority of cells within a culture,  he says. The expressed toxins are designed to disrupt different cellular processes, such as bacterial replication, causing the cell to die without bursting open. The phagemids will also only infect a specific species of bacteria, resulting in a highly targeted system, Collins says.  You can use this to kill off very specific species of bacteria as part of an infection therapy, while sparing the rest of the microbiome,  he says. When the researchers monitored the response of the bacteria to repeated reinfection with the phagemids, they did not witness signs of significant resistance to the particles.  This means you can do multiple rounds of delivery of the phagemids, in order to get a more effective therapy,  he says. This is in contrast to repeated infection with bacteriophages, where the researchers found that the bacteria did develop resistance over time. Although Collins acknowledges that bacteria will ultimately develop resistance to any stress that is placed upon them, the research suggests that it is likely to take them far longer to develop resistance to phagemids than to conventional bacteriophage therapy, he says. A  cocktail  of different phagemids could be given to patients to treat an unclassified infection, in a similar way to the broad-spectrum antibiotics used today. But they are more likely to be used in conjunction with rapid diagnostic tools, currently in development, which would allow physicians to treat specific infections, Collins says.  You would first run a fast diagnostic test to identify the bacteria your patient has, and then give the appropriate phagemid to kill off the pathogen,  he says. The researchers are planning to expand their platform by developing a broader range of phagemids. They have so far experimented with a set of phagemids specific to E. coli, but now hope to create particles capable of killing off pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and the cholera-causing bacterium Vibrio cholerea. The paper demonstrates that using synthetic biology to modify a gene in a phage to make it more toxic to a pathogen can lead to more effective antimicrobial particles than classical approaches, says Alfonso Jaramillo, a professor of synthetic biology at the University of Warwick, who was not involved in the research.  Combining synthetic genetic devices with phages as delivery vehicles allows a systematic approach to reprogram pathogenic bacteria for death,  Jaramillo explains.  The focus on nonreplicative phages is also very appropriate because those particles are more feasible for use in people, as they are not considered genetically modified organisms,  he says. The researchers have created an improved form of phage therapy that may become the antibiotics of the future, he adds.","Published: June 26, 2015"

The study will assess the safety and efficacy of gabapentin enacarbil (HORIZANT) in extended-release tablets for treating moderate to severe AUD. NIAAA is part of the National Institutes of Health. Gabapentin is already widely prescribed to treat pain conditions and epilepsy. HORIZANT contains gabapentin enacarbil, a prodrug of gabapentin that is converted to gabapentin in the body. A prodrug is an inactive form that is converted to an active form through metabolic processes. Gabapentin enacarbil is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of restless leg syndrome (RLS) and nerve pain caused by shingles. NIAAA is working in partnership with the biopharmaceutical company XenoPort, Inc., of Santa Clara, California, which will supply gabapentin enacarbil for the study.  This multi-site, well-controlled clinical trial will allow us to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of gabapentin enacarbil in treating alcohol use disorder,  said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of NIAAA.  Gabapentin has shown promising results in earlier clinical trials, and the development of new medications is an important component of our commitment to broaden the range of treatment options for people with AUD.  NIAAA will enroll 346 patients in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of gabapentin enacarbil in patients with AUD at 10 sites across the United States. The study will assess the safety and efficacy of 1200 mg of gabapentin enacarbil (administered in two daily doses of 600 mg), compared with placebo, to reduce drinking in patients who report four or more symptoms of AUD, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Eligible subjects will receive either gabapentin enacarbil or placebo for 26 weeks. The study will evaluate whether participants using the medication are more likely to abstain from heavy drinking during the last four weeks of treatment. In a recent study supported by NIAAA, researchers at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, found that alcohol dependent patients using gabapentin were more likely than those taking placebo to stop drinking or refrain from heavy drinking. Scientists at XenoPort designed gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets to address certain limitations of drug levels in the body, which may make it a more attractive treatment option for people with AUD. Alcohol use disorder affects about 16.6 million adults in the United States and has an estimated societal cost of $223.5 billion each year, primarily from lost productivity, but also from health care and property damage costs. Currently, three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating alcohol dependence: disulfram, an older drug that blocks the metabolism of alcohol and causes nausea; acamprosate, which helps support abstinence and can ease symptoms of withdrawal; and naltrexone, which can help people reduce heavy drinking.","Published: June 26, 2015"

This is very welcome news and could make a big difference if the data is easily searchable and organised well. There are all sorts of benefits in making more data freely available as more users will find new applications, spot errors we can fix and connect different data sets together to further the science and increase the number of applications.  Professor Campbell cited the development of soil apps by the James Hutton Institute as a successful example of access to open data.  We ve had a great response for example to our soil smartphone apps which let people locate their soil type and compare their soil quality to the Nationals Soils database to help manage soils better. One of our apps using the free data also allows you to calculate how much soil C is in your soil simply by taking a photograph. There are many more new possibilities if more people get access.   The James Hutton Institute is fully committed to open access and the number of scientific papers we publish in open access journals is increasing every year. This is a great way of democratising and sharing science as long as people are aware of the inevitable uncertainties that go with data and they interpret the data with rigour and care.  The Institute has abundant experience in soil and crop research and also hosts Scotland s National Soils Archive, which is a reference to the state of the soils in the past and is used to test new analyses and monitor changes in soil over time. To make this data available to land managers, farmers and the general public, the institute has developed two smartphone apps and a website in partnership with Ricardo-AEA for the Scottish Government.","Published: June 26, 2015"

The multi-centre open-label study will investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy of various dose regimens of resminostat in monotherapy or in combination with the S-1 chemotherapy in up to 44 Japanese patients with advanced pancreatic or biliary tract cancer. The main goal of the study is to determine the recommended regimen for subsequent Phase II trials in these indications. In Part 1 of the study, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of various dose regimens of resminostat in monotherapy and the resminostat/S-1 combination therapy will be determined in up to 24 patients. In Part 2, the tolerability and safety of the regimen/s selected in Part 1 will be further evaluated in 20 additional patients in order to determine the recommended regimen/s for subsequent Phase II studies. Furthermore, the study will investigate pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy criteria including best overall response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The overall development rationale behind the study is to test the epigenetic agent resminostat in further gastrointestinal indications and in particular in combination with the S-1 chemotherapy, which is approved for the treatment of pancreatic and biliary tract cancer in Japan. S-1 contains a prodrug of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU. Resminostat has already been tested clinically in a Phase I study in combination with the 5-FU-based FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen in Western patients with colorectal cancer. The administration of resminostat in combination with the standard FOLFIRI regimen was well tolerated without any dose limiting toxicity. Moreover in preclinical models, resminostat has shown first positive results in pancreatic and biliary tract cancer. Enno Spillner, Chief Executive Officer of 4SC AG, said: ""We very much appreciate that our partner Yakult Honsha has started developing resminostat in combination therapy with an established cancer drug in additional two gastrointestinal solid cancer indications in Japan. There is high unmet medical need in both pancreatic and biliary tract cancer. These new indications are a perfect match to the ongoing Phase II trials by Yakult investigating resminostat in combination therapies in the indications liver cancer (HCC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While Yakult is evaluating resminostat in a number of mostly gastrointestinal solid cancer indications in Asian patients, 4SC intends to focus, as the immediate next step, on developing resminostat in the heamatological indication of CTCL in Europe where we also see a high medical need and an attractive opportunity for a fast-to-market option for resminostat. We are currently preparing a European Phase II study in CTCL.""","Published: June 26, 2015"

One major reason is the disabling symptom referred to as freezing of gait (FoG)   brief episodes of an inability to step forward that typically occurs during gait initiation or when turning while walking. Patients who experience FoG often lose their independence, which has a direct effect on their already degenerating quality of life. In the absence of effective pharmacological therapies for FoG, technology-based solutions to alleviate the symptom and prolong the patients' ability to live independently are desperately being sought. CuPID is a project three years in the making and the product of an eight-member European Union-funded consortium including researchers at Tel Aviv University. It strives to provide personalized rehabilitation for patients with Parkinson's disease who experience FoG or other gait disturbances. CuPID is a home-based, personalized rehabilitation tool in the form of a smartphone app that harnesses wearable sensors, audio biofeedback, and external cueing to provide intense motivational training tailored to each patient. The results are monitored remotely by medical professionals, who provide quality care while enhancing patient compliance. The CuPID app just completed its pilot run and is being fine-tuned for more widespread use. It utilizes small sensors placed on a patients' shoes that measure a person s gait in ""real-time."" If certain deviations from a pre-set norm emerge, an audio message alerts the patient to change his or her walking pattern immediately to avoid a dangerous situation. ""FoG is a leading cause of disability in patients with Parkinson's disease,"" said Prof. Jeffrey Hausdorff of TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and the Center for Movement, Cognition, and Mobility at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC). Prof. Hausdorff is the lead investigator on the Israeli team. ""It often occurs during 'walking transitions' associated with turning, starting, stopping, and moving in open spaces. It can also occur when people approach narrow spaces, such as doors or elevators, and in crowded places. Recognizing such situations is a very powerful key for prevention   and this is one of the features of this program."" Prof. Hausdorff and his team at Tel Aviv Medical Center conducted a pilot study on 40 subjects: 20 patients with Parkinson's disease who used the CuPid app and 20 patients who carried out conventional exercises and did not use the app. The results are promising and the investigators are currently exploring the possibility of a larger follow-up study to further demonstrate the app's efficacy. Dr. Anat Mirelman, also of TAU and TASMC, co-directed the project. She explained that FoG episodes resemble a short circuit in the brain, rendering it unable to generate the appropriate stepping pattern, often leaving the patient in an untenable and frustrating situation. The app is designed to circumvent that difficulty. ""There are two modes to the app,"" said Dr. Mirelman. ""The first improves the overall gait pattern   'keep it up, you are walking well,' says a virtual physical therapist   and the positive feedback while walking actually helps the patient emotionally as well as functionally. If the gait pattern needs adjustments, the app will let the user know. The second mode helps patients avoid and free themselves of FoG if they are already stuck. We believe, and we have already seen in clinical trials here at the hospital, that this has the potential to improve the quality of life for these patients quite dramatically. ""FoG reduces patients' independence. Patients become afraid of walking by themselves and this leads to self-imposed restrictions in mobility,"" Dr. Mirelman continued. ""When their feet get stuck to the ground, their bodies lunge forward   it's very frightening. People often end up in wheelchairs, and this is a vicious cycle, as it places more reliance on the assisted-living infrastructure."" ""The program now integrates the expertise of a patient's physical therapist, who establishes what is considered a patient's 'normal' or 'strong' walking pattern,"" said Prof. Hausdorff.

The aggregates of misfolded proteins -- proteins that clump together in the ""wrong"" structure -- feature prominently in these fatal degenerative diseases. ""This is the big mystery we're trying to solve,"" says Woodside, a professor of physics. ""We want to understand the physics of the conversion from 'good' proteins to 'bad.'"" Understanding the conversion process should lead to finding new targets for drug development. Woodside's research group is one of the world leaders in the area of single-molecule studies of protein misfolding. A couple of years ago, the UAlberta researchers examined a single prion protein molecule to study how it behaves in isolation. However, it is in the interaction between molecules which is important in disease. To further the journey along the road to the eventual development of possible treatments, Woodside and his colleagues have now studied the interaction of two molecules. In contrast to single isolated molecules, in which incorrect structures did not last very long, two molecules interacting together could form an incorrect structure that was more stable than the correct one. The group used sensitive laser tweezers to manipulate the proteins and observe the microscopic motions of the molecules as they changed shape. Their most recent discovery opens a new window onto the microscopic mechanisms governing protein misfolding. Says Woodside, ""Our work is best viewed as just one step in solving a big mystery that still endures almost 20 years after the Nobel Prize was awarded for the prion hypothesis.""

Left untreated, the disease can cause a significant loss in quality of life, including unemployment and estrangement from loved ones. But many people with schizophrenia can control the disorder and live without symptoms for several years if they consistently take prescribed antipsychotic medication, typically a daily pill. The problem is that many people don't continue taking their medication once their symptoms improve. Now, a University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) study has found that people who took a long-acting injectable form of risperidone -- one given every two weeks -- had a substantially lower risk for the symptoms returning than people who took the daily medication as a pill. The study, published June 24 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, concluded that doctors should consider prescribing the long-lasting injectable medication much earlier in the course of treatment than they typically do today. ""We know that not taking antipsychotic medication is the single greatest modifiable risk factor for psychotic symptoms returning,"" said Kenneth Subotnik, an adjunct professor of psychiatry at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior and the study's first author, adding that patients who have only recently developed the disease are especially susceptible to not taking their medication daily. Although long-acting medications have been around since the 1970s, most previous studies have focused on patients who had experienced schizophrenia for many years. In those patients, the long-acting medications were not always a better alternative. The UCLA study focused specifically on patients who had recently developed the disorder. ""Individuals with a single episode of schizophrenia who have responded well to antipsychotic medication, even if they do understand they have a mental disorder, very often doubt whether medication continues to be necessary,"" said Keith Nuechterlein, a UCLA professor of psychiatry and senior author of the study. The researchers followed 83 people recently diagnosed with schizophrenia for a one-year period. Half were given the daily oral form of risperidone and the others were given the long-acting injectable form. All interventions were given as part of the UCLA Aftercare Research Program. The researchers found that patients taking the injectable medicine were much more likely to stick with their treatment than patients taking the oral form, and that the injectable did a better job of controlling psychotic symptoms. During the 12-month period, just 5 percent of those taking the injectable medication had their psychotic symptoms return, versus 33 percent of those taking the pill. In addition, Subotnik said, the benefits appear to be greater than when given after individuals have had the disorder for many years, which indicates that the long-acting injectable should be offered to patients earlier in the course of schizophrenia. Subotnik said another benefit of the injectable is that -- because it's administered at a doctor's office rather than taken at home -- doctors can more easily track whether patients are regularly taking the medication. ""Because of that, we had nearly perfect adherence to the long-acting form of risperidone,"" he said. Analyzing the same group of people, the researchers also found that consistent adherence to antipsychotic medication led to improvements in the patients' cognitive functioning, Nuechterlein said. (Those results have been presented at a conference but not yet published.) And in a 2012 study led by the late George Bartzokis, a UCLA professor of psychiatry, MRI scans of some of these participants found that the long-acting medication also increased the amount of brain myelin, the coating on nerve fibers which, like insulation around a wire, improves communication between nerve cells. Myelination often decreases in people with schizophrenia, which leads to impairments in brain function and cognition. Nuechterlein said the next stage of the research will be examining whether there are additional benefits of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication, and if it is just as effective if given only once a month instead of every two weeks.

Reported in PLOS ONE, these brain structures had gone unrecognized in studies published over the last 34 years. The results also may lend insight into the neural mechanisms of human speech. ""This finding opens up a huge avenue of research in parrots, in trying to understand how parrots are processing the information necessary to copy novel sounds and what are the mechanisms that underlie imitation of human speech sounds,"" said Mukta Chakraborty, a post-doctoral researcher in the lab of Erich Jarvis, an associate professor of neurobiology at Duke and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Parrots are one of the few animals considered 'vocal learners,' meaning they can imitate sounds. Researchers have been trying to figure out why some bird species are better imitators than others. Besides differences in the sizes of particular brain regions, however, no other potential explanations have surfaced. By examining gene expression patterns, the new study found that parrot brains are structured differently than the brains of songbirds and hummingbirds, which also exhibit vocal learning. In addition to having defined centers in the brain that control vocal learning called 'cores,' parrots have what the scientists call 'shells,' or outer rings, which are also involved in vocal learning. The shells are relatively bigger in species of parrots that are well known for their ability to imitate human speech, the group found. Until now, the budgerigar (common pet parakeet) was the only species of parrot whose brain had been probed for the mechanisms of vocal learning. This team included researchers from Denmark and the Netherlands who donated precious brain tissue for the study. They characterized the brains of eight parrot species besides the budgerigar, including conures, cockatiels, lovebirds, two species of Amazon parrots, a blue and gold macaw, a kea and an African Grey parrot. The researchers looked for specific gene markers that are known to have specialized activity in the brains of humans and song-learning birds. They compared the resulting gene expression patterns in all the parrot brains with neural tracing experiments in budgerigars. Even the most ancient of the parrot species they studied, the Kea of New Zealand, has a shell structure -- albeit rudimentary. This suggests that the populations of neurons in the shells probably arose at least 29 million years ago. Before now, some scientists had assumed that the regions surrounding the cores had nothing to do with vocal learning. In a 2000 study, Jarvis and Claudio Mello of Oregon Health & Science University concluded that the core and shell were actually one large structure. These differing views caused confusion about the sizes of the brain regions important for vocal learning. Jarvis teamed up with Steven Brauth from the University of Maryland and his former postdoctoral fellow Sarah Durand, to help reconcile this confusion. 'The first thing that surprised me when Mukta and I were looking at the new results is, 'Wow, how did I miss this all these years? How did everybody else miss this all these years?'' said Jarvis, who is also member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. 'The surprise to me was more about human psychology and what we look for and how biased we are in what we look for. Once you see it, it's obvious. I have these brain sections from 15 years ago, and now I can see it.' The new results support the group's hypothesis that in humans and other song-learning animals, the ability to imitate arose by brain pathway duplication. How such a copy-and-paste job could have happened is still unknown. ""How can you get a mirrored song system surrounding another one?"" Jarvis asks. ""Each (vocal learning center) has a core and a shell in the parrot, suggesting that the whole pathway has been duplicated."" Most of the bird's vocal learning brain regions are tucked into areas that also control movement. These areas in parrots also show some special patterns of gene expression, which the scientists speculate might explain why some parrots are also able to learn to dance to music. ""It takes significant brain power to process auditory information and produce the movements necessary for mimicking sounds of another species,"" Chakraborty said. ""The question is, how specialized are these parrot brains, and in what ways? Is it just a select group of specialized genes, or is it some specific projections that we haven't discovered yet?"" The scientists are especially curious about whether the shells give parrots a greater ability to imitate human speech. ""If that's true, then we've answered a big question in our field that people have been wanting to know for many years,"" Jarvis said. This finding is a part of a much larger international effort to sequence the complete genomes of all 10,000 species of birds in the next five years, called the Bird 10K Project.

The Edinburgh-based clinical informatics company will provide its data science expertise and AnalytiXagility platform to the study which will develop technology enabling the analysis of high frequency neurological data to better inform the diagnosis and treatment of patients with traumatic brain injuries.   Funding for the study has been awarded by Innovate UK and follows the success of an earlier pilot project which saw Aridhia and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde reduce the time taken to process sample data from patients with traumatic brain injuries from 16 hours to 48 minutes and demonstrated the clear advantages of using advanced analytics in a clinical setting. Building on the pilot, this expanded project will analyse live streams of vast amounts of physiological and clinical data collected in a real-time clinical setting, before translating it into clinically relevant information to allow rapid treatment decisions to be made at the bedside. By employing advanced data processing techniques, AnalytiXagility will enable previously unavailable models and algorithms to inform evidence-based decision making and in the future impact patient outcomes. The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020 traumatic brain injuries will be a major cause of death and disability. In Europe alone the cost of managing these injuries already exceeds  100 billion annually. As part of the project, Aridhia will create an app to enable clinical teams in the neurointensive care unit to select which algorithm to run on a particular patient s data, supporting a rapid and personalised approach to treatment. The app will then translate the results of the analysis back into the clinical setting to inform the best course of care for individual patients. The collaboration draws on the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians led by Dr Laura Moss, a Research and Development Healthcare Computer Scientist with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde s Department of Clinical Physics and Bioengineering. The University of Glasgow s Department of Anaesthesia, Pain & Critical Care will offer clinical input to the project, while Philips  bedside monitoring equipment will provide the patient data that will be analysed. Dr Moss said:  We expect this project to show that it is possible to analyse huge volumes of real-time neurological data and put the results back into clinical practice in such a way that will improve patient treatment. This could really revolutionise clinical decision-making around head injuries because, until now, this information has not been routinely available to clinicians.  Chris Roche, CEO at Aridhia stated:  Traumatic brain injuries are a growing public health issue and it is essential that we take an innovative approach to improving the diagnosis and treatment of these very serious injuries. This project demonstrates the importance of big data science in the clinical setting and the capability of Aridhia s AnalytiXagility platform in providing a high performance infrastructure to analyse vast amounts of data in a real-time environment.  The project will use anonymised data from patients in the neurointensive care unit at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Glasgow, part of the new South Glasgow University Hospital, one of the biggest and most technologically advanced campuses in Europe.","Published: June 25, 2015"

As a first step, Broad Institute s Genome Analysis Toolkit, or GATK, will be offered as a service on the Google Cloud Platform, as part of Google Genomics. The goal is to enable any genomic researcher to upload, store, and analyze data in a cloud-based environment that combines the Broad Institute s best-in-class genomic analysis tools with the scale and computing power of Google. GATK is a software package developed at the Broad Institute to analyze high-throughput genomic sequencing data. GATK offers a wide variety of analysis tools, with a primary focus on genetic variant discovery and genotyping as well as a strong emphasis on data quality assurance. Its robust architecture, powerful processing engine, and high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size. GATK is already available for download at no cost to academic and non-profit users. In addition, business users can license GATK from the Broad. To date, more than 20,000 users have processed genomic data using GATK. The Google Genomics service will provide researchers with a powerful, additional way to use GATK. Researchers will be able to upload genetic data and run GATK-powered analyses on Google Cloud Platform, and may use GATK to analyze genetic data already available for research via Google Genomics. GATK as a service will make best-practice genomic analysis readily available to researchers who don t have access to the dedicated compute infrastructure and engineering teams required for analyzing genomic data at scale. An initial alpha release of the GATK service will be made available to a limited set of users.  Large-scale genomic information is accelerating scientific progress in cancer, diabetes, psychiatric disorders, and many other diseases,  said Eric Lander, President and Director of Broad Institute.  Storing, analyzing, and managing these data is becoming a critical challenge for biomedical researchers. We are excited to work with Google s talented and experienced engineers to develop ways to empower researchers around the world by making it easier to access and use genomic information.   Broad and Google share a culture of collaboration and open access to data,  said David Glazer, Director of Google Genomics.  Google Genomics is helping scientists make genomic information more accessible and useful. By making Broad s GATK available through the Google Cloud Platform, we hope to accelerate great science.  Broad Institute plans to continue to support and upgrade GATK for all users, both on site and on the cloud, and will continue to offer the software directly. Academic and non-profit users will continue to have free access to GATK just as they do today through broadinstitute.org/gatk. Business users will continue to be able to license GATK through the Broad directly. By offering GATK on the Google Cloud Platform, users will have another option that could eliminate the need for labs to develop additional computing infrastructure on site. Broad Institute is a founding host institution of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), which was established in 2013 to build a shared framework to enable genomic and clinical data sharing while ensuring data privacy and security as genomic research continues to evolve. Google joined the Alliance in early 2014. Services available through the Broad and Google collaboration will be specifically designed to align with existing and emerging GA4GH standards. In keeping with the Broad s mission to foster openness and innovation, this collaboration will be non-exclusive. Broad and Google will each continue to engage with other community members on genomic projects to empower research worldwide.","Published: June 25, 2015"

Chan School of Public Health has identified a new potential anti-diabetes compound and a powerful way to quickly test whether other molecules can have a positive effect on a critical molecular pathway believed to be central to diseases ranging from diabetes to retinitis pigmentosa, cystic fibrosis, Huntington s disease, and Alzheimer s. The compound, which the authors have called azoramide, works by focusing on an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER is a tubular network within all cells where many key molecular building blocks of glucose metabolism, such as lipids and proteins, are synthesized. When someone is obese, the ER in metabolic tissues such as the liver, fat, and pancreas can no longer keep up with the demand for protein and lipid production. This results in ER stress which contributes to cellular dysfunction and the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in turn makes it difficult for the body to process glucose  high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes result, as well as a cascade of other cellular malfunctions that can lead to heart and blood vessel damage.  While we and others had previously discovered the central role that ER stress plays in diabetes and metabolic disease, efforts to translate that knowledge into clinically effective ways to improve ER function have had limited success so far,  says the study s senior author, G khan S. Hotamisligil, chair of the Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases and the Sabri  lker Center at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Lead authors were current and former Hotamisligil lab members Suneng Fu, Abdullah Yalcin, and Grace Yankun Lee. The study describes the development of two complementary assays that allow scientists to directly monitor ER function in live cellular systems in culture in the lab. This screening system enables measurement of the amount of chaperones, molecules that patrol and promote ER function, as well as the capacity of the ER to properly fold proteins into their three-dimensional shapes. Using this technique, they showed that azoramide uniquely improved both of these aspects of ER function. In further mechanistic work, they also demonstrated that azoramide could protect cells from death and dysfunction in multiple models of ER stress. The researchers next tested whether azoramide would be effective in mouse models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and determined that it greatly improved blood glucose levels by improving both the function of insulin-producing beta cells and increasing the ability of peripheral tissues to sense insulin. The next phase of this research would be to test this compound, or others that work in a similar manner, in human clinical trials. In another aspect of the paper s research the scientists determined that azoramide could potentially protect retinal cells from the genetic mutation that leads to ER stress and ultimately vision loss in one type of the disease retinitis pigmentosa.  These results show the broad potential for azoramide or drugs with similar functions targeted at the endoplasmic reticulum,  said Hotamisligil.  ER dysfunction is implicated in many other disease processes such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington s disease, and Alzheimer s which makes this novel screening strategy an exciting new tool that can be applied by multiple labs to discover new drug candidates for diseases that are linked to ER stress.

The new study has found that this rare  extra  base, known as 5-formylcytosine (5fC) is stable in living mouse tissues. While its exact function is yet to be determined, 5fC s physical position in the genome makes it likely that it plays a key role in gene activity.  This modification to DNA is found in very specific positions in the genome   the places which regulate genes,  said Dr Martin Bachman, who conducted the research while at Cambridge s Department of Chemistry.  In addition, it s been found in every tissue in the body   albeit in very low levels.   If 5fC is present in the DNA of all tissues, it is probably there for a reason,  said Professor Shankar Balasubramanian who led the research.  It had been thought this modification was solely a short-lived intermediate, but the fact that we ve demonstrated it can be stable in living tissue shows that it could regulate gene expression and potentially signal other events in cells.  Since the structure of DNA was discovered more than 60 years ago, it s been known that there are four DNA bases: G, C, A and T (Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine and Thymine). The way these bases are ordered determines the makeup of the genome. In addition to G, C, A and T, there are also small chemical modifications, or epigenetic marks, which affect how the DNA sequence is interpreted and control how certain genes are switched on or off. The study of these marks and how they affect gene activity is known as epigenetics. 5fC is one of these marks, and is formed when enzymes called TET enzymes add oxygen to methylated DNA   a DNA molecule with smaller molecules of methyl attached to the cytosine base. First discovered in 2011, it had been thought that 5fC was a  transitional  state of the cytosine base which was then being removed from DNA by dedicated repair enzymes. However, this new research has found that 5fC can actually be stable in living tissue, making it likely that it plays a key role in the genome. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, the researchers examined levels of 5fC in living adult and embryonic mouse tissues, as well as in mouse embryonic stem cells   the body s master cells which can become almost any cell type in the body. They found that 5fC is present in all tissues, but is very rare, making it difficult to detect. Even in the brain, where it is most common, 5fC is only present at around 10 parts per million or less. In other tissues throughout the body, it is present at between one and five parts per million. The researchers applied a method consisting of feeding cells and living mice with an amino acid called L-methionine, enriched for naturally occurring stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen, and measuring the uptake of these isotopes to 5fC in DNA. The lack of uptake in the non-dividing adult brain tissue pointed to the fact that 5fC can be a stable modification: if it was a transient molecule, this uptake of isotopes would be high. The researchers believe that 5fC might alter the way DNA is recognised by proteins.  Unmodified DNA interacts with a specific set of proteins, and the presence of 5fC could change these interactions either directly or indirectly by changing the shape of the DNA duplex,  said Bachman.  A different shape means that a DNA molecule could then attract different proteins and transcription factors, which could in turn change the way that genes are expressed.   This will alter the thinking of people in the study of development and the role that these modifications may play in the development of certain diseases,  said Balasubramanian.  While work is continuing in determining the exact function of this  extra  base, its position in the genome suggests that it has a key role in the regulation of gene expression.

The system eliminates tubes and wires required by other implantable devices that can lead to infection and other complications, said team leader Richard Borgens, Purdue University's Mari Hulman George Professor of Applied Neuroscience and director of Purdue's Center for Paralysis Research. ""This tool allows us to apply drugs as needed directly to the site of injury, which could have broad medical applications,"" Borgens said. ""The technology is in the early stages of testing, but it is our hope that this could one day be used to deliver drugs directly to spinal cord injuries, ulcerations, deep bone injuries or tumors, and avoid the terrible side effects of systemic treatment with steroids or chemotherapy."" The team tested the drug-delivery system in mice with compression injuries to their spinal cords and administered the corticosteroid dexamethasone. The study measured a molecular marker of inflammation and scar formation in the central nervous system and found that it was reduced after one week of treatment.  The nanowires are made of polypyrrole, a conductive polymer material that responds to electromagnetic fields. Wen Gao, a postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Paralysis Research who worked on the project with Borgens, grew the nanowires vertically over a thin gold base, like tiny fibers making up a piece of shag carpet hundreds of times smaller than a human cell. The nanowires can be loaded with a drug and, when the correct electromagnetic field is applied, the nanowires release small amounts of the payload. This process can be started and stopped at will, like flipping a switch, by using the corresponding electromagnetic field stimulating device, Borgens said. The researchers captured and transported a patch of the nanowire carpet on water droplets that were used used to deliver it to the site of injury. The nanowire patches adhere to the site of injury through surface tension, Gao said. The magnitude and wave form of the electromagnetic field must be tuned to obtain the optimum release of the drug, and the precise mechanisms that release the drug are not yet well understood, she said. The team is investigating the release process. The electromagnetic field is likely affecting the interaction between the nanomaterial and the drug molecules, Borgens said. ""We think it is a combination of charge effects and the shape change of the polymer that allows it to store and release drugs,"" he said. ""It is a reversible process. Once the electromagnetic field is removed, the polymer snaps back to the initial architecture and retains the remaining drug molecules."" For each different drug the team would need to find the corresponding optimal electromagnetic field for its release, Gao said. This study builds on previous work by Borgens and Gao. Gao first had to figure out how to grow polypyrrole in a long vertical architecture, which allows it to hold larger amounts of a drug and extends the potential treatment period. The team then demonstrated it could be manipulated to release dexamethasone on demand Other team members involved in the research include John Cirillo, who designed and constructed the electromagnetic field stimulating system; Youngnam Cho, a former faculty member at Purdue s Center for Paralysis Research; and Jianming Li, a research assistant professor at the center. For the most recent study the team used mice that had been genetically modified such that the protein Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, or GFAP, is luminescent. GFAP is expressed in cells called astrocytes that gather in high numbers at central nervous system injuries. Astrocytes are a part of the inflammatory process and form a scar tissue, Borgens said. A 1-2 millimeter patch of the nanowires doped with dexamethasone was placed onto spinal cord lesions that had been surgically exposed, Borgens said. The lesions were then closed and an electromagnetic field was applied for two hours a day for one week. By the end of the week the treated mice had a weaker GFAP signal than the control groups, which included mice that were not treated and those that received a nanowire patch but were not exposed to the electromagnetic field. In some cases, treated mice had no detectable GFAP signal. Whether the reduction in astrocytes had any significant impact on spinal cord healing or functional outcomes was not studied. In addition, the concentration of drug maintained during treatment is not known because it is below the limits of systemic detection, Borgens said.  ""This method allows a very, very small dose of a drug to effectively serve as a big dose right where you need it,"" Borgens said. ""By the time the drug diffuses from the site out into the rest of the body it is in amounts that are undetectable in the usual tests to monitor the concentration of drugs in the bloodstream."" Polypyrrole is an inert and biocompatable material, but the team is working to create a biodegradeable form that would dissolve after the treatment period ended, he said. The team also is trying to increase the depth at which the drug delivery device will work. The current system appears to be limited to a depth in tissue of less than 3 centimeters, Gao said.","Published: June 25, 2015"

The findings could provide key information for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine. The research represents a leap forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against HIV, which has so far struggled to elicit antibodies (immune system molecules) that can effectively fight off different strains of the virus.  The results are pretty spectacular,  said Dennis Burton, chair of the TSRI Department of Immunology and Microbial Science and scientific director of two centers at TSRI, the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Consortium (NAC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID). The Science study was co-led by Burton, TSRI Professor and IAVI NAC Director of Vaccine Design William Schief, and TSRI Professor David Nemazee. The Cell study was co-led by Schief and Michel Nussenzweig, who is Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor at The Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. A Huge Challenge The researchers  long-term goal is to design a vaccine that prompts the body to produce antibodies that bind to HIV and prevent infection. While many vaccines for other diseases use a dead or inactive version of the disease-causing microbe itself to trigger antibody production, immunizations with  native  HIV proteins are ineffective in triggering an effective immune response, due to HIV s ability to evade detection from the immune system and mutate rapidly into new strains. This challenge has led many researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need to consist of a series of related, but slightly different proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV a twist on the traditional  booster  shot, where a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times. In the new studies, the scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer, a protein nanoparticle designed to bind and activate B cells needed to fight HIV. The eOD-GT8 60mer was developed in the Schief lab and tested in mouse models engineered by the Nemazee lab to produce antibodies that resemble human antibodies.Protein nanoparticle eOD-GT8 60mer Using a technique called B cell sorting, the researchers showed that immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody  precursors with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunizations against HIV.  The vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to  prime  the antibody response,  added Nemazee. In the paper, researchers used the same eOD-GT8 60mer immunogen but used a slightly different mouse model.  The immunogen again launched the immune system in the right direction,  said Schief. A concurrent study also in Science (led by Professor John Moore of Weill Cornell Medical College and including contributions from Schief, Burton, TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward, Ian Wilson, who is Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and chair of the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at TSRI, and other researchers) showed engineered immunogens also triggered immune responses in rabbit models and non-human primate models. Next Steps With eOD-GT8 60mer in the running as a potential contributor to an HIV vaccine, the researchers are now investigating other immunogens that could work in conjunction with it. Schief said the Nemazee lab s mouse models will be crucial resources for testing other engineered immunogens. He emphasized the importance of bringing different disciplines together to engineer mouse models, design antibodies and analyze results.  This was a beautiful collaboration of three labs at TSRI,  said Schief.","Published: June 25, 2015"

Cholinergic interneurons are rare -- they make up just one to two percent of the neurons in the striatum, a key part of the brain involved with higher-level decision-making. Scientists have suspected they play a role in changing strategies, and researchers at OIST recently confirmed this with experiments. Their findings were published in The Journal of Neuroscience. ""Not much is known about these neurons,"" said Sho Aoki, a post-doctoral researcher at OIST and lead author of the paper. ""But we now have clear evidence that they play a key role in remaining flexible in this ever-changing world."" Previous studies tried to identify the role of cholinergic interneurons by recording brain wave activity during behavioral tasks. While that can strongly indicate specific neurons are correlated with a particular behavior, it is not definitive. In this study, Aoki killed cholinergic interneurons with a toxin that directly targets them, and then observed how rats reacted to rule changes compared with normal rats with intact neurons. ""Our experiments show direct causation, not correlation,"" Aoki said. Rats with and without damaged neurons were given tasks for several weeks -- they had to press either lever A or B to get a sugar pellet reward. During the first few days, Lever A always resulted in a reward. Both groups of rats had no problem learning the initial strategy to get the sugar pellet -- press Lever A. But then, the rules of the game changed. A novel stimulus was introduced -- a light flashed above the correct lever, which oscillated between Lever A and B. To get their sugar fix, the rats had to shift strategy and pay attention to this new information. While normal rats quickly responded to the light, rats with damaged neurons could not. The latter group continued to repeat the strategy they had already learned, and were disinclined to explore what the light meant. In another test, a light cue that had been flashing in a meaningless pattern during the initial learning phase switched to signaling the correct lever to push for reward. This meant to maximize rewards, and the animals should now pay attention to a stimulus they previously ignored. Again, the control rats had no problem adapting to this rule change, but the damaged rats stuck to their original strategy, even though it meant fewer rewards. They also decreased exploring what might increase their chance of success. Interestingly, rats with neurons damaged in the dorsomedial part of the striatum had greater difficulty paying attention to previously irrelevant light cues. Rats with neurons damaged in the ventral part of the striatum had a harder time reacting to novel stimulants. ""This indicates that cholinergic interneurons throughout the striatum play a common role, namely inhibiting old rules and encouraging exploration, but different regions of the striatum are activated depending on the situation and type of stimulus,"" Aoki said. The research findings might help researchers and medical professionals who investigate aging. ""Since cholinergic interneurons degenerate with age, this work may provide a clue for understanding the decline in mental flexibility that occurs with advancing age,"" said professor Jeff Wickens, head of OIST's Neurobiology Research Unit and senior paper author.

Left untreated, OCD can be profoundly distressing to the patient and can adversely affect their ability to succeed in school, hold a job or function in society. One of the most common and effective treatments is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which aims to help patients understand the thoughts and feelings that influence their behaviors and then work toward eliminating them. But not all OCD sufferers benefit over the long term: In an estimated 20 percent of patients, symptoms eventually return after the therapy is complete. A new study by researchers at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) suggests that a certain detail from patients  brain scans could help clinicians identify which people are more likely to relapse after cognitive-behavioral therapy   and why.  The efficiency of brain network connectivity before treatment predicts the worsening of symptoms after treatment,  said Jamie Feusner, a UCLA associate professor of psychiatry and director of the Semel Institute s Adult OCD Program. Feusner and Joseph O Neill, a UCLA associate professor of child psychiatry and a research scientist at the Semel Institute, were the study s co-principal investigators. The research was published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Psychiatry.  The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to study the brains of 17 people, aged 21 to 50 years old, with OCD. Scans were taken both before and immediately after the patients completed an intensive four-week course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the doctors monitored the patients  clinical symptoms over the next 12 months.  We found that cognitive-behavioral therapy itself results in more densely connected local brain networks, which likely reflects more efficient brain activity,  Feusner said. However, the researchers also found that people who had more efficient brain connectivity before they began treatment actually did worse in the follow-up period. Surprisingly, neither the severity of symptoms before treatment nor the amount that symptoms improvement during treatment were accurate predictors of the patients  post-treatment success. The researchers say that knowing more about which patients might not fare well long-term could potentially help doctors and patients choose the best course of treatment.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy is in many cases very effective, at least in the short term. But it is costly, time-consuming, difficult for patients and, in many areas, not available,  Feusner said.  Thus, if someone will end up having their symptoms return, it would be useful to know before they get treatment.  He added that the findings don t mean that some people with OCD cannot be helped   just that four weeks of intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy might not be the most effective long-term approach. OCD can also be treated with medication or through cognitive-behavioral therapy that lasts longer than the four-week period evaluated in the study. The UCLA study was the first to use brain connectivity to help predict a post-treatment clinical course, and the first to test the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on brain network connectivity. Feusner and his colleagues are conducting several other studies to understand the effects of the treatment on the brain in people with OCD and with other OCD-related disorders, including body dysmorphic disorder and anorexia nervosa.  We are now starting to translate knowledge of the brain into useful information that in the future could be used by doctors and patients to make clinical decisions,  Feusner said.  Although a brain scan may seem expensive, these scans only took about 15 minutes and thus the cost is not exceptionally high, particularly in comparison to medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy treatments, which over time can cost many thousands of dollars.  Feusner, O Neill and their colleagues plan to conduct another study in a larger number of patients in an attempt to validate the findings; they also will assess additional measures of brain function and structure that they hope will offer more clues to determining the long-term course of symptoms in people being treated for OCD.

The neuroimaging study   believed to be an unprecedented examination of a group of people who all experienced the same single blow trauma   is published this month online in the journal Clinical Psychological Science (CPS). Led by Baycrest Health Sciences' Rotman Research Institute, it is the second major paper to come out in less than a year on passengers who were aboard Air Transat Flight 236 when the crippled plane made a harrowing landing on a small island military base in the Azores to avoid ditching in the ocean. In the first phase of the study, published in 2014 in CPS, the researchers asked the passengers to complete a memory test (without brain scanning) to probe the quality of passengers' memories of the flight experience three years after the traumatic incident, along with memories of 9/11 and a neutral event. The researchers showed that all the passengers remembered a remarkable amount of detail for the Air Transat (AT) incident, regardless of whether or not they had post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although individuals with PTSD tended to veer off topic and recall additional information that was not central to the events assessed. Almost a decade later, eight passengers agreed to the second phase of the study, which involved brain scanning during presentation of video recreation of the AT incident (obtained from broadcasters such as NBC), footage of the 9/11 attacks, and a neutral event. Of the eight passengers tested, some had a diagnosis of PTSD, but most did not. The group of eight ranged in age from 30s to 60s, including one married couple. 'This traumatic incident still haunts passengers regardless of whether they have PTSD or not. They remember the event as though it happened yesterday, when in fact it happened almost a decade ago (at the time of the brain scanning). Other more mundane experiences tend to fade with the passage of time, but trauma leaves a lasting memory trace,' said Dr. Daniela Palombo, the study's lead author and currently a post-doctoral researcher at VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University School of Medicine. 'We've uncovered some hints into the brain mechanisms through which this may occur.' Placed inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, each of the eight passengers recalled details of their experience on AT Flight 236 while presented with the video clips. Their recollection was associated with heightened responses in a network of brain regions known to be involved in emotional memory -- including the amygdala, hippocampus, and midline frontal and posterior regions, when compared to remembering a neutral autobiographical memory. 'Research on highly traumatic memory relies on animal studies, where brain responses to fear can be experimentally manipulated and observed,' said Dr. Brian Levine, senior scientist at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, and senior author on the paper. 'Thanks to the passengers who volunteered, we were able to examine the human brain's response to traumatic memory at a degree of vividness that is generally impossible to attain.' Researchers were surprised to find that the passengers showed a remarkably similar pattern of heightened brain activity in relation to another significant but less personal trauma -- the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which occurred just three weeks after the Air Transat incident. This enhancement effect was not evident in the brains of a comparison group of individuals when they recalled 9/11 during their fMRI scan. Palombo said the 'carryover effect' in the AT passengers was intriguing and may indicate that the flight scare changed the way the passengers process new information, possibly making them more sensitive to other negative life experiences. In other words, after you experience a trauma, you may see the world with a new lens. Summarizing the importance of the two-phase study, Palombo remarked: 'Here we have a group of people who all experienced the same extremely intense trauma. Some were more affected and went on to develop PTSD; some did not. How each of them responded to this terrifying event has been informative for helping us move a step closer toward understanding the brain processes involved in traumatic memory.' The behavioural and neural mechanisms of traumatic memory remain controversial in the scientific community. The Rotman study with Air Transat passengers shows how memory for a single life-threatening event is processed in the brain, even after 10 years have passed. Palombo and Levine, along with their team, hope the research will inspire further studies in this area and lead to improved understanding and treatment of PTSD.

Fish with larger brains and higher intelligence had higher expression of Ang-1, and when expression levels of Ang-1 were experimentally reduced, brains shrunk. These trends were seen in two unrelated species of fish   guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)   indicating expression of Ang-1 is important for brain growth and development in fish generally. The study, published June 24 in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, identified the underlying genetics of natural variation in brain size and cognitive abilities in fish. Ang-1 could play an important role in the brain development of other vertebrates, including humans, but future research is required to establish this say the scientists involved. Populations of guppies selected for either large or small brains, with associated differences in intelligence, were used for the first step in the study which was a complete genome analysis of differently expressed genes. There was a 10% difference in brain size between the large and small-brain guppies and from the genetic analysis, Ang-1 was identified as the only gene expressed at different levels in each replicate population. Further experiments in zebrafish by collaborator Professor Pertti Panula at Helsinki University confirmed that Ang-1 is a driver for brain size. Professor Judith Mank, UCL Biosciences, said:  We were surprised to see that only a single gene was up-regulated in the large-brained guppies. Given the complexity of the brain, we expected that the genetics would be very intricate, but this suggests that changes in brain size are underpinned by relatively simple genetic mechanisms.  The protein encoded by Ang-1 is known to play an important role in growing new blood vessels and forming new brain cells in mice, which may indicate an important role of Ang-1 in brain growth of other animals, even in humans, say the scientists behind the study. Dr Niclas Kolm, Stockholm University, said:  Other genes may be involved in brain growth in young, developing fish but no other genes were found to vary in their expression in adult fish other than Ang-1. Future studies will aim to investigate the role of Ang-1 and possibly other genes in the formation of differently sized brains in developing embryos . Professor Mank added:  We don t yet know if Ang-1 is important in human brain development   it isn t on the list of genes typically studied in relation to human brain size   but as it plays a role in forming new blood vessels in humans, there may be a connection as large brains need a bigger blood supply, particularly during growth and for many brain functions. This presents us with an exciting opportunity to investigate the role of Ang-1 across different vertebrates.  The team now plans to study the age-specific genetic architecture of both brain structure and function based on new artificial selection experiments in the guppy.

The findings show that the Argus II significantly improves visual function and quality of life for people blinded by retinitis pigmentosa. They were published online June 23 in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable disease that affects about 1 in 4,000 Americans and causes slow vision loss that eventually leads to blindness. The Argus II system was designed to help provide patients who have lost their sight due to the disease with some useful vision. Through the device, patients with retinitis pigmentosa are able to see patterns of light that the brain learns to interpret as an image. The system uses a miniature video camera stored in the patient s glasses to send visual information to a small computerized video processing unit which can be stored in a pocket. This computer turns the image to electronic signals that are sent wirelessly to an electronic device implanted on the retina, the layer of light-sensing cells lining the back of the eye. The Argus II received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) in 2013, which is an approval specifically for devices intended to benefit small populations and/or rare conditions. To further evaluate the safety, reliability and benefit of the device, a clinical trial of 30 people, aged 28 to 77, was conducted in the United States and Europe. All of the study participants had little or no light perception in both eyes. The researchers conducted visual function tests using both a computer screen and real-world conditions, including finding and touching a door and identifying and following a line on the ground. A Functional Low-vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA) was also performed by independent visual rehabilitation experts at the request of the FDA to assess the impact of the Argus II system on the subjects  everyday lives, including extensive interviews and tasks performed around the home. The visual function results indicated that up to 89 percent of the subjects performed significantly better with the device. The FLORA found that among the subjects, 80 percent received benefit from the system when considering both functional vision and patient-reported quality of life, and no subjects were affected negatively. After one year, two-thirds of the subjects had not experienced device- or surgery-related serious adverse events. After three years, there were no device failures. Throughout the three years, 11 subjects experienced serious adverse events, most of which occurred soon after implantation and were successfully treated. One of these treatments, however, was to remove the device due to recurring erosion after the suture tab on the device became damaged.  This study shows that the Argus II system is a viable treatment option for people profoundly blind due to retinitis pigmentosa - one that can make a meaningful difference in their lives and provides a benefit that can last over time,  said Allen C. Ho, M.D., lead author of the study and director of the clinical retina research unit at Wills Eye Hospital.

The patch   a thin square no bigger than a penny   is covered with more than one hundred tiny needles, each about the size of an eyelash. These  microneedles  are packed with microscopic storage units for insulin and glucose-sensing enzymes that rapidly release their cargo when blood sugar levels get too high. The study, found that the new, painless patch could lower blood glucose in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes for up to nine hours. More pre-clinical tests and subsequent clinical trials in humans will be required before the patch can be administered to patients, but the approach shows great promise.  We have designed a patch for diabetes that works fast, is easy to use, and is made from nontoxic, biocompatible materials,  said co-senior author Zhen Gu, Ph.D., a professor in the Joint UNC/NC State Department of Biomedical Engineering. Gu also holds appointments in the UNC School of Medicine, the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and the UNC Diabetes Care Center.  The whole system can be personalized to account for a diabetic s weight and sensitivity to insulin,  he added,  so we could make the smart patch even smarter.  Diabetes affects more than 387 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to grow to 592 million by the year 2035. Patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes try to keep their blood sugar levels under control with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots, a process that is painful and imprecise. John Buse, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the PNAS paper and the director of the UNC Diabetes Care Center, said,  Injecting the wrong amount of medication can lead to significant complications like blindness and limb amputations, or even more disastrous consequences such as diabetic comas and death.  Researchers have tried to remove the potential for human error by creating  closed-loop systems  that directly connect the devices that track blood sugar and administer insulin. However, these approaches involve mechanical sensors and pumps, with needle-tipped catheters that have to be stuck under the skin and replaced every few days. Instead of inventing another completely manmade system, Gu and his colleagues chose to emulate the body s natural insulin generators known as beta cells. These versatile cells act both as factories and warehouses, making and storing insulin in tiny sacs called vesicles. They also behave like alarm call centers, sensing increases in blood sugar levels and signaling the release of insulin into the bloodstream.  We constructed artificial vesicles to perform these same functions by using two materials that could easily be found in nature,  said PNAS first author Jiching Yu, a Ph.D. student in Gu s lab. The first material was hyaluronic acid or HA, a natural substance that is an ingredient of many cosmetics. The second was 2-nitroimidazole or NI, an organic compound commonly used in diagnostics. The researchers connected the two to create a new molecule, with one end that was water-loving or hydrophilic and one that was water-fearing or hydrophobic. A mixture of these molecules self-assembled into a vesicle, much like the coalescing of oil droplets in water, with the hydrophobic ends pointing inward and the hydrophilic ends pointing outward. The result was millions of bubble-like structures, each 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Into each of these vesicles, the researchers inserted a core of solid insulin and enzymes specially designed to sense glucose. In lab experiments, when blood sugar levels increased, the excess glucose crowded into the artificial vesicles. The enzymes then converted the glucose into gluconic acid, consuming oxygen all the while. The resulting lack of oxygen or  hypoxia  made the hydrophobic NI molecules turn hydrophilic, causing the vesicles to rapidly fall apart and send insulin into the bloodstream. Once the researchers designed these  intelligent insulin nanoparticles,  they had to figure out a way to administer them to patients with diabetes. Rather than rely on the large needles or catheters that had beleaguered previous approaches, they decided to incorporate these balls of sugar-sensing, insulin-releasing material into an array of tiny needles. Gu created these  microneedles  using the same hyaluronic acid that was a chief ingredient of the nanoparticles, only in a more rigid form so the tiny needles were stiff enough to pierce the skin. They arranged more than one hundred of these microneedles on a thin silicon strip to create what looks like a tiny, painless version of a bed of nails. When this patch was placed onto the skin, the microneedles penetrated the surface, tapping into the blood flowing through the capillaries just below. The researchers tested the ability of this approach to control blood sugar levels in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. They gave one set of mice a standard injection of insulin and measured the blood glucose levels, which dropped down to normal but then they quickly climbed back into the hyperglycemic range. In contrast, when the researchers treated another set of mice with the microneedle patch, they saw that blood glucose levels were brought under control within thirty minutes and stayed that way for several hours. In addition, the researchers found that they could tune the patch to alter blood glucose levels only within a certain range by varying the dose of enzyme contained within each of the microneedles. They also found that the patch did not pose the hazards that insulin injections do. Injections can send blood sugar plummeting to dangerously low levels when administered too frequently.  The hard part of diabetes care is not the insulin shots, or the blood sugar checks, or the diet but the fact that you have to do them all several times a day every day for the rest of your life, said Buse, the director of the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (NC TraCS) Institute and past president of the American Diabetes Association.  If we can get these patches to work in people, it will be a game changer.  Because mice are less sensitive to insulin than humans, the researchers think that the blood sugar-stabilizing effects of the patch could last even longer when given to actual patients. Their eventual goal, Gu said, is to develop a smart insulin patch that patients would only have to change every few days.","Published: June 24, 2015"

The decision was made in agreement with the French regulator, Agence Nationale de S curit  du M dicament, (ANSM). The decision was made so that TxCell could take action to ensure future compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for the Besan on facility. The manufacturing site in Besan on obtained manufacturing authorization on September 23, 2013 (amended on June 5, 2014) as well as GMP certification on June 10, 2014. This pilot manufacturing unit in Besan on is temporary as TxCell intends to move all production to a new commercial GMP manufacturing facility by 2018. Specifically, the actions taken by TxCell aim at eliminating the risk of microbial contamination of released drug products. At the current time, no contamination has been found in any product manufactured and released from the TxCell Besan on site. Manufacturing of new products by TxCell at Besan on will pause until compliance is ensured. TxCell expects to complete this by the end of the summer. TxCell will then demonstrate GMP compliance. This is expected before the end of the year. Treatment of patients in the CATS29 study (an ongoing phase 2b clinical trial with Ovasave to treat refractory Crohn patients) for whom at least one injection had been given, will continue. This is subject to the implementation of a risk analysis pre-approved by ANSM.  Since the decision was already made to engage a supplier (Contract Manufacturing Organization, or  CMO ) to enable an acceleration of recruitment in clinical trials from 2016 to 2018, this partial hold should have only potential limited impact on clinical timelines communicated in May 2015 and will not change TxCell s development plan in the long run,  said St phane Boissel, CEO, TxCell.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/evoengineered-crisprcas9s-hit-more-geneediting-targets-193864,Evo Engineered CRISPR Cas s Hit More Gene Editing Targets Scientists have engineered a more effective CRISPR  Cas  system paving the way for more advanced applications  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. One particular Cas9 nuclease, the one derived from the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, has excited the gene-editing world, but it has its limitations. While it is true that this Cas9, in a CRISPR-Cas9 system, can be teamed with different guide RNAs to seek different DNA sequences, it cannot always insert double-strand breaks near these DNA sequences. This Cas9, which is called SpCas9, must also recognize a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which may or may not sit beside the target DNA. Because DNA target sequences and PAM sequences are not always conveniently arrayed, SpCas9 sometimes fails to snip DNA with sufficient precision. To get around this limitation, a team of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) scientists subjected S. pyogenes and other bacterial species to directed evolution, a positive-selection engineering system in which survival was enabled by Cas9-mediated cleavage of a selection plasmid encoding an inducible toxic gene. This engineering system allowed the scientists to rapidly evolve the ability of SpCas9 to recognize different PAM sequences. From a collection of randomly mutated SpCas9 variants, the scientists identified combinations of mutations that enabled SpCas9 to recognize new PAM sequences. These evolved variants, the scientists estimated, essentially double the range of sites that can now be targeted for gene editing using SpCas9. Fortuitously, they also identified an SpCas9 variant that was less likely to induce the off-target gene mutations sometimes produced by CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases. They also showed that the Cas9 nucleases that are derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophiles bacteria, not just S. pyogenes bacteria, can also function in the MGH team s bacterial evolution system, suggesting that Cas9 nucleases from these additional bacterial can be functionally modified as well.  We show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design,  wrote the authors.  These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis.   In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells,  the authors continued.  We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells.  And so the MGH team, led by J. Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D., assert that they can overcome the gene-editing limitations imposed by SpCas9 s preference for a certain PAM sequences those in which a nucleotide is followed by two guanine DNA bases. ""[The additional evolved SpCas9 variant] with increased specificity should be immediately useful to all researchers who currently use wild-type SpCas9 and should reduce the frequencies of unwanted off-target mutations,"" Dr. Joung noted.

It affects white blood cells, which are an essential component of our immune system that fights infection. T-ALL onset is linked to microRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules that silence RNA and regulate gene expression. Most MicroRNAs are generated with the help of the enzyme Dicer1, which has been the focus of research for treating T-ALL. EPFL scientists now show that Dicer1 is crucial for the development of T-ALL, and inhibiting it can actually prevent the disease altogether.  MicroRNAs begin life as hairpin-like structures in the cell s nucleus. An enzyme called Dicer1 then cuts the hairpins into two strands of microRNA. One strand is discarded, while the other will form a complex with a group of proteins, which will then bind to and block the RNA carrying the genetic information of interest. The cell s machinery can no longer read the information, and the gene stops producing its protein. The lab of Freddy Radtke at EPFL has now shown that Dicer1 is a central factor in T-ALL, and that blocking it can prevent the disease altogether. The scientists tracked the development of T-ALL in genetically engineered mice where Dicer1 could be abrogated in a mouse model where a mutated cancer gene induces T-ALL. This type of leukemia evolves from a relatively benign stage to an aggressive form that eventually kills the patient. In this study, Fabian Junker, a recent PhD graduate from Radtke s team,  switched off  Dicer1 in the mice at different stages of T-ALL. The aim was to see what role the enzyme plays in the evolution of this cancer. Switching Dicer1 off at an early stage of T-ALL completely prevented the development of the disease despite the mutated gene. But even more fascinating was the fact that, in mice where Dicer1 was completely abrogated, T-ALL cells were entirely eliminated, allowing all the mice to survive. This survival effect was further confirmed by monitoring the few residual  leukemic  cells taken from these animals.  You can actually see the cancer cells dying off after Dicer1 has been abrogated,  said Freddy Radtke. The key to this cell death is the production of microRNAs by Dicer1. The researchers observed that a previously unrecognized microRNA molecule (miR-21) was deregulated in both mouse and human T-ALL. The team also discovered why: when a person suffers from T-ALL, this particular microRNA blocks a gene that normally suppresses the blood tumor cells. But without Dicer1, there is no miR-21 to do this, thereby allowing the tumor-suppressing gene to fight back the disease. The study is the first to conclusively demonstrate that Dicer1 plays a role in T-ALL, and paves the way for a new set of treatment for in this, and possibly other types of cancer. However, when dealing with molecules that are so fundamental to the cell s life, the challenge is to specifically target the cells of interest.  We can t just go shutting down Dicer1 across the board,  explains Freddy Radtke.  Otherwise we ll end up killing healthy cells as well.  His lab is now focused, among other projects, to tackling this obstacle.","Published: June 24, 2015"

""This loss of genes very likely corresponds to the loss of an entire respiratory complex,"" said Jeff Palmer, IU Distinguished Professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Biology, who led the study. ""This is something that hasn't been reported before for any multicellular organism."" The genes that have been lost from V. scurruloideum typically reside in the mitochondrial genomes of plants and animals. Mitochondria play an important role in the overall metabolism of cellular organisms, serving as generators that produce energy to power other functions of the cell through respiration. Contained within all eukaryotic cells, mitochondria possess their own DNA because of their evolutionary history as an ""enslaved"" bacterium swallowed up billions of years ago by a primitive eukaryotic organism. Biologists regard the mitochondrial genomes, or mitogenomes, of flowering plants as ""extreme and often perplexing"" in their wide range of sizes, structures and mutation rates, Palmer said. But this genetic diversity has never before been shown to include the loss of genes involved in the mitochondria's primary genetic function of respiration. In addition to the loss of these genes, the V. scurruloideum mitogenome shows other signs of degenerative evolution, such as miniaturization and an accelerated mutation rate. This strange ""de-evolution"" may be related to the mistletoe's status as an obligate parasite, meaning it requires a host plant to complete its life cycle. ""This plant has taken a unique overall tack in evolution, presumably related to its parasitic lifestyle,"" said Elizabeth Skippington, a postdoctoral fellow at IU who is first author on the study. ""Whether cause or cure, parasitism is most likely at the root of its extremely small mitochondrial genome, which shows clear signs of both rapid and degenerative evolution."" Specifically, Skippington said the V. scurruloideum mitogenome had lost all nine mitochondrial genes encoding respiratory Complex I, a principal component of the main energy-producing pathway in aerobic organisms. Yet the loss of this complex has not dramatically affected the capacity of the plant to produce energy. ""The loss of these genes is highly unexpected,"" Skippington said. ""Over 300 other flowering plants have previously been examined, and Complex I is present in every single species. Presumably, V. scurruloideum's parasitic lifestyle has allowed it to survive and thrive regardless of the absence of these genes."" Although in rare cases mitochondrial genes may be transferred to the nucleus of a cell, she said the IU team found no evidence to suggest this is the case in V. scurruloideum, and that further investigation will be required to reveal the exact mechanism through which the species compensates for its missing genes. The IU scientists discovered the unprecedented lack of Complex I in a multicellular organism during a larger project to expand the number of parasitic plants that have undergone mitochondrial genome sequencing. Previous analyses of the mitochondrial genomes of parasitic plants were limited to Rafflesiaceae, a small family of parasites famous for possessing the largest flowers in the world. To expand knowledge about parasitic plants, the IU team chose to sequence the mitochondrial genomes of Santalales, more commonly referred to as mistletoes, which are the largest order of parasitic plants in the world with over 2,000 species. Some parasitic members of Santalales attach to the roots of other plants to feed; others attach to stems. An aerial parasite, V. scurruloideum attaches to the stem of its host plant to derive nutrients for survival, and its general appearance is familiar to anyone who has ever stood under mistletoe during the holiday season. Despite their familiar role in Christmas traditions, however, Palmer said the broader ecological importance and prevalence of mistletoes across the world is commonly unrecognized. ""The mitogenome of V. scurruloideum has proven an unexpected goldmine of surprises, setting new benchmarks for the extremes of genome size, gene content, protein divergence and other biological mechanisms,"" he said. ""We expect further investigation into this family of plants, as well as other parasitic flowering plants, will provide even more significant insights into the evolution and function of parasitism in plants.""","Published: June 24, 2015"

The study will help provide credible data for human health related to anthrax exposure and help officials better understand risks related to a potential anthrax attack. The study also defined for the first time where the spores germinate and shows that the type of cell lines and methods of culturing affect the growth rates. ""What we're learning will help inform the National Biological Threat Risk Assessment   a computer tool being developed by the Department of Homeland Security,"" said Tim Straub, a chemical and biological scientist at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. ""There is little data to estimate or predict the average number of spores needed to infect someone. By better understanding exposure thresholds, the ultimate goal is to be able to predict outcomes from terrorist incidents involving Bacillus anthracis."" There are decades of data characterizing anthrax exposure in rabbits, but there is limited understanding of how this data extrapolates to humans. When researchers delved into this, working from cultured normal lung cells from each species, they found that, at low doses, the proliferation of anthrax spores is lower in human lung cells. It's too early to say what that means for human health, but the study's methods and results may resolve a long-standing debate on the pathogen's propagation. Researchers showed that anthrax spores germinate in the lungs before making their way to the bloodstream. That has been a point of debate in the research community, with some speculating that spores, which are invisible to the naked eye, must first enter the blood stream and then grow into bacteria that can cause damage and death. Knowing the precise location and pathway of spore germination and understanding that the bacteria begin producing toxins that damage tissue directly in the lungs may eventually impact treatment options. The finding also likely indicates added susceptibility in individuals who already have lung issues, such as smokers or those with asthma. Making conditions real Most of what researchers know about anthrax comes from studying cancerous lung cells of both humans and rabbits because they are easy to grow in a lab. But cancer cells are very different from normal cells, which are referred to as primary cells. For this study, PNNL researchers wanted to see if normal cells reacted differently. So, they carefully cultured primary rabbit lung cells on special inserts in petri dishes, coaxing them to form small pieces of 3-D lung tissue about the size of a quarter. ""The cells are fed with nutrients from below and we trick the top layer of cells into thinking they are at the air/liquid interface as they would be in a living lung,"" said Josh Powell, a microbiologist at PNNL. Researchers observed the top layer of cells producing sticky mucus, which traps the anthrax spores. This did not occur with cells completely submerged in the growth medium where the spores just float on top. This suggests that this mucus facilitates germination of the spores into bacteria. ""Byproducts secreted in the mucus by lung cells, in reaction to the anthrax, cause the spore to proliferate very quickly,"" said Powell. ""We don't know what those byproducts are yet, but this is the first time it's been shown that growth rate is impacted by these byproducts secreted by the lungs."" Additional biochemical tests revealed that nutrients in the standard culture media provide an extra, unnatural fuel that makes spores germinate faster than would likely happen in the natural lung. ""These finding have implications for how we study pathogens within in vitro cell systems,"" said Powell. ""Understanding the impacts of the methodology ensures we get the best data we can from both species on specific rates of spore intake or dose, clearance, germination and proliferation in a lab setting."" Researchers hope to reproduce this study using the more virulent strain at DHS's National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Frederick, Md., rather than the similar but milder Sterne strain used in this study, which is virtually unable to cause illness in people or animals. Predicting to protect In the next phase of the project, researchers will put this experimental data into a computational model to more accurately predict outcomes of anthrax exposure. For instance, a model based on primary cell data may calculate how much time doctors have to initiate treatment, how many spores are likely needed to cause disease or mortality in humans, or be able to determine if there is a ""safe"" level for exposure or a required level of cleanup of a contaminated area. Once the models are refined with data from the latest experiments, those numbers will be checked against animal data to see if they are indeed predicting outcomes accurately. The models could also potentially speed future drug design. Researchers hope these fundamental findings and models can be applied to other diseases related to inhaled pathogens, such as the flu or SARS coronavirus. ""This is an investment that may eventually help officials triage, treat and influence drug discovery for these lung illnesses,"" said Powell.","Published: June 24, 2015"

They found that one of the first parts of the brain to process visual information - the primary visual cortex - can control this fast response. More complex parts of the brain are not required at this stage, contrary to what was previously thought. The findings suggest that when people look at a scene for the first time, the brain s immediate responses can categorize it based on small areas of shape and texture. Other parts of the brain then use more complex processing, which takes longer, to work out the objects being seen. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the Aix Marseille Universit  used data from previous studies in which volunteers looked at hundreds of images. They ran computer programs to mimic and analyze the processing of the primary visual cortex as the images were viewed. They showed that the program could quickly distinguish images with animals, which have more curved edges and textures, from images of outdoor scenes, which have longer, straighter edges on average. The discovery could help inform the development of image-based internet search engines, by enabling computer programs to classify images according to their geometry. It was previously thought that complex parts of the brain were required for analyzing images, with categories - such as animals - only being detectable at a late stage in the process.

""We hope to apply these findings to create prosthetic devices, such as robotic arms, that better understand and respond to a person's thoughts,"" said Jaimie Henderson, MD, professor of neurosurgery. A paper describing the study is published in the journal eLife. Henderson, who holds the John and Jene Blume-Robert and Ruth Halperin Professorship, and Krishna Shenoy, PhD, professor of electrical engineering and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, share senior authorship of the paper. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Chethan Pandarinath, PhD. The study builds on groundbreaking Stanford animal research that fundamentally has changed how scientists think about how motor cortical neurons work to control movements. ""The earlier research with animals showed that many of the firing patterns that seem so confusing when we look at individual neurons become clear when we look at large groups of neurons together as a dynamical system,"" Pandarinath said. Previously, researchers had two theories about how neurons in the motor cortex might control movement: One was that these neurons fired in patterns that represent more abstract commands, such as ""move your arm to the right,"" and then neurons in different brain areas would translate those instructions to guide the muscle contractions that make the arm move; the other was that the motor cortex neurons would actually send directions to the arm muscles, telling them how to contract. But in an animal study published in Nature in 2012, Shenoy and his colleagues reported finding that much more is going on: Motor cortical neurons work as part of an interconnected circuit -- a so-called dynamical system -- to create rhythmic patterns of neural activity. As these rhythmic patterns are sent to the arm, they drive muscle contractions, causing the arm to move. ""What we discovered in our preclinical work is evidence of how groups of neurons coordinate and cooperate with each other in a very particular way that gives us deeper insight into how the brain is controlling the arm,"" Shenoy said. He and his colleagues wanted to know whether neurons fired similarly in humans. To conduct the study, the researchers recorded motor cortical brain activity of two research participants with ALS. The condition, which also is known as Lou Gehrig's disease, damages neurons and causes patients to lose control over their muscles. The participants, a 51-year-old woman who retained some movement in her fingers and wrists and a 54-year-old man who could still move one of his index fingers slightly, are participants in the BrainGate2 trial, which is testing a neural interface system allowing thoughts to control computer cursors, robotic arms and other assistive devices. These participants had electrode arrays implanted in their brains' motor cortex for the trial. That allowed researchers to record electrical brain activity from individual neurons while the participants moved or tried to move their fingers and wrists, which were equipped with sensors to record physical movement. Typically, such mapping in humans can only occur during brain surgery. The participants' implants provided an ""opportunity to ask important scientific questions,"" Shenoy said. The researchers found that the ALS patients' neurons worked very similarly to the preclinical research findings. Researchers now plan to use their data to improve the algorithms that translate neural activity in the form of electrical impulses into control signals that can guide a robotic arm or a computer cursor.

It's important to be flexible. Take, for example, Corina Logan, whose work focuses on the cognitive abilities of the great-tailed grackle, a member of the blackbird family. A junior research fellow at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)'s SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind when she conducted her research, Logan sought to find a way to accurately approximate the brain size of live grackles by measuring their heads rather than the inside of their skulls. Instead, she discovered that the method biologists and other scientists have been using to compare brain size across species is not appropriate for looking at individual differences within a species -- particularly this species. Her findings, supported by the National Geographic Society/Waitt Grants Program, are published in the scholarly journal PeerJ. ""People love to study brain size,"" said Logan, currently a Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge. ""It's a huge topic. And there is growing interest in how brain size varies within a species, which can tell us what factors contribute to the evolution of large brains."" To understand what's going on within a species, Logan continued, you have to know how to measure their brains. And if you want to study wild species without killing your subjects, you have to figure out a way to measure their brains without removing them from their respective skulls. ""That's what I was trying to do -- study them in the wild after measuring them so I could see whether their brain size influences their behavior or the number of offspring they have,"" she explained. ""I was trying to measure brain size without measuring their actual brains."" So Logan and co-author Christin Palmstrom, an undergraduate student in biology when the research was conducted, acquired skulls from museums and measured them via two methods: They used CT scans to measure the volume of the inside of the braincase and they used calipers to measure the external skull. The scanned the skulls and then used computer software to calculate the endocranial volume, which, according to Logan, is a common proxy for brain size. The CT scan was the more accurate method for calculating endocranial volume, to which they compared length, width and height measurements the made using the calipers. ""If the external skull measurements matched the volumes from the CT scans well enough, then we could use the CT scan or caliper methods interchangeably,"" Logan said. They don't. According to Logan, it's impossible to approximate brain size using the external skull measurement because it varies so much within this species. That was surprising to her on a couple of levels. ""First, I was surprised that the external skull measurements did not accurately predict the actual endocranial volumes,"" she said. ""But I was also surprised that there was so much variation, particularly in males."" Scientists don't generally publish negative results -- i.e. not finding what they're looking for -- but in this case, Logan's unexpected result is quite interesting. She demonstrated that the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, which is commonly used to measure the degree to which two variables relate to each other (such as the two indirect measures of brain size), is not the right test to apply to these data. It overlooks differences in the individual data points, she noted, which was the whole point of the study. ""People see a 'significant correlation' between two sets of measurements and think it works,"" Logan said. ""But it's often not a very tight correlation. There is an overreliance on any level of correlation as long as it's significant."" So Logan decided to try a different analysis to confirm -- or not -- how well the external skull measurements approximate endocranial volume calculations. Her question: If you gather data from new skulls, how well will these external skull measurements predict endocranial volume using the CT scan method if you don't actually CT scan the skulls? ""What I found is that if you plug in a new number, you can't tell it apart from the other numbers in the data set because the prediction intervals for most of the data points overlapped with each other,"" she said. ""So the external skull measurements aren't helpful. They don't tell us what their brain size actually is."" The results, she added, emphasize the importance of validating and explicitly quantifying the predictive accuracy of brain size proxies for each species and sex. According to Logan, scientists can no longer take for granted what has previously been determined as accurate and correct. ""Statistical methods in biology are in flux right now,"" she said. ""People are switching from using statistics based on p-values, like the Pearson correlation, to methods that allow one to look at the finer details of the effects occurring in the data set."" Key to the success of this research, according to Logan was UCSB's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER), which preserves and manages multiple natural history collections, including plants, animals, algae and diatoms. This 'amazing resource,' as she described it, enabled Palmstrom, to gather the necessary data for the research project. And for that she needed a large enough number of intact grackle skulls for this species, which aren't available in California. ""Christin was doing some volunteer work at CCBER and found out they could borrow the specimens from other museums,"" said Logan. In this case, CCBER borrowed grackle skulls from the Museum of Southwestern Biology in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute to complete the sample size, which also included one skull from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. ""So Christin would wait for the skulls to arrive and then go to CCBER to measure them,' Logan went on. 'Collections manager Mireia Beas-Moix handled everything and helped us find more skulls. Usually research dollars are tight and no one has the resources to offer assistance like this, but CCBER was a wealth of support."" In her work, Logan studies live birds rather than skeletons, but as she said, ""Working with museum specimens can fill a really important piece of the puzzle for me.""

The honor was revealed during the annual Design of the Year awards ceremony, held on the evening of June 22 at the Design Museum of London, which marked the culmination of the 8th annual awards and museum exhibition. ""This winning design is a great example of how design is a collaborative practice embracing expertise and know how across disciplines. Its selection as Design of the Year 2015 also signifies a desire to recognize and award design that can significantly impact society now and in the future,"" said Gemma Curtin, who is the Designs of the Year 2015 exhibition curator. The ceremony not only named human organs on chips as the overall winner but also as the winner of the Product design category, in addition to honoring other winners who received awards representing five other design categories including Architecture, Digital, Fashion, Graphics, and Transport. Selected from an initial group of 76 nominees chosen by top design experts, practitioners, curators and academics to represent the world s most innovative, high-impact, and forward thinking designs, the category winners had comprised six finalists that were evaluated for the overall award by a jury chaired by the artist Anish Kapoor.  Human organs on chips received their nomination from Paola Antonelli, the Museum of Modern Art's Senior Curator of Architecture & Design and Director of R&D. ""This is the epitome of design innovation   elegantly beautiful form, arresting concept and pioneering application,"" said Antonelli.  Wyss Institute Senior Staff Scientist Anthony Bahinski, Ph.D., MBA, FAHA, who has been instrumental to the development and translation of the technology, attended the awards ceremony and accepted the Product and Design of the Year awards on behalf of Wyss Founding Director Donald E. Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., and former Wyss Technology Development Fellow Dan Dongeun Huh, Ph.D., who collaborated and first designed the initial human organ on a chip in 2010. Ingber   whose earliest scientific work led to the discovery that tensegrity architecture, first described by architect Buckminster Fuller and sculptor Kenneth Snelson, is a fundamental design principle that controls how biological systems are structured   founded the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering in 2009 with the mission to draw inspiration from the way Nature builds to develop innovative bioinspired technologies that improve human health and the environment. ""This is an extremely meaningful moment, as the intersection of science and design has been a constant source of inspiration throughout my career,"" said Ingber. ""To have the microscopic elegance and function of human organs on chips recognized in an international design forum is a powerful testament to the breadth and depth at which design principles contribute to biological function as well as technological advancement, and it is a recognition for which I am deeply honored to receive on behalf of the Wyss Institute."" Since Ingber and Huh initially designed the first organ on a chip, the lung on a chip, several additional human organs on chips have been developed at the Institute thanks to the efforts of a multidisciplinary team of Wyss scientists. The microdevices have the potential ability to deliver transformative change to pharmaceutical development and human healthcare due to the accuracy at which they emulate human organ level functions. They stand to significantly reduce the need for animal testing by providing a faster, less expensive, less controversial and accurate means to predict whether new drug compounds will be successful in human clinical trials. To achieve the ultimate goal of translating the technology, the startup company Emulate, Inc., sprang out of the Wyss Institute in 2014 to commercialize human organs on chips.  Human organs on chips are built using an innovative microfabrication process adapted from the computer chip industry, in which photolithography is used to manufacture memory stick sized blocks of crystal clear, flexible rubber that contain hollow microchannels. These microchannels are then lined with living organ cells and blood capillary cells under fluid flow and manipulated mechanically using vacuum powered movements to replicate organ movements.  ""One of the most important things about the Designs of the Year award is the chance that it gives the museum to explore new territory,"" said Deyan Sudjic, who is the Director of the Design Museum. ""The team of scientists that produced this remarkable object don't come from a conventional design background. But what they have done is clearly a brilliant piece of design. They identified a serious problem   how do we predict how human cells will behave   and they solved it with elegance and economy of means, putting technology from apparently unrelated fields to work in new ways. They have perhaps unintentionally created something that for a lay man seems to symbolize the essence of life and also happens to be beautiful to look at."" As the 2015 recipient of the Design of the Year Award, the human organs on chips design is the latest winner in the annual award series.

Living tissues rely on their ability to package, transport and secrete liquid, where and when it's needed. Nature's secretion system is responsive, self-regulatory, and intrinsically linked with its surroundings but synthetic systems haven't been able to replicate that complexity until now. The new system was developed in the lab of Joanna Aizenberg, the Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). Aizenberg is also professor in the Dept. of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, co-director of the Kavli Institute for Bionano Science and Technology, and a core faculty member at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, leading the Adaptive Materials Technologies platform there. The new system, self-assembled through phase separation, consists of liquid droplets inside a supramolecular polymer gel with a thin layer of liquid on its surface. When the surface liquid is removed or depleted, the droplets spontaneously release only enough fluid to replace what is lost on the surface. ""Current fluid secretion technologies are generally designed with one-time only release mechanisms. Once the fluid is released, it continues flowing, at a consistent pace, until the supply is exhausted, regardless of the needs of its surroundings,"" said Aizenberg. ""These kinds of triggered releases aren't responsive to the consumption of fluid. Our system ties fluid secretion to fluid consumption and controls for when and how much liquid is secreted at a time."" The feature is an advance for material application, especially the non-stick, slippery material known as SLIPS (Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces) developed in the Aizenberg lab. ""This system opens the way to create dynamic designer polymers that are capable of self-relubrication and highly regulated and long-lasting anti-fouling behavior,"" said Jiaxi Cui, a postdoctoral fellow in Aizenberg's lab and a lead author of the paper. Instability is the key to this system's success. Just as in nature, the secretion system developed by Aizenberg and her team is out of equilibrium, unstable enough to adapt and respond to its surroundings. The supramolecular polymers are reversibly bonded to each other, meaning they can come apart to allow the liquid to filter through the matrix, then stitch themselves back together and adjust to the shrinking liquid reserves. This is a major step forward in the design of self-healing materials. ""There is a whole class of self-healing polymers out there, but most can't stitch themselves together if there is a big gash down the middle,"" said Daniel Daniel, a graduate student in Aizenberg's lab and coauthor on the paper. ""Polymers can't fly through the air but they can swim through liquid."" When this system is cut down the middle, the newly exposed polymer surface signals droplets to secrete liquid, quickly filling in the crack and bridging the ends of the broken polymers. Over time, the polymer strands will swim through the liquid and stitch themselves back together. Like the gauge on a gas tank, the system can self-report its liquid levels. As the fluid is secreted, the gel becomes more transparent. The system could also be used to improve drug delivery systems. Certain drugs, such as those used to treat cancer, are harmful if released all at one. A system that could not only tell a chemical where and when to release, but how quickly to release, could have a major impact on certain treatments. The Aizenberg lab is at the forefront of this kind of adaptable and responsive material science. ""For years, material scientists created static materials and then tried to figure out how to get them to change as an afterthought,"" Aizenberg said. ""Now, the direction of material science is to look at nature and recognize that nature has already invented sophisticated responsive, dynamical material systems, and we can take inspiration from that.""","Published: June 23, 2015"

Chien says that because controlled protein degradation is critical for bacterial virulence, ""this work introduces new pathways for us to target in the discovery of sorely needed new antibiotics."" In bacteria, the cell cycle is very tightly controlled by protein-digesting enzymes called proteases that selectively destroy other proteins, called substrates, at appropriate times while the cell is undergoing growth and division. At the same time, another process called phosphorylation chemically modifies different proteins to regulate their activity in a cell-cycle-dependent way, Chien explains. Although the energy-dependent proteases that carry out most protein degradation can directly recognize some substrates, biological regulation often requires additional factors known as adaptors to be present to ""tune"" substrate selection more precisely. In the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus studied in the Chien lab, one of these adaptors, a small protein called CpdR, is specifically phosphorylated at different times in the cell cycle. Previous studies had shown that the timing of this phosphorylation correlated with the degradation of many proteins by a protease called ClpXP. Chien says, ""Before this work, we thought most adaptors were binding to the protease and substrate at the same time, effectively leashing them together to force them to interact. Surprisingly, Joanne found that CpdR bound principally to the ClpXP protease, but didn't seem to bind the substrate well at all. Instead, CpdR binding to the ClpXP protease prepared, or primed, the protease for engaging substrates. This primed protease was now also able to recruit additional adaptors that could deliver even more protease substrates."" He adds, ""By not specifically interacting with any single substrate, this new mechanism of protease priming allows for surprisingly broad recognition of both substrates and additional regulators. This mechanism lets the cell control multiple pathways with a single regulator, which is useful when bacteria have to respond rapidly, such as during the stress they undergo when treated with antibiotics. However, this could also lead to unwanted degradation of off-target proteins. Understanding this balance of specificity and broad recognition is an outstanding question."" Chien and Lau say the ""fascinating mystery"" at the heart of this work has been to figure out how the cell cycle, made up of the many events that happen when cells divide, are so precisely coordinated by CpdR and other factors. The researchers say their new understanding of how adaptors work could answer the question of how a single regulator like CpdR could globally control degradation by a protease, ClpXP.","Published: June 23, 2015"

That s the kind of surprise scientists at the Salk Institute experienced with their recent discovery that nucleoporins proteins that act as cellular  doorways  to help manage what goes in and out of a cell s nucleus are actually much bigger players in expressing genes than previously thought. The finding shows that nucleoporins play an important role in maintaining embryonic stem cells before they begin to develop into specific tissues. This discovery gives a new understanding to genetic diseases that are caused by mutations in these proteins. One nucleoporin protein in particular has a dramatic and unanticipated function in the formation of neurons from stem cells.  We ve shone a new light on this class of proteins,  said Martin Hetzer, a professor in Salk s Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory and senior author of the new paper.  I hope people start to accept and realize that nucleoporins are more than just transport proteins.  Nucleoporins of which there are about 30 versions are typically part of nuclear pore complexes, giant structures that connect the inside of a cell s nucleus to the outer cytoplasm. In 2010, Hetzer s team first uncovered hints that nucleoporins may also have a role in regulating the timing of when genes inside the nucleus are transcribed into proteins during a cell s development. But exactly what that role might be was unclear. In the new work, Hetzer and his colleagues focused on one particular nucleoporin called Nup153, which is known to rapidly move on and off of the nuclear pore complex, suggesting it might be doing something other than providing structural support to the pore. The researchers turned to mouse embryonic stem cells cells that have the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the body and deleted Nup153. They expected that if Nup153 played a key role in cell differentiation, then removing it from stem cells would stop them from differentiating. Instead, the opposite happened.  The big surprise was that when we took out this gene, the stem cells started to differentiate,  said Hetzer.  And not only did they start to differentiate, but they started to differentiate into neurons.   Nup153, researchers discovered, put the brakes on certain genes that need to be turned on for stem cells to turn into brain cells. When the brakes are lifted, the stem cells start differentiating.  This study not only revealed a critical function for nucleoporins in mediating the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells by silencing neural genes, but also introduced new mechanistic directions for elucidating the role of these proteins during mammalian development,  said Filipe Jacinto, a postdoctoral researcher in Hetzer s lab and first author of the paper. Hetzer suspects that other nucleoporins also have roles in gene expression control, but cautions that the roles could be very different each nucleoporin, he said, likely targets a different set of genes, and some might activate the genes rather than repress them. Mutations in many nucleoporin genes has been linked to human diseases and developmental disorders, including some forms of leukemia and inherited heart problems. Until now, Hetzer said, researchers have assumed the mutations led to disease by altering the transport of proteins in and out of a cell s nucleus.  Now, we re realizing this is probably not the only explanation,  he said.  Many of those diseases and developmental disorders might actually be caused by the ability of these genes to regulate gene expression programs.  His lab is planning to follow up with studies on Nup153, and exactly how it s recruited to genes, as well as investigating the developmental roles of other nucleoporins","Published: June 23, 2015"

Health Minister Cameron Dick said that this work being undertaken by the Institute of Molecular Bioscience showed that Queensland could become a centre of international research excellence.  The whole Smart State agenda set up by previous Labor Governments was always one for the long term, and what we re seeing now is some of the end results of that concerted push,  he said.  Queensland needs to diversify its economy, and one of our major strengths is a well-trained and well-educated workforce.  The institute has been able to attract well-renowned researchers from around the world, and they know that they will have talented people working with them.  CO-ADD will screen compounds against strains of bacteria and fungi that cause life-threatening infections, with all results made available to the research community.

Manning and Kelemen studied how carbon, the chemical basis of all known life, behaves in a variety of tectonic settings. They assessed, among other factors, how much carbon is added to Earth's crust and how much carbon is released into the atmosphere. The new model combines measurements, predictions and calculations. Their research includes analysis of existing data on samples taken at sites around the world as well as new data from Oman. The carbon  budget  near the Earth's surface exerts important controls on global climate change and our energy resources, and has important implications for the origin and evolution of life, Manning said. Yet much more carbon is stored in the deep Earth. The surface carbon that is so important to us is made available chiefly by volcanic processes originating deep in the planet's interior. Today carbon can return to Earth's deep interior only by subduction the geologic process by which one tectonic plate moves under another tectonic plate and sinks into the Earth's mantle. Previous research suggested that roughly half of the carbon stored in subducted oceanic mantle, crust and sediments makes it into the deep mantle. Kelemen and Manning's new analysis suggests instead that subduction may return almost no carbon to the mantle, and that  exchange between the deep interior and surface reservoirs is in balance.  Some carbon must make it past subduction zones. Diamonds form in the mantle both from carbon that has never traveled to Earth's surface, known as primordial carbon, and from carbon that has cycled from the mantle to the surface and back again, known as recycled carbon. Manning and Kelemen corroborated their findings with a calculation based on the characteristics of diamonds, which form from carbon in the earth's mantle. Deep carbon is important because the carbon at the Earth's surface, on which we depend, ""exists only by permission of the deep Earth,"" Manning said, quoting a friend. At times in the Earth's history, the planet has been warmer (in the Cretaceous period, for example), and shallow seas covered North America.

The lead author was Larry Alan Pierce, a University of Washington research scientist in the Department of Radiology s  Imaging Research Lab. Paul E. Kinahan, UW professor of radiology, was the principal investigator. Pierce, Kinahan and their colleagues looked at software for viewing images generated by positron emission tomographic or PET scanners.  These devices create three-dimensional images of processes within the body. PET scans are most often used to detect cancers and cancer metastases and to follow tumor response to cancer treatment.  PET scans also can help assess the function of the brain, heart and other tissues.PET scans can both image tumors and show their metabolic activity. Courtesy of UW Radiology. A patient undergoing a PET scan receives a small amount of radioactive material. This isotope is bound to a molecule that is taken up and concentrated in the part of the body the clinician or researcher wants to examine, such as tumor tissue. The PET scanner detects radiation given off by the isotope. That information is then processed by software that analyzes the data. The software then produces a three-dimensional image that reveals where in the body the isotope has concentrated. In the recent study, the researchers wanted to see whether these processed images appeared the same when they were viewed with different software packages. To do this, they created a standardized image file, called a digital reference object, in which all the data values were known. They sent the file to 16 collaborating sites where the files were viewed with 21 different software packages. Their collaborators were asked to report back certain measurements from the images their viewing software generated. The results varied greatly, depending on the software package. In the case of one measurement, called the maximum voxel standardized uptake value, some software packages showed uptake that was as much as 38 percent lower than what should have been reported. By another measure, readings were off by as much as 100 percent    twice as high as they should have been.  We were surprised that these software packages, most of which are FDA-approved and some of which can cost as much as $100,000, gave such different results,  Kinahan said. It is not clear why the different software packages yielded different results, but many have algorithms to smooth or enhance images. This may result in images that do not accurately represent the data from the original PET scan file.  With these variations, it is as if you had a digital picture of a person s face and when you opened the file with one software package, say Photoshop, you see freckles on the face, but when you open it with another software package, the freckles disappear, and with yet another package the freckles are there but they re darker,  Pierce said. One remedy, Kinahan and Pierce suggest, would be for centers to adopt a standard reference file to check against. In this way, radiology staff could see whether they are getting different values from different software and make adjustments as necessary.  Ultimately, we hope that the manufacturers of medical imaging software will work together to standardize their products and reduce this variability,  Pierce said.","Published: June 23, 2015"

The test has produced encouraging results in a clinical study, and will now be tested in a larger trial involving three hospitals in London. Researchers analyzed breath samples of 210 patients using the test. They found that the test can discriminate between malignant and benign oesophageal cancer in patients for the first time. The test is 90 per cent accurate and provides results in minutes, which can take up to four to six hours to process using other methods. The test can also be applied to detect gastric (stomach) cancer tumours. According to the researchers, economic modelling showed that the test could save the NHS  145 million a year because it's cheaper, faster and easier to perform than other methods. Oesophageal and gastric malignancies account for 15 per cent of cancer-related deaths globally. Both cancers are usually diagnosed in the advanced stages because they rarely cause any noticeable symptoms when they first develop. As a result, the long-term survival rate is 13 per cent for oesophageal cancer and 15 per cent for gastric cancer in the UK. However, diagnosis of these cancers at an early stage can improve survival rates. Doctors diagnose oesophageal and gastric cancers by carrying out an endoscopy. This is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using a probe with a light source and video camera at the end via the mouth and down the gullet. However, the procedure is invasive and costs the NHS around  400- 600 per endoscopy. Only two per cent of patients who are referred for an endoscopy by GPs are diagnosed with oesophageal or gastric cancer. The first study, published in the Annals of Surgery, was carried out by an international team led by scientists at Imperial College London and clinicians at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Researchers from UCL (University College London), Keele University Medical School, Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic were also involved in the study. Now, 400 patients at UCLH (University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust), The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust will take part in a further trial. The researchers hope to use the findings from the clinical trial to create a sensor device that can signal to clinicians if a patient has a malignant tumour. Professor George Hanna, lead author of the study and Director of NIHR-Diagnostic Evidence Cooperatives at Imperial College London, said: ""Oesophageal and gastric cancers are on the rise in the UK with more than 16,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The current method for detecting these cancers is expensive, invasive and a diagnosis is usually made at a late stage and often the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This makes it harder to treat and results in poor long-term survival rates. Our breath test could address these problems because it can help diagnose patients with early non-specific symptoms as well as reduce the number of invasive endoscopies carried out on patients, which often lead to negative results. Diagnosis at an early stage could give patients more treatment options and ultimately save more lives."" The test looks for chemical compounds in exhaled breath that are unique to patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer. The cancers produce a distinctive smell of volatile organic compounds (VOC), chemicals that contain carbon and are found in all living things, which can help doctors detect early signs of the disease. Researchers were able to identify for the first time the number of VOCs in breath samples by using a selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer, an analytical instrument used to identify what chemicals are present in a sample. This quantitative technology identified VOCs that were present at significantly higher concentrations in patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer than in non-cancerous patients. The researchers say that the results could be used to set a biomarker, a biological feature used to measure the presence or progress of a disease. To take the test, patients breathe into a device similar to a breathalyzer which is connected to a bag. The compounds in their exhaled breath are analyzed by a selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer. The researchers used breath samples of patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust from 2011 to 2013. Patients who are at risk of developing these cancers and those who had benign tumours were also tested. Similar breath tests to discriminate between benign and malignant tumours exist but researchers say they have lengthy processing times and are unable to quantify the amounts of VOCs present in exhaled breath. The research was funded by NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre and NIHR-diagnostic Evidence Cooperatives.","Published: June 23, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/reducing-uncertainties-in-genetic-tests-207060,Reducing Uncertainties in Genetic Tests Breast cancer associated gene study shows potential to sort out harmful and harmless variants  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Patients seeking certainty in genetic tests often receive a perplexing result. Many learn they carry a variant of unknown significance of a disease-linked gene. Such variants might or might not increase disease risk. A recently published study characterized nearly 2000 variants of the breast cancer-associated gene BRCA1. The findings demonstrate the potential of a new approach for sorting out which variants are harmful and which are harmless.  Because genetic tests increasingly use more comprehensive multi-gene and whole-genome sequencing methods, it s becoming more common for patients to learn they carry a variant of unknown significance. For example, a 2014 study showed 42 percent of breast cancer patients who received results from a 25-gene hereditary cancer genetic test carried a variant of unknown significance in one of the scanned genes.  There s not much you can do with this information, except worry,  said first author Lea Starita, a research scientist in genome sciences at the University of Washington.  We hope to reduce some of the uncertainty by driving forward technologies for efficient functional testing of gene variants.  The team used the BRCA1 gene as a test case for their approach because more is known about the functions and sequence variants of BRCA1 than many other genes associated with disease. Normally, BRCA1 codes for a protein that regulates how the body repairs DNA mutations. People who carry a BRCA1 variant known to be linked to disease have a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancers because the encoded protein is faulty. It fails to properly regulate DNA repair and allows cancer-causing mutations to accumulate. But not all BRCA1 variants cause cancer.  Medical researchers can t usually tell whether a gene variant confers a higher disease risk until enough people with the variant have been identified to allow statistical analysis of their disease rates. For extremely rare or unique variants, such studies might never be possible. To better understand new or rare variants, the authors proposed an approach that doesn t directly examine disease risks.  Instead, it measures the function of the gene s protein product. The encoded protein is tested with relatively simple laboratory assays that gauge whether the protein retains its normal biochemical functions. By performing many thousands of these tests at once, biologists can assess all possible variants of a gene quickly and efficiently.  Such laboratory tests are not perfect measures of whether or not a particular variant is functional. Proteins sometimes behave differently inside the human body than they do in a test tube, a laboratory organism, or a cell growing in a dish.  Starita emphasized that, although the results of their approach show remarkable promise, the data are not yet ready for use in the clinic.  Clinicians can t use the data in isolation to make conclusions about a variant,  she said.  Our model, based on experimental data, is a better predictor of the effects of mutations than those based on purely computational methods, but it is still not perfect.  The team is working on large-scale approaches for other genes. For example, many genetic variants linked to autism are located in genes that alter the packaging of DNA into a compact form called chromatin. The researchers are developing massively parallel assays for chromatin remodeling that could be used to assess the function of many autism-associated variants. The researchers are also using new genome editing technologies to create thousands of genetic variants directly in the genomes of cells growing in culture. These technologies would allow other biochemical tests of protein function   such as protein-protein interaction, enzyme catalysis, and protein stability   to be performed at enormous scales.  As genetic testing becomes both cheaper and more comprehensive, we will need a variety of approaches to translate the deluge of genetic data into practical information on individual health risks,  says Starita.  Deep mutational scans are one tool to help meet this urgent need.","Published: June 23, 2015"

UT Southwestern biochemists studying mouse models found that the two proteins - steroid receptor coactivators 1 and 2 (SRC-1 and SRC-2) - control genes for pulmonary surfactant components.  Our study provides compelling evidence that the fetus regulates the timing of its birth, and that this control occurs after these two gene regulatory proteins   SRC-1 and SRC-2   increase the production of surfactant components, surfactant protein A and platelet activating factor,  said senior author Dr. Carole Mendelson, Professor of Biochemistry, and Obstetrics and Gynecology at UT Southwestern.  By understanding the factors and pathways that initiate normal-term labor at 40 weeks, we can gain more insight into how to prevent preterm labor,  said Dr. Mendelson, Director. Each year about one in every nine infants in the United States is born preterm (before 37 weeks), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Premature birth can cause brain hemorrhage and respiratory distress for babies, as well as long-term conditions such as cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, and impaired vision. The study, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, was supported by the National Institutes of Health and a Prematurity Research Initiative grant from the March of Dimes Foundation. UT Southwestern researchers found that the proteins SRC-1 and SRC-2 activate genes inside the fetus  lungs near full term, resulting in an increased production of surfactant components, surfactant protein A (SP-A), and platelet-activating factor (PAF). Both SP-A and PAF are then secreted by the fetus  lungs into the amniotic fluid, leading to an inflammatory response in the mother s uterus that initiates labor. The current study showed that a deficiency of both SRC-1 and SRC-2 inside the fetus  lungs drastically decreased the production of SP-A and PAF, causing a one- to two-day labor delay in mouse models, comparable to a three- to four-week labor delay in women. Researchers further found that injecting either SP-A or PAF into the amniotic fluid of the deficient mice allowed the mothers to deliver on time. Together, the findings further define the underlying molecular mechanisms by which fetuses control the timing of birth. Future research will include defining how fetal signals are transmitted to the mother s uterus, and relating these findings to the causes of preterm labor.","Published: June 23, 2015"

Adult heart muscle is comprised of cells called cardiomyocytes. Most cardiomyocytes don t replenish themselves after a heart attack or other significant heart muscle damage. The UT Southwestern researchers were able to devise a new cell-tracing technique, allowing them to detect cells that do replenish themselves after being damaged.  We identified a cell that generates new heart muscle cells. This cell does not appear to be a stem cell, but rather a specialized cardiomyocyte, or heart muscle cell, that can divide, which the majority of cardiomyocytes cannot do,  said Dr. Hesham Sadek, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and with the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine. Previous research by UT Southwestern scientists revealed that it is the highly oxygenated environment of the heart that prevents most heart muscle cells from dividing. The researchers reasoned that the cells that do divide must, therefore, be low on oxygen, which is a condition called hypoxic. They then devised a technique to identify and trace the lineage of hypoxic cells. That technique led them to the identification of the proliferating cells within heart muscle.  For decades, researchers have been trying to find the specialized cells that make new muscle cells in the adult heart, and we think that we have found that cell,  said Dr. Sadek, senior author of the study, which appears online in Nature.  Now we have a target to study. If we can expand this cell population, or make it divide more, then we can make new muscle cells. This is what this cell does naturally, and we can now work toward harnessing this ability to make new heart muscle when the heart has been damaged.  The researchers found hypoxic microenvironments with proliferating cells scattered throughout the heart muscle. They found the rate of formation of new cells to be between 0.3 percent and 1 percent annually.  This is exciting work from both scientific and methodological standpoints,  said Dr. Joseph Hill, Chief of the Division of Cardiology and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern, who holds the James T. Willerson, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Diseases and the Frank M. Ryburn, Jr. Chair in Heart Research.  Dr. Sadek s discovery points to a novel mechanism of cell-cycle control in cardiac myocytes and lends credence to the potential for regenerating   rebuilding   the diseased heart.  The new technique used to find the regenerative cells, a process called fate mapping, is an equally important development that may prove useful for distinguishing similar regenerating cells in other organs, as well as in cancers, the researchers said. Traditional fate mapping, which is somewhat like developing a family tree for cells, labels cells based on the expression of a certain gene. That didn t work for the hypoxic cells, which are mainly regulated at the protein level rather than the gene-expression level. Instead, the researchers developed a sophisticated protein-tracking technique based on the presence of a hypoxia-responsive protein called Hif-1alpha. Researchers developed a genetically modified mouse in which the Hif-1alpha protein is fused to another protein, called Cre recombinase, which could then be used for cellular labeling.  This fate-mapping approach, based on protein stabilization rather than gene expression, is an important tool for studying hypoxia in the whole organism. It can identify any hypoxic cell, not just cardiomyocytes, so this has broad implications for cellular turnover in any organ, and even in cancer,  said Dr. Sadek, whose lab focuses on cardiac regeneration and stem cell metabolism.","Published: June 23, 2015"

Researchers at ReNeuron and Benitec have discovered that ReNeuron s CTX-derived exosomes are potentially an effective delivery system for Benitec s proprietary ddRNAi gene silencing technology, resulting in the silencing of specific genes in recipient cells to beneficial therapeutic effect. These early studies also indicate that ReNeuron s CTX stem cells are a more effective producer cell type for this purpose than mesenchymal cells, a widely used cell type against disease targets in stem cell therapy. Following these exploratory studies, ReNeuron is extending its research collaboration with Benitec in order to further test the potential of this combination technology approach, targeting lung cancer and other drug resistant cancers. ReNeuron is a first-mover in the field of exosome-based therapeutics and has filed multiple patent applications covering the composition, manufacture and therapeutic use of its exosome nanomedicine platform. Exosomes are nanoparticles secreted from all cells and which are believed to play a key role in the transfer of beneficial proteins and particularly non-coding RNAs from one cell to another. ReNeuron aims to exploit the therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from its own proprietary stem cell lines. Dr Peter French, Chief Executive Officer of Benitec, commented:  We are delighted to be working with ReNeuron in this exciting emerging field of gene- and cell-based therapeutics. The application of Benitec s ddRNAi technology to ReNeuron s stem cell and exosome platforms represents a unique technology combination and opens up a wide array of possibilities for extending both companies  core platforms into new therapeutic areas. Having ReNeuron as a collaborator on this approach increases the chances of success as their knowledge of stem cell science coupled with their unique technology platforms are tremendous assets in this area.

This same algorithm also explains why we are fooled by several motion-related optical illusions, including the sudden ""break"" of baseball's well known ""curveball illusion."" The new open-access study published in PNAS shows that our brains apply an algorithm, known as a Kalman filter, when tracking an object's position. This algorithm helps the brain process less than perfect visual signals, such as when objects move to the periphery of our visual field where acuity is low. However, the same algorithm that helps our brain track motion can be tricked by the pattern motion of an object, such as the seams on a spinning baseball, which causes our brain to ""see"" the ball suddenly drop from its path when, in reality, it curves steadily. Though we often rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) to get us to our destination, the accuracy of GPS is limited. When the signal is ""noisy"" or unreliable, your phone's GPS uses algorithms, including the Kalman filter, to estimate the location of your car based on its past position and speed. ""Like GPS, our visual ability, although quite impressive, has many limitations,"" said the study's coauthor, Duje Tadin, associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester. We see an object's position with great accuracy when it's in the center of our visual field. We do poorly, however, at perceiving position when it shifts into our visual periphery; then our estimate of its position becomes unreliable. When that happens, our brain gives greater emphasis to our perception of the object's motion. ""And, this is where we start seeing fascinating phenomena like the curveball illusion,"" said Tadin. ""We've found that the same algorithm that is used by GPS to track vehicles also explains why we perceive the curveball illusion."" ""A curveball pitch does indeed curve,"" said the first author Oh-Sang Kwon, assistant professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea. ""But when it is viewed in the visual periphery, the spin of the ball--the motion of the seam pattern--can make it appear to be in a different location than it really is. ""Here, the brain 'knows' that position estimates are unreliable in the periphery, so it relies more on other visual cues, which, in this case, is the motion; the spin of the ball,"" said Kwon, who led the study while serving as a research associate in the Center for Visual Science at the University of Rochester. The perceived motion and position of the curveball depends on where it is in your visual field. So, when the ball enters your periphery, it appears to make an abrupt shift: The infamous and sudden ""break"" of the curveball as it nears home plate. The Kalman filter algorithm, named after its coinventor, mathematician Rudolph Kalman, is used to find optimal and integrated solutions from noisy or unreliable data whether in GPS or our brains. Most of the time our vision does a really good job, but in some cases, such as a breaking curveball, the optimal solution that our brain comes up with belies the actual behavior--and trajectory--of the ball, and the result is an optical illusion. Therefore, Tadin explained, you have a better chance of hitting a curveball by realizing that our brains, like GPS, can lead us to ""see"" changes in speed or direction that don't actually occur when the ball moves from the center of our visual field to the periphery. ""These illusions should not be seen as evidence that our brains are poor at perceiving the world around us, though,"" explained Tadin. ""They are interesting side-effects of neural processes that, in most cases, are extremely efficient at processing 'noisy' visual information."" ""This study shows that the solutions that the brain finds for dealing with imperfect information often match optimal solutions that engineers have come up with for similar problems, like your phone's GPS.""

The antithesis being those, who we secretly hate, that pop out of bed refreshed, ready to start the day, and on seemingly less than the seven to eight hours of sleep that the rest of the population needs to function. Do these perky morning risers have a better mattress than the rest of us? Are they better at counting sheep? Do they possess magical sleeping potions? Instead, perhaps the difference among these populations is largely due to genetic variability. Researchers from the Farber Institute for Neuroscience at Thomas Jefferson University are siding with the genetic variability theory.  ""There's a lot we don't understand about sleep, especially when it comes to the protein machinery that initiates the process on the cellular level,"" explained Kyunghee Koh, Ph.D., assistant professor of neuroscience at the Farber Institute for Neurosciences at Thomas Jefferson University and senior author on the study. ""Our research elucidates a new molecular pathway and a novel brain area that play a role in controlling how long we sleep."" Using a forward genetic screen, the researchers examined thousands of mutant fly lines and isolated a gene, Taranis, which they classified as a novel sleep gene associated with a marked reduction in total sleep time. Moreover, when the Jefferson team tracked how Taranis interacted with other proteins, they observed that it bound to a known sleep regulator, Cyclin A suggesting that Taranis and Cyclin A create a molecular machine that inactivates Cdk1, an enzyme whose normal function is to suppress sleep and promote wakefulness. Previous research into the molecular mechanisms of sleep has shown that Cyclin A is expressed in a small number of neurons located in an area of the fly brain that is analogous to the human hypothalamus, a well-known sleep center of the human brain. Additionally, Dr. Koh s team able to knockdown Taranis within Drosophila and localize sleep activity to discreet clusters of neurons on both sides of the fly s brain.   ""We think this may be an arousal center in the fly brain that Taranis helps inhibit during sleep,"" stayed Dr.Koh. Dr. Koh and her team were excited about their findings, but understand that they have a long road ahead of them to determine if this mechanism is relevant within the human brain. Interestingly though, the Taranis protein does have a human homolog called the Trip-Br family of transcriptional activators, yet it is unclear as to the role, if any, this protein has in human sleep cycle.","Published: June 22, 2015"

All of the meat products were frozen at -20  C and sent to the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge for testing. After thawing, researchers disinfected the exterior packaging before removing the meat. They then tested a 10g sample of meat from each packet and screened for MRSA. Two of the pork samples   one from sausages, one from minced pork   tested positive for MRSA; the sausage sample contained two strains of the bacteria. In collaboration with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute an analysis of the genetic make-up of the bacteria and confirmed the presence of antibiotic resistant genes. The analysis showed that the bacteria belonged to a type of MRSA known as LA-MRSA CC398, which has emerged over the last few years in continental Europe, particularly in pigs and poultry, but was not previously believed to be widely distributed in the UK. In many countries, LA-MRSA CC398 represents an occupational risk for those in close contact with livestock, particularly pigs and veal calves. Humans in contact with pigs (farm workers, abattoir workers and veterinarians, etc.) have significantly higher rates of the bacteria in their nasal carriage, according to epidemiological studies, for example. Other studies have revealed an association between clinical disease resulting from LA-MRSA CC398 infection and recent contact with pigs or pig farms. As with other MRSA, this type may be responsible for serious illness following wound or surgery site infections, although many people will carry MRSA on their skin or in their noses without showing signs of disease. The researchers stress that adequate cooking (heating above 71 C) and hygienic precautions during food preparation should minimise the likelihood of transmission to humans via contaminated pork. However, they argue that the discovery of MRSA in pork identifies a potential way that the bacteria can spread from farms to the wider population.  While human contamination of carcasses or meat products in the abattoir or at the meat packing plant may occur, there is good evidence that these isolates are of animal origin   possibly through the use of antibiotics to treat or control infection in livestock. As the tests use a highly sensitive method of detection of bacterial contamination, the numbers of MRSA bacteria present may be low. The researchers say that as the two infected samples contained processed pork (sausages and minced pork), they cannot rule out that the meat packing plants from which the MRSA from this study originated also handle imported meat. If this were the case, it is conceivable that cross-contamination might have occurred between non-UK to UK sourced meat.  Dr Mark Holmes from the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge said:  This is the first time that MRSA has been detected in retail meat products in the UK. The public should not be overly worried by this as sensible food precautions and good hygiene should prevent its spread. It s also usually pretty harmless and only causes health problems if it infects someone in poor health or gets into a wound.   However, this does suggest that MRSA is established in our pig farms and provides a possible route of transmission from livestock, through those in direct contact with pigs, into the wider population.  Dr Des Walsh, Head of Infections and Immunity at the MRC, added:  Studies like this are crucial not just to reveal concerns to human health through contaminated livestock, but to show resistance to antibiotics is a problem growing far beyond just humans. To win the fight against antimicrobial resistance, we need an all hands on deck approach, and that s why we ve teamed up with leading experts in biological, social and others sciences in a joint initiative designed to find new solutions, fast.

Within these samples, they saw DNA communities that differed from those previously identified in freshwater samples from the Antarctic. Nevertheless, the team noted that some features of the viromes at each pole did overlap; apparently arguing against the notion that viral diversity follows a continuous, north-to-south gradient. ""Viral communities in the Arctic and Antarctic freshwater ecosystems share taxonomic composition of viruses, dominated by unknown and small [single-stranded DNA] viruses, but show very low fine-grain genetic overlap,"" senior author Antonio Alcam , a researcher with Madrid's Centro de Biolog a Molecular, and his co-authors wrote. ""Our comparative analysis sheds light into the global biogeography and connectivity of viral communities,"" they concluded, ""and highlights not only the uniqueness of the polar environment but also the differences between Arctic and Antarctic microbial ecosystems, despite their exposure to similar environmental conditions."" Despite their ecological importance, the makeup of viral communities found in many different types of environments is largely uncharacterized, the researchers noted. For the current study, they focused on viromes from freshwater sites in the far north that are microbe-rich and relatively untouched by human development. ""High-altitude freshwater habitats constitute a unique ecological model to understand the influence of viruses on natural microbial communities and the overall ecosystem,"" the study's authors explained. ""However, no large-scale analysis has yet assessed the diversity and composition of the Arctic freshwater virome."" The team did shotgun metagenomic sequencing on purified DNA virus particles in samples from six bodies of water in Norway in 2010, 2011, and/or 2012. Samples from all but one of the water bodies were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq instruments. The researchers sequenced the remaining samples with Roche 454 FLX technology. They also did Illumina re-sequencing on samples from a lake in the Antarctic that were considered for a study published in Science in 2009. When the team delved into sequences from the Arctic lakes, it saw an abundance of single-stranded DNA viruses, which made up some 86 percent of the DNA viruses detected in the samples. More than one-third of the single-stranded DNA viruses belonged to the Circoviridae family. The remaining viral community components included both double-stranded DNA viruses, along with sequences that most closely resembled single-stranded RNA viruses, the researchers reported. Some of the Arctic lakes shared more virome features than others, they noted. But despite the diversity detected at these sites, the viral sequence contigs in the Arctic samples typically clustered together   and apart from viral communities in samples from the Antarctic, Arctic Ocean, and elsewhere.  Similarities with viromes from freshwater samples collected in the Antarctic during the spring did turn up when the group compared more general taxonomic features such as representation by single-stranded DNA viruses, unknown viruses, and viruses from specific lineages.","Published: June 22, 2015"

So, what is it about chocolate that could possibly lead to such a benefit? Well, when you strip out the sugar and milk that's added to chocolate, you're left with the cocoa bean. And it's the compounds in the cocoa that researchers are most interested in. The study is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests the bioactive plant compounds found in cocoa beans, called polyphenols, may help protect against heart disease. ""What we're learning is that polyphenols ... seem to improve the health of our blood vessels,"" says Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. As part of the new study, researchers tracked about 20,000 adults in England for some 12 years. Participants filled out food-frequency questionnaires. And the researchers gauged chocolate consumption from these surveys. How much better did the chocolate eaters fare when it came to staving off heart disease? As Howard LeWine of the Harvard Health Blog calculates: ""Among those in the top tier of chocolate consumption, 12 percent developed or died of cardiovascular disease during the study, compared to 17.4 percent of those who didn't eat chocolate."" The reduction in risk is surprising, according to study author Phyo Myint of the University of Aberdeen. As part of the analysis, the chocolate eaters were broken down into groups based on how much they ate   from the heaviest consumers of chocolate to those who ate the least. ""The group with the greatest benefit generally ate 16 to 100 grams per day,"" Myint writes in an email. To put that into perspective, a standard-size Hershey bar has 43 grams. Now, the rub with this kind of study is that the link between chocolate and health is just an association. ""It doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between chocolate and reduced risk of heart disease and stroke,"" says JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Manson and a group of other researchers are about to launch a large-scale clinical trialof the polyphenols   those bioactive compounds   in the cocoa bean. ""We'll be testing them in a capsule form,"" Manson says. ""So, [none of] the sugar, fat and calories"" that you get from a candy bar. Now, if you're like me and don't like the idea of chocolate pill, keep savoring chocolate the old-fashioned way. ""Chocolate can be part of a healthy diet,"" Manson says. But don't overdo it. And stay tuned, Manson says, for the findings of new research intented to unravel this connection between cocoa and our health.","Published: June 22, 2015"

These advances include the addition of pressurized chambers, rheological control, temperature ranges from -196 to 600 C, humidity control and the ability to couple the stage to a wide variety of instruments, such as infrared and Raman microscopes. These features allow the food science microscopist to carry out their micro-experiments under a range of conditions, thereby replicating conditions that may exist in development, production and post-production. Differential scanning calorimetry Starch gelatinization is the process in which the intermolecular bonds within the starch molecule are broken down in the presence of water and heat. The starch grains are irreversibly dissolved. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is one method commonly used to examine the properties of gelatinized starch, and is typically correlated with optical changes within the sample. As the starch grains are heated in the presence of water, DSC measures the endothermic reaction that occurs. Optically, under polarized light, starch grains normally display a Maltese cross (Figure 1). This is because of their crystalline nature. Heat causes the grains to break down into an amorphous form, and the tell-tale cross is lost. Recently, the gelatinization process of starch grains has also been studied using high-pressure techniques, such as high pressure DSCs microscope thermal stages possessing the ability to heat, cool and withstand high pressure. Increasing pressure during the gelatinization process causes an increase in the peak reaction temperature, or the temperature at which the endothermic reaction occurs at a maximum. These experiments can be carried out on a micro-scale, using a polarized light microscope and thermal stage capable of adding pressure. By pressurizing the sample chamber, such instruments can be used to investigate the effects of pressure on the sample during heating and cooling experiments. Rheological cells Using a rheological cell on a microscope stage is useful to study substances, including foods and additives, that have a complex microstructure. Rheology is the study of the flow of matter, primarily in a liquid state, but also as soft solids or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force. The Linkam Optical Shearing System (CSS450), for example, allows structural dynamics of complex fluids to be directly observed via standard optical microscope while they are under precisely controlled temperature and various shear modes. Using an optical shearing cell, it is possible to study the micro-structural evolution of complex fluids in great detail for many physical processes, such as coarsening of binary fluids during their phase separations, flow-induced mixing and demixing of polymer blends, defects dynamics of liquid crystals and aggregation of red blood cells and their deformation in flows. Researchers can then correlate micro-structural dynamics with rheological data to gain insight into rheology of complex fluids. Humidity controls New technology can control humidity within a sealed microscope thermal stage. These new humidity controllers can regulate humidity inside a thermal stage or any other sealed chamber up to a volume of 2000 cc from 5 to 95 percent. No dry air supply is required, and ambient air is dried through a specially designed automatic recycling desiccant system, which can control humidity for months at a time. Rather than simply monitoring the humidity of the air supplied to the chamber, a sensor is placed inside the chamber to create a feedback loop to the controller. Humidity control is imperative in the food and agricultural sciences, as humidity can have a profound effect on how food cooks. Water molecules conduct heat much faster than air, and humid air transfers heat more efficiently to food, cooking it more quickly. It also helps prevent the water in the food from evaporating, keeping the moisture locked inside. Food packaging remains a critical component in the food analysis industry and may include investigation of corrosion and/or leakage in a can or the analysis of a multi-layered film. Polarized light microscopy combined with FTIR microscopy can aid a scientist in analyzing a variety of layers (Figure 2). Plastic packaging often relies on a heat seal to seal its product, and the ability to image these multi-layered plastics while exposing them to a variety of environmental conditions (heating/cooling) has made the thermal stage a critical component in the food analysis laboratory. General improvements Recent advancements in polarized light microscopes have also served to aid the food microscopist. In particular, Nikon s Eclipse polarizing microscopes are known for their ability to produce brighter, clearer and higher-contrast images. The LV100 POL, available in diascopic and episcopic microscope illumination types, offers a reengineered base for even easier operation. Its exclusive, high-intensity halogen light source delivers brighter images, lower power consumption and less heat generation thereby reducing the chance of heat-induced focus drift. The high-intensity 50 W halogen light source incorporates a fly-eye lens design that outputs more light than a 100 W lamp. The greater brightness is achieved by optimizing the lamp filament size. Features such as these allow food microscopists to better resolve their specimens. The reversed-type quadruple nosepiece of Nikon s Eclipse provides more space at the front of the stage, making it easier for a food science microscopist to handle specimen slides. The increased objective lengths and longer working distances provide more space around the nosepiece to exchange specimens or oil the slide. The stage is large-sized, pre-adjusted and click-stops in 45  increments. Studying the microscopic structure of food provides information needed to understand and control its characteristics. On any microscope, the critical factor is the objective. Microscope objectives are perhaps the most important components of an optical microscope because they are responsible for primary image formation and play a central role in determining the quality of images the microscope can produce. Objectives are also instrumental in determining the magnification of a food specimen, and the resolution under which fine specimen detail can be observed in the microscope. Polarized thermal stage microscopy serves to enhance the research of laboratories within the food industry, allowing the food science microscopist to carry out micro-experiments under a range of conditions. These micro-scale experiments allow companies to save time and money in the longrun, troubleshooting issues well before mass production takes place.","Published: June 22, 2015"

Endocytosis is the process by which cells engulf molecules and draw them inside the cell where they perform different functions. This engulfment involves making dimples in the cell membrane that deepen with time and eventually seal off to make a spherical vesicle inside the cell. Essential to the process is the formation of a lattice-like protein shell on the surface of the vesicle membrane. However, there is still no consensus as to the exact function of this coat. Even for the best understood coat protein, clathrin, opinion has split between two different models. In the first model, the clathrin lattice, or coat, first assembles as a flat structure, and then bends, essentially wrapping around the forming vesicle. In the second model, scientists suggest that clathrin assembles directly, assuming the shape of the membrane as it is drawn inwards. Although the second model has been more generally accepted, a new paper published in Science, shows that, in fact, the first explanation is more accurate. In their experiments, the team at EMBL Heidelberg used human cell lines in which the sites where endocytosis was taking place had been tagged with a fluorescent marker. EMBL post-doctoral researcher, Ori Avinoam, then used 3D electron microscopy to take pictures of these sites and analyzed them to understand how they changed shape over time. By analyzing the images computationally, the research team was able to demonstrate that the surface area of the clathrin coat does not change during endocytosis, only its curvature changes as it draws the cell membrane inwards. John Briggs, senior scientist at EMBL Heidelberg, said:  Our results were surprising, because the proteins have to undergo some complicated geometric transformations to go from a flat to a curved shape, which is why the second model was favoured by scientists for such a long time.   The next stage of our research is to investigate more precisely how this rearrangement occurs,  adds Marko Kaksonen, also at EMBL Heidelberg.  We also want to look at other aspects of the process, such as how the molecules ingested by the cells might themselves influence the action of the clathrin proteins. Answering these fundamental questions of cell biology will help scientists better understand the whole process of endocytosis. ","Published: June 20, 2015"

Researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) have developed a method to recreate connections between neurons from two different brain areas in a dish. Their findings were published in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience. Researchers from OIST's Brain Mechanism for Behaviour Unit,Neurobiology Research Unit, and Physics and Biology Unit collaborated on this study. The study used neurons from embryos of mice. The first connections between different brain compartments develop at the embryonic stage. The OIST researchers cultured neurons from the cortex, located at the front of the brain and a structure under it known as the striatum in separate compartments. The OIST researchers had previously shown that culturing cortical and striatal cells within the same compartment resulted in an artificial connectomic system as these cortical and striatal neurons grew connections in all directions in a disorganized manner. Inside a living brain, neurons within the cortex and striatum form dense interconnections with neurons within their respective brain compartments. There is only one-way electrophysiological traffic, from cortical cells to striatal cells via the formers' axons. This one way street had been difficult to recreate in culture because striatal cells tend to die out when they do not receive electrophysiological impulses from cortical cells. The OIST researchers paired cortical and striatal compartments on the surface of multiple multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and kept the cultures alive for three weeks. MEAs are tiny rectangular devices that consist of evenly spaced metal bumps arranged in a grid, all of which serve as electrodes. Each metal bump can transmit the measure of the electrical activity over it. Because many neurons talk to each other simultaneously, mathematical techniques are used to sort the signals from all active electrodes on a MEA, in order to determine which groups are sending and receiving feedback from other groups. After three weeks, enough axons had grown between the cortical and striatal compartments. The MEAs were then hooked up to a system to measure the bursts of electrical activity occurring at the different electrodes. While this system was recording, a knife cut was performed between the cortical and striatal compartments, severing the axons that had grown between them. When this was done, electrical activity was snuffed out almost completely around the electrodes within the striatal compartment. The pattern of electrical activity between electrodes inside the cortical compartment was relatively unaffected, suggesting the interconnectivity between the cortical neurons was unchanged. This demonstrated that there were negligible upstream connections forming between striatal and cortical cells, and a working corticostriatal network had been recreated. ""We can also introduce a third compartment into this setup, possibly more. This would allow connections to grow between multiple types of neurons found in distant parts of the brain,"" said Dr. Marianela Garcia Munoz, Group Leader of the Brain Mechanism for Behaviour Unit.

In a paper published this week in Current Biology, postdoctoral fellow David Kast, PhD, and professor Roberto Dominguez, PhD, and three other colleagues from the Department of Physiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, show for the first time that the formation of ephemeral compartments key in this process require actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex, a composite of seven proteins. They found that the cell recycling machinery is regulated by a protein called WHAMM, and that interfering with this protein or actin polymerization itself severely inhibits the cell's ability to recycle misfolded proteins and damaged organelles via autophagy. This is particularly important for non-dividing neurons, because the accumulation of waste leads to impaired intercellular communication and neurodegeneration. ""Cells are very good at recycling and sorting cellular trash into the correct recycling bins,"" Dominguez says. ""Cells sequester trash in compartments called autophagosomes"" Cells follow a set recipe for recycling: First, the autophagosome is formed around the trash, next autophagosomes are transported and merged with lysosomes -- another cellular compartment -- and finally, the contents are degraded and either secreted or reused by the cell. The Penn team found that this recycling process is fueled by the actin cytoskeleton, whose major component is the protein actin itself. Autophagosomes arise from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -- a network of tubular membranes -- and actin dynamics is key in their formation and movement. The ""fuel"" for the biogenesis and movement of autophagosomes is provided by actin polymerization powered by the Arp2/3 complex, which is recruited to autophagosomes by WHAMM. Polymerization is the chemical reaction that allows for the formation of molecular chains, in this case, actin filaments. In cells, proteins that induce the polymerization of actin, such as the Arp2/3 complex, also control it. When the actin polymerization occurs at one spot on the surface of an autophagosome, which coincides with the location of WHAMM on these organelles, an actin comet tail is formed, and the rapid assembly/disassembly of the actin polymers ""pushes"" the autophagosome toward the lysosome for final processing. The Penn scientists have visualized this phenomenon at high resolution in live cells, revealing the formation of actin ""comet tails"" that propel the formation and movement of autophagosomes from the ER membrane. The constant assembling and disassembling of actin comet tails on the surface of autophagosomes makes them move with speeds of approximately 0.5 micrometers per second. ""Actin acts like rocket fuel to drive this process"" Kast says. ""Actin can function as a track for myosin, or as a motor on its own via this comet tail mechanism."" The team starved cells of amino acids to spur the formation of autophagosomes. But why did they home in on WHAMM as the connector in the first place? ""Kind of by luck,"" says Kast. WHAMM was known to exist in the ER and Golgi apparatus, but we really didn't know what role it played. The Dominguez lab was first interested in WHAMM because of its role in the regulation of the Arp2/3 complex, the only branched-actin nucleating system in cells. On the other hand, autophagy was recently shown to involve actin, but the mechanism was unknown. The Penn scientists connected these observations and hypothesized that possibly WHAMM could link actin assembly to autophagy. They showed that interfering with actin polymerization, knocking down WHAMM, or blocking its interaction with other proteins all inhibit actin ""comet tail"" formation and reduce the size and number of autophagosomes. These results reveal a link between actin-comet tail motility and autophagy. ""Understanding the underlying mechanism for autophagosome formation and maturation will allow us to better understand the differences between the many neurodegenerative diseases that have been linked to defects in autophagy,"" Kast says.

Janssen has the option to extend the collaboration beyond the initial three programs, to include additional organs, disease models or drug programs. Other terms of the agreement are not disclosed.  With Janssen as a preeminent leader in the pharmaceutical industry and Emulate s advanced Organs-on-Chips technology, we aim to transform the R&D paradigm for drug development to better predict how humans will respond to drug candidates.  We expect that this will improve the overall effectiveness of drug development processes and ultimately, lead to increased success rates for the advancement of better and safer drug candidates,  said Hamilton.Organs-on-Chip Technology Emulate is commercializing the Organs-on-Chips technology that is based on pioneering work conducted by Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D. and his team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.  Emulate was launched from the Wyss Institute s technology translation program in July 2014, providing Emulate with a worldwide license to a robust and broad intellectual property portfolio from Harvard University for the Organs-on-Chips technology. Based on our Organs-on-Chips technology, which places living human cells in microengineered environments, Emulate has developed an integrated system that provides a window into the inner-workings of the human body.  Our living products set a new standard for predicting human response, with greater precision and detail than today s cell culture or animal-based testing.  Emulate s Organs-on-Chips contain tiny hollow channels lined by living human cells and tissues cultured under continuous fluid flow and mechanical forces, such as cyclic breathing and peristalsis, which recreate the microenvironment experienced by cells within the human body.  Each Organ-on-Chip can contain tens of thousands of cells and is approximately the size of a USB memory stick.  Organs-on-Chips are miniaturized living systems that represent the smallest functional unit of an organ that effectively recapitulate organ-level physiology and disease responses.  Multiple Organs-on-Chips, such as lung, liver, intestine, kidney, skin, eye, and blood-brain-barrier, can be linked together by flowing human blood or nutrient-containing liquid to create a  Human-Body-on-Chips  that closely replicates whole body-level responses. Emulate, Inc. is a private company that creates living products for understanding how diseases, medicines, chemicals, and foods affect human health.  By setting a new standard for recreating true-to-life human biology, Emulate is advancing product innovation, design and safety across a range of applications in drug development, personalized health, agriculture, cosmetics and chemical-based consumer products.  Emulate continues to develop a wide range of Organs-on-Chips, disease models and diagnostics through collaborations with industry partners and internal programs. By combining our Organs-on-Chips system with individuals  stem cells, Emulate is accelerating progress toward a new era of precision medicine and personalized health. ","Published: June 19, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/carbon-nanoparticles-you-can-make-at-home-189780,Carbon Nanoparticles you can Make at Home Researchers have found an easy way to produce carbon nanoparticles that are small enough to evade the body s immune system  reflect light in the near infrared range for easy detection  and carry payloads of pharmaceutical drugs to targeted tissues    ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Unlike other methods of making carbon nanoparticles   which require expensive equipment and purification processes that can take days   the new approach generates the particles in a few hours and uses only a handful of ingredients, including store-bought molasses.   If you have a microwave and honey or molasses, you can pretty much make these particles at home,  Pan said.  You just mix them together and cook it for a few minutes, and you get something that looks like char, but that is nanoparticles with high luminescence. This is one of the simplest systems that we can think of. It is safe and highly scalable for eventual clinical use.  These  next-generation  carbon spheres have several attractive properties, the researchers found. They naturally scatter light in a manner that makes them easy to differentiate from human tissues, eliminating the need for added dyes or fluorescing molecules to help detect them in the body.  The nanoparticles are coated with polymers that fine-tune their optical properties and their rate of degradation in the body. The polymers can be loaded with drugs that are gradually released. The nanoparticles also can be made quite small, less than eight nanometers in diameter (a human hair is 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers thick).   Our immune system fails to recognize anything under 10 nanometers,  Pan said.  So, these tiny particles are kind of camouflaged, I would say; they are hiding from the human immune system.  The team tested the therapeutic potential of the nanoparticles by loading them with an anti-melanoma drug and mixing them in a topical solution that was applied to pig skin. Bhargava s laboratory used vibrational spectroscopic techniques to identify the molecular structure of the nanoparticles and their cargo.   Raman and infrared spectroscopy are the two tools that one uses to see molecular structure,  Bhargava said.  We think we coated this particle with a specific polymer and with specific drug-loading   but did we really? We use spectroscopy to confirm the formulation as well as visualize the delivery of the particles and drug molecules.  The team found that the nanoparticles did not release the drug payload at room temperature, but at body temperature began to release the anti-cancer drug. The researchers also determined which topical applications penetrated the skin to a desired depth. In further experiments, the researchers found they could alter the infusion of the particles into melanoma cells by adjusting the polymer coatings. Imaging confirmed that the infused cells began to swell, a sign of impending cell death.   This is a versatile platform to carry a multitude of drugs   for melanoma, for other kinds of cancers and for other diseases,  Bhargava said.  You can coat it with different polymers to give it a different optical response. You can load it with two drugs, or three, or four, so you can do multidrug therapy with the same particles.   By using defined surface chemistry, we can change the properties of these particles,  Pan said.  We can make them glow at a certain wavelength and also we can tune them to release the drugs in the presence of the cellular environment. That is, I think, the beauty of the work.

Kertesz expects that time to be cut to four to five minutes soon. For this proof-of-concept demonstration, researchers rapidly profiled two hormones from human pituitary tissue.  Instead of having to cut and mount tissue and wait for a trained pathologist to review the sample under a microscope, a technician might soon perform an equally conclusive test in the operating environment,  Kertesz said. The new mass spectrometry-based technology provides an attractive alternative to the traditional method called immunohistochemistry, or IHC, which looks for specific protein biomarkers to make a diagnosis. Although the IHC approach provides a high degree of spatial recognition, it is time consuming and limited by the quality and specificity of the antibody used to detect the protein. ORNL researchers trace this success to patents resulting from previously funded DOE projects and noted that this work advances the liquid microjunction surface sampling probe technology first patented by ORNL. Additionally, ORNL houses the only laboratories in the world that have this automated droplet-based surface sampling probe and the requisite software. While yet other mass spectrometry-based techniques such as desorption electrospray ionization and rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry are being evaluated for classifying tumors and providing prognostic information, they are limited mainly to the analysis of lower molecular weight biomolecules. These include metabolites, fatty acids and lipids. The new droplet-based method developed at ORNL does not share this limitation.  The ability to quickly characterize the tissue distribution of larger macromolecular biomarkers like peptides and proteins would harness the diagnostic value of validated immunohistochemistry approaches for surgical decision-making,  Kertesz said. Kertesz noted that this system has been successfully used for spatially resolved sampling and detection of drugs and metabolites from thin sections of animal tissue and proteins from dried blood.  On the basis of the results and the relative simplicity, rapidity and specificity of our method, there is great potential for our technology to assist surgeons in the detection of cancer from tissue biopsy samples,  said Kertesz, a member of ORNL s Organic and Biological Mass Spectrometry Group and lead author of the paper.","Published: June 19, 2015"

The proprietary technology will be incorporated by Agalimmune into its novel cancer immunotherapy molecules. Under the terms of the agreement, KODE may receive up to $31 million USD ( 21 million GBP) in development and sales milestones, plus royalties on net sales. Agalimmune has exclusive rights to the use of the technology in the field of intratumoral injection for cancer treatment, and specifically relating to the clinical candidate molecule AGI-134. KODE  Technology has been extensively validated by Agalimmune prior to in-licensing, and has been shown to be effective for treatment of both primary and secondary tumours in animal models. Agalimmune injects synthetic animal-antigen mimetics, which incorporate the FSL constructs, into primary tumours. As the immune system naturally rejects animal tissue, it attacks the modified tumour. In this process of destroying the tumour, the body s immune system is educated to recognize the patient s own (autologous) tumour antigens and so destroy unmodified primary and secondary tumours: http://www.agalimmune.com/index.php/movie. KODE  constructs have been engineered to be easily dispersed in biocompatible media, spontaneously incorporate into cell membranes, and have low toxicity. Graham Griffiths, Director of Agalimmune, commented:  We believe that this technology has great value in immunotherapy, and we are very pleased to be collaborating with a world-leader in the development of synthetic glycolipids. This licensing agreement also represents a significant step forward in Agalimmune s progress towards the development of pioneering targeted cancer vaccines and immunotherapies for the benefit of patients.

However, the basis for such effects, associated with either primary or metastatic tumors, are generally poorly understood. New findings from a research group at Uppsala University show that the neutrophil, a type of blood cell, plays an important role in this process. The main function of neutrophils is to protect us from infections, but the presence of a tumor in the body can trick these immune cells to fight an infection that does not exist. This is caused by substances secreted by the tumor that activates neutrophils to form  NETs  (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps). These NETs are formed in a spectacular way when neutrophils externalizes their DNA and together with platelets forms a meshwork that can trap bacteria   an immune reaction that can be crucial during sepsis. In a newly published article, researchers at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology show that NETs accumulate in the peripheral circulation in mice with cancer and causes decreased functionality of blood vessels and inflammation in organs not affected by the actual tumor or metastatic tumor cells.  Since NETs have a high content of extracellular DNA, they can be dissolved by DNase treatment. DNase treatment restored the vascular function in the kidney or heart to levels seen in non-tumor-bearing mice, and also suppressed the inflammatory response.   Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that NETs mediate the negative collateral effects of tumors on distal organs, but that this condition is reversible. We believe that these findings may add new knowledge to how cancer patients should be treated to avoid organ failure , says Anna-Karin Olsson, senior lecturer at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University.","Published: June 19, 2015"

The new laboratory, opening June 29, 2015 will incorporate best-in-class infrastructure and equipment to meet the current and future demands of its bio/pharmaceutical clients. This multi-million Euro investment will serve the attractive French market, support biologics development, and will operate under Good Manufacturing Practice. The 2,100 square meter facility, strategically located near the main logistics hubs, has been designed and built specifically for the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, targeting the reduction of sample processing times through increased operational efficiency. All services currently available in Clichy will be transferred to Villeneuve La Garenne, with a special emphasis on safety equipment (fume hoods) to effectively treat organic products and classified carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic (CMR) substances. At the new site, SGS will introduce services to address the growing biopharmaceutical pipeline with capabilities for mycoplasma tests and amino acid analysis. The contamination of cell cultures by mycoplasma is a major risk for the biopharmaceutical industry. By their diversity, their small size and lack of bacterial wall, these microorganisms are not detectable visually, are very difficult to remove and can compromise the quality of biologic medicines. To meet the needs of its customers, SGS has created a new Mycoplasma detection department. ""By recruiting an expert project manager, Ms. Aude Sanchez, Engineer in Biotechnologies (ENSTBB) and in close collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific, a global leading supplier in this field, SGS has the means to provide innovative solutions, performance, and reliability to its customers"", said Paul Beyou, Laboratory Director for Life Science Services Villeneuve La Garenne.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/crumpled-filter-to-slash-energy-consumption-191598, Crumpled  Filter to Slash Energy Consumption Scientists have developed an ultra thin  super strong membrane to filter liquids and gases  with the potential to cut energy consumption in industry  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Membranes are selectively permeable barriers that can provide a filter for a range of processes, from removing salt from sea water in desalination plants, to filtering the blood of kidney patients in dialysis machines. Filtration processes using membranes could potentially reduce energy consumption compared to other separation methods.  However, many industries use evaporation and distillation techniques rather than membranes, because membranes can be costly to scale up and they are not resistant to the organic solvents used in many industrial refining and chemical processes.  Now, researchers from Imperial College London have developed a prototype crumpled membrane that has the potential to be used widely across industry. The prototype is extremely thin - it would take a stack of ten thousand membranes to match the diameter of a human hair - making it very permeable. It is also strong, and is able to filter organic liquids at pressures of around 50 bar, which is the equivalent to the pressure at around 500 metres below the ocean's surface. The membrane is durable and resistant in a range of organic solvents. In a study detailed in the journal Science, the team created a membrane with nanoscale crumples and established that this provides an increased surface area for filtering substances that remains strong and does not buckle, even under extreme pressures. The prototype is 80 millimetres in diameter, but the team is confident that it can be scaled up to industrial areas. Ultimately, the researchers believe that their prototype membrane could be used to improve or completely replace industrial processes that process organic solvents, which currently rely on evaporation and distillation techniques. Approximately 30 per cent of the world's energy is currently used by industry, with a substantial fraction of that being used in evaporation and distillation processes. These industries could potentially make major energy savings if they used the membranes, with consequent reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Professor Andrew Livingston, co-author of the study from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London, said: ""Membranes are currently used for a range of important tasks such as making water drinkable and life-saving kidney filtering. The drawback has been that industry hasn't been able to use membranes in organic liquid systems more widely because they've had cost and design limitations. Our research suggests that we can overcome these challenges, which could make these membranes useful for industries ranging from pharmaceutical companies to oil refining. The energy and environmental benefits could be massive."" Dr Santanu Karan, co-author also from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London, added: ""I am really excited about this research breakthrough. We now want to work even more closely with industry to further refine our membranes so that they can meet their needs. We hope our work will lead to new collaborations and ultimately, improvements in the way industries use separation processes."" To test the effectiveness of the membrane in the lab, they team mixed together a solution containing a solvent, alcohol, and dyed molecules of different colours and sizes. They then made the solution percolate through the membrane at high pressures, using a device called a dead-end cell, to see if they could filter out everything apart from the alcohol. The team observed the process using an absorption spectroscopy device, which uses light at different wavelengths to determine what molecules are passing through the membrane. They determined that the membrane was completely effective, with only the alcohol passing through. The researchers then compared the crumpled membrane to a conventional membrane, carrying out the same experiment. Their aim was to determine how fast their membrane could purify and concentrate the solution compared to the conventional model. They found that the crumpled membrane could separate substances 400 times faster than the conventional membrane. The team is now planning to further develop and optimise the membrane technology so that it can be scaled up for use in industries such as pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and oil refining. The research was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the BP International Centre for Advanced Materials.","Published: June 19, 2015"

The collaboration brings together two well-respected organizations and aligns complementary strengths to address the need for real-world evidence, one of the faster-growing aspects of clinical research. It combines PPD s clinical trial design, health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), medical affairs research and epidemiology services with HealthCore s strengths in HEOR, innovative real-world research designs and its robust research-enabled electronic health care data environment.  The goals of optimizing reimbursement and increasing payer and patient value are becoming more dependent on biopharmaceutical companies  ability to provide high-quality evidence of how products will perform for patients in a real-world setting,  said Michael Pollock, vice president of real-world outcomes at PPD.  With the collaborative expertise of PPD and HealthCore, particularly in planning, designing and implementing pragmatic clinical trials, we hope to set a new standard for the quality, cost and speed of real-world evidence generation that can help optimize patient outcomes and enable our clients to better demonstrate the true value of their products and the return on their investments in new product development.  The collaboration allows life sciences companies to engage in one contract with combined services from PPD and HealthCore that has the potential to cover product research in both pre- and post- approval settings. Both PPD and HealthCore will be able to provide biopharmaceutical companies analyses of medical claims data and electronic health records necessary to understand the utilization and impact of their products and to design appropriate pragmatic clinical trials that address payers  needs.  By combining clinical and economic information and leveraging our access to large health care provider networks, we will have a much more robust view of how patients use and react to different therapies,  said Marcus Wilson, president of HealthCore.  This gives us an opportunity to produce relevant information that can facilitate decisions and speed to market those products that provide the most value to patients, payers and life sciences companies alike.  The majority of post-approval pharmaceutical research includes HEOR, as life sciences companies seek to generate real-world outcomes as part of their cost-effectiveness analyses. Payers are requesting more real-world evidence to help them analyze product safety and effectiveness. As a result, companies are undertaking more pragmatic clinical trials and other Phase IV studies to meet the payer need for real-world outcomes data and to support appropriate reimbursement.  There s a certain level of efficiency and understanding that the two companies will gain from working together on research designs at an earlier point in the development process,  said Mark Cziraky, vice president of research for HealthCore.  This approach allows us to evolve the evidence while operationally offering seamless, one-stop research shopping to life sciences companies. ","Published: June 19, 2015"

The study investigators hope to better understand the long-term health consequences of EVD, determine if survivors develop immunity that will protect them from future Ebola infection, and assess whether previously EVD-infected individuals can transmit infection to close contacts and sexual partners. The study, sponsored by the Ministry of Health of Liberia and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, will take place at various sites in Liberia and is expected to enroll approximately 7,500 people, including 1,500 people of any age who survived EVD and 6,000 of their close contacts.  The clinical course of Ebola virus disease is reasonably well-understood, but we still have much to learn about the long-term health effects of the illness in those who recover,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  To unravel the many unknowns, we have expanded the focus of our partnership with Liberia s Ministry of Health to include research on the long-term health effects of Ebola virus disease, in addition to our ongoing efforts to find an effective preventive vaccine and treatments for Ebola virus disease.  Mosaka Fallah, Ph.D., M.P.H., former Ebola emergency-response program manager for Action Against Hunger Liberia; Michael C. Sneller, M.D., from NIAID s Laboratory of Immunoregulation; and Desmond Williams, M.D., Ph.D., from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will serve as principal investigators for the study. Investigators from NIH s National Eye Institute, the Johns Hopkins University Wilmer Eye Institute, Baltimore; the Ministry of Health of Liberia and the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Sinkor, Monrovia, will also collaborate on the research. Enrollment began at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center, and the study will open at the following sites later in June: C.H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Duport Road Clinic in Paynesville, and Redemption Hospital in Monrovia. Additional sites in Liberia are expected to join the study in the future. Participants who test positive for HIV infection during the course of the study will be counseled and referred to treatment in accordance with standard medical practice in Liberia. Study participants will undergo a medical history and physical and vision examination and have blood samples collected so researchers can identify and track any health issues, monitor organ and ocular function and record Ebola antibody levels. Some participants may also be asked to provide samples of bodily fluids, such as sweat, tears, and for adults, semen or cervical secretions. Participants will be asked if they would like to identify up to five close contacts (household members at the time of Ebola diagnosis and sexual partners after recovery from Ebola virus disease). Close contacts who agree to participate in the study will undergo a physical examination, have blood samples taken, and asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their contact with the Ebola survivor, such as touching, sleeping in the same bed and sexual intercourse. Staff from the NIH s National Eye Institute have helped establish a new eye clinic at John F. Kennedy Medical Hospital, where ophthalmologists from NEI and Johns Hopkins will be evaluating study participants and their identified close contacts for visual problems. Treatment will be provided by Liberian ophthalmologists partnering in the study.  There have been reports of inflammatory eye disease and vision loss among Ebola survivors,  said NEI Clinical Director Frederick Ferris, M.D.  Our goal is to determine the incidence and extent of Ebola-related eye disease among survivors, risk factors contributing to its development, and optimal treatment strategies.  The research team will follow the Ebola survivors and their close contacts for up to five years with study visits occurring every six months. At each follow-up visit, participants will undergo a physical examination and additional blood draws, to allow study physicians to monitor and characterize any changes in Ebola antibody levels and to detect the presence of select medical conditions. This information will help scientists determine the evolution of Ebola antibodies and will provide insight on whether survivors can still transmit the virus and if so, whether these people get sick with Ebola virus disease. Using data collected at these site visits, the researchers will calculate the incidence, prevalence and risk factors for various health issues experienced by survivors, such as vision problems; immune system changes; mental disorders; joint pain; diabetes; hypertension; and pregnancy complications. Close contacts will be used as a control group to assess whether the risks of these conditions are the same or different from those who have not had Ebola virus disease.

The device was designed to imitate, on a micro-level, the structure and function of the placenta and model the transfer of nutrients from mother to fetus. This prototype is one of the latest in a series of organ-on-a-chip technologies developed to accelerate biomedical advances. The study, published online in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine, was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from the NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the University of Pennsylvania, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Seoul National University and Asan Medical Center in South Korea. ""We believe that this technology may be used to address questions that are difficult to answer with current placenta model systems and help enable research on pregnancy and its complications,"" said Roberto Romero, M.D., chief of the NICHD's Perinatology Research Branch and one of the study authors. The placenta is a temporary organ that develops in pregnancy and is the major interface between mother and fetus. Among its many functions is to serve as a ""crossing guard"" for substances traveling between mother and fetus. The placenta helps nutrients and oxygen move to the fetus and helps waste products move away. At the same time, the placenta tries to stop harmful environmental exposures, like bacteria, viruses and certain medications, from reaching the fetus. When the placenta doesn't function correctly, the health of both mom and baby suffers. Researchers are trying to learn how the placenta manages all this traffic, transporting some substances and blocking others. This knowledge may one day help clinicians better assess placental health and ultimately improve pregnancy outcomes. However, studying the placenta in humans is challenging: it is time-consuming, subject to a great deal of variability and potentially risky for the fetus. For those reasons, previous studies on placental transport have relied largely on animal models and on laboratory-grown human cells. These methods have yielded helpful information, but are limited as to how well they can mimic physiological processes in humans. The researchers created the placenta-on-a-chip technology to address these challenges, using human cells in a structure that more closely resembles the placenta's maternal-fetal barrier. The device consists of a semi-permeable membrane between two tiny chambers, one filled with maternal cells derived from a delivered placenta and the other filled with fetal cells derived from an umbilical cord. After designing the structure of the model, the researchers tested its function by evaluating the transfer of glucose (a substance made by the body when converting carbohydrates to energy) from the maternal compartment to the fetal compartment. The successful transfer of glucose in the device mirrored what occurs in the body. ""The chip may allow us to do experiments more efficiently and at a lower cost than animal studies,"" said Dr. Romero. ""With further improvements, we hope this technology may lead to better understanding of normal placental processes and placental disorders.""","Published: June 19, 2015"

By uniting expertise, this focused cash injection will bridge the gap between academic research and the pharmaceutical industry in the search for new drugs to slow the development of Alzheimer s.  Dr Diego Gomez-Nicola and colleagues at the University of Southampton will build on their current finding that a protein in the immune system called CSF1R could be the key to an effective new drug for the disease. Together with drug discovery experts at MRC Technology, they will seek to develop novel therapeutics to target the immune system   a double edged sword in the brain s response to nerve cell death. Researchers now believe that Alzheimer s disturbs the brain s inflammatory response, causing the damage associated with the disease. CSF1R is a key player in regulating the brain s immune response. In their previous studies in mice, the team found that blocking CSF1R can dampen the inflammatory response to nerve cell death and improve symptoms in other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the compounds currently available to block CSF1R are not ideal to take into the clinic, due to unwanted effects and difficulties getting into the brain. This investment will allow the researchers to explore other, more targeted approaches to block CSF1R   important groundwork before any new treatment can go into testing in people. Dr Gomez Nicola, Career Track Lecturer and MRC NIRG fellow at the University of Southampton, said:  Inflammation is the body s response to damage and something we ve all experienced but sometimes these mechanisms to defend the body go awry. In Alzheimer s disease, specialised immune cells called microglia are a little too eager to clear damage. Their ranks swell and activity increases, with damaging consequences for surrounding nerve cells.  This project will allow us to find the best way to interfere with the biological cascade that leads to an increase in microglia numbers. We know that targeting CSF1R is being explored as a potential treatment for cancer and inflammatory conditions, and we hope that by fine-tuning compounds to act specifically in the brain, this approach could be tested for benefits in Alzheimer s too. This crucial drug discovery work in cells and mice should act as stepping stone to develop new treatments that can halt damaging brain inflammation and nerve cell death.  Dr Eric Karran, Director of Research at Alzheimer s Research UK, said:  It s been fascinating to see the academic community dissect the role of inflammation in Alzheimer s disease and learn more about the  friendly fire  that takes place during the course of the disease. But now we need to translate this interesting biology into tangible benefits for the 500,000 people in this country living with Alzheimer s. It s a long road from research in the laboratory to treatments in the clinic, but investment to boost the number of new drug targets is critical if we are to face this huge medical challenge.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director of Drug Discovery at MRC Technology added:  Our Centre for Therapeutics Discovery has proven capability in drug discovery and as a charity we are ideally placed between academia and pharma to translate promising science into effective treatments for patients.  Dr Andy Takle, Senior Director, Open Innovation, UK, Eisai Ltd., said:  Neuroinflammation is emerging as a key contributing factor in driving Alzheimer s disease pathology. The biological mechanisms that underpin this process are incredibly complex and our understanding relies heavily on information originating from the academic community. For this reason we recognise that collaboration is key in identifying new opportunities to intervene. As a Dementia Consortium partner on this exciting project we look forward to bridging academic expertise with a focused drug discovery effort to develop new medicines for this devastating disease.  Michael Hutton, Chief Scientific Officer, Neurodegeneration, Eli Lilly and Company, said:   Lilly is delighted to support this exciting program as part of the Dementia Consortium, which offers a new model for public-private partnership to support drug development in Alzheimer s disease.

Addiction is a life-long affliction manifested by episodes of relapse, despite prolonged abstinence,  says Amy Gancarz, PhD, lead author of the study, which was published this month in an Advance Online Publication in Nature Neuroscience.  There is a need to more fully understand the long-term molecular changes in the brain involved in drug craving and relapse.  Gancarz, a former postdoctoral associate with the UB Research Institute on Addictions (RIA), worked on the study under the direction of senior author David Dietz, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in UB s School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Dietz is also a faculty member in UB s Neuroscience Program and an affiliated scientist with RIA. The study found that by manipulating the activity of Activin receptors   receptors found in the brain   the researchers were able to increase or decrease cocaine-taking and relapse behavior in animal models. The study focused, specifically, on Activin receptors in regions of the brain that are involved in pleasure and reward.  There are changes in the brain caused by drug use that occur and persist, but are only unmasked after withdrawal from a drug   in this case, cocaine,  Dietz says.  Cocaine use alters the connections between certain neurons through changes in the shape of the cells.  The researchers discovered that the Activin pathway controls the ability of cocaine to induce this change in the neurons and determined that the Activin receptor may control this response to cocaine by regulating the expression of a number of genes.  Understanding this critical pathway will help us pursue new directions in potential pharmacological and gene therapies to prevent drug relapses,  Dietz says.  If we can control this pathway, we may be able to help prevent relapses in people who have been abstinent from cocaine.  University at Buffalo   Original reporting by: Cathy Wilde Dietz DM et al.

While humans may lack the scent-tracking sophistication of, say, a search-and-rescue dog, we can sniff our way, blindfolded, toward a location whose scent we ve smelled only once before, according to the UC Berkeley study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Similar investigations have been conducted on birds and rodents, but this is the first time smell-based navigation has been field-tested on humans. The results evoke a GPS-like superpower one could call an  olfactory positioning system.   What we ve found is that humans have the capability to orient ourselves along highways of odors and crisscross landscapes using only our sense of smell,  said study lead author Lucia Jacobs, a UC Berkeley psychology professor who studies evolution and cognition in animals and humans. Smell is a primitive sense that our early ancestors used for foraging, hunting and mating, among other skills necessary for survival. Early sailors and aviators gave anecdotal reports of using odors to navigate, but there have been no experiential scientific studies on this until now. The process of smelling, or olfaction, is triggered by odor molecules traveling up the nasal passage, where they are identified by receptors that send signals to the olfactory bulb   which sits between the nasal cavity and the brain s frontal lobe   and processes the information. A key to the connection between smell, memory and navigation is that olfactory bulbs have a strong neural link to the brain s hippocampus, which creates spatial maps of our environment.  Olfaction is like this background fabric to our world that we might not be conscious of, but we are using it to stay oriented,  Jacobs said.  We may not see a eucalyptus grove as we pass it at night, but our brain is encoding the smells and creating a map.  Pigeons and rats, for example, are known to orient themselves using odor maps, or  smellscapes,  but sighted humans rely more heavily on visual landmarks, and so the study turned up some surprising results. Two dozen young adults were tested on orientation and navigation tasks under various scenarios in which their hearing, sight or smell was blocked. The test location was a 25-by-20-foot room where 32 containers with sponges were placed at points around the edge of the room. Two of the sponges were infused with essential oils such as sweet birch, anise or clove. In the smell-only experiment, study participants were led, one at a time, into the room wearing blindfolds, earplugs and headphones and walked in circles for disorientation purposes. They spent a minute at a specific point on the grid, where they inhaled a combination of two fragrances. After being walked in circles again for disorientation purposes, they were tasked with sniffing their way back to the starting point where they had smelled the two fragrances. Overall, study participants navigated relatively closely to the targeted location when using only their sense of smell, compared to when other sensory inputs were blocked. Moreover, they were not just following one scent, but using information from both scents to orient themselves toward a point on an odor grid.  We never thought humans could have a good enough sense of smell for this,  said Jacobs. But in retrospect, she noted, the results are  as obvious as the nose on my face.  Jacobs will be exploring this mechanism further as a scientist selected to be on the team of the National Science Foundation s  Cracking the Olfactory Code  Ideas Lab, which takes place this summer.

When learning to drive, it is often very difficult to distinguish between important and irrelevant information. How the brain learns the importance of certain images over others is being investigated by Prof. Sonja Hofer at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. In a recently published study in Neuron, the neuroscientist and her team show that learning the relevance of images considerably modifies neuronal networks in the brain. These changes might help our brain to process and classify the overload of stimuli in our environment more effectively. How we perceive our environment greatly depends on what we have previously seen and learned. For example, expert drivers do not need to think twice about the meaning of different road signs and are experienced in assessing traffic situations. They can filter out relevant information from a flood of other irrelevant stimuli and thus react quickly. In contrast, beginners need much longer to process the new information. Hofer s team at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel and University College London addressed the question of how processing of sensory stimuli is optimized in the brain through learning. To do this, Prof. Hofer s team investigated the visual cortex of mice. This part of the brain is responsible for the processing and perception of visual stimuli. Mice ran through a virtual-reality environment where they encountered various images, one of which was paired with a reward. Within one week, the animals had learnt to discriminate between the images and to respond accordingly. This learning was reflected in the activity of nerve cells in the visual cortex whose responses were recorded and tracked over the course of learning. While the responses in the brain to the relevant visual stimuli were quite unspecific in beginner mice, many more neurons reacted specifically to the shown images after one week of training.  From day to day, the response of the neurons to the images became increasingly distinguishable and reliable , says Adil Khan, one of the two first authors. He speculates that such changes in the brain might also allow us to process important information from our environment more efficiently, and perhaps underlies our ability to react promptly to important visual stimuli. The scientists also demonstrated that diverse internal and external signals affect the processing of the visual stimuli.  We observed that the response of the nerve cells to the same visual stimuli became less accurate when the mice where engaged in another task, such as having to discriminate between different smells. The visual stimuli then lose their relevance and are no longer so effectively analyzed by the brain , says Khan.  Remarkably, the expectation of a stimulus even before it appears, and the anticipation of a reward also altered the activity of specific brain cells. This means that from one moment to the next our brain might process the same stimulus quite differently depending on its importance and relevance.  Traditionally it was thought that the visual cortex exclusively processes visual information. This study, however, corroborates that during learning also many other signals from various brain regions influence activity in this brain area.  This means that our previously learnt knowledge, our expectations and the context we are in can have a great impact on our visual perception of the environment , explains Hofer.

Like other multicellular creatures, plants must coordinate activity among many different types of cells and tissues. Messages, demands, warnings and alerts shuttle among cells near and far. These messages determine what jobs cells take on and how they work together to build and maintain tissues and organs. As plants grow, they also use this information to decide where new structures like leaves or roots should go. Torii, lead author Jin Suk Lee and their colleagues focused on how plants decide where to place stomata: tiny, two-cell openings on the surface that connect the plant s interior with the outside world. Critical for water and gas exchange, stomata develop on the plant s surface based largely on signals they receive from neighboring cells.  Stomata are so important for plant productivity,  said Torii, who is also an investigator with Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.  They re small but have a big impact.  Plants must grow and distribute their stomata evenly on the surface because too many or too few can disrupt water balance or photosynthesis. Lee and Torii studied two signals that plant cells release to control where stomata go. These signals are actually proteins, or small molecules that help cells do work and communicate with one another. One is called Stomagen, which promotes stomata development. The other protein messenger   known by its acronym EPF2   opposes Stomagen by preventing stomata formation.  My lab had previously identified many key factors that control stomata development and enforce proper stomata patterning,  said Torii.  We had described EPF2 and another group identified Stomagen. But we did not know how plant cells balanced these two signals.  Her team wanted to understand how cells near the plant s surface recognize Stomagen and EPF2 and how they decide which signal to obey. They studied these questions in a small mustard weed called Arabidopsis thaliana, which researchers including Torii have long studied to understand how plant cells organize themselves into a functional body. The researchers studied how messages from Stomagen and EPF2 are transmitted in mutantArabidopsis plants that lacked certain cell surface proteins. Like a person standing in the doorway of a house, these surface proteins have one foot planted outside and the other inside and are important conduits for conveying information and messages into the cell. They discovered that Stomagen and EPF2 actually compete for access to the same surface proteins that can transmit either a stomata-promoting or stomata-repressing message into the cell based on which signal molecule binds to them. If Stomagen attaches, then the cell receives a message to create a stomata. If EPF2 attaches instead, the surface proteins tell the cell to shut down stomata development.  The cell has these competing signals that it has to interpret, and it uses the same surface protein for both,  said Torii. This type of signal delivery system   where two opposing messages compete directly for access to the same proteins   exists in animals. But this type of antagonistic signaling has never been seen in plants, she added. This is a particularly surprising finding because Stomagen and EPF2 look very similar to one another. They differ in only a few key qualities. Yet those small differences amount to big differences in the messages they deliver to cells. The discovery sheds light on the mechanisms that cells employ to detect and process messages   including conflicting signals   from the outside world. In the future, Torii would like to understand how the pro-stomata and anti-stomata messages act once they re inside plant cells.  This paper is just the beginning,  she said.","Published: June 18, 2015"

This impairment is caused by the production of excessive amounts of collagen in those with SSc, which can damage blood vessels. Valentina Hartwig at the Italian National Research Council s Institute of Clinical Physiology in Pisa wanted to find a non-invasive method for determining how this damage affects the blood supply to specific regions of the body. So she decided to turn to NIR spectroscopy, an analytical technique that detects specific molecules based on their absorption and reflection of light at NIR wavelengths. NIR spectroscopy can be used to monitor blood supply and circulation by measuring the concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin in biological tissue, but conventional NIR spectroscopy can only measure these concentrations at specific points in the body. To measure the concentrations over a larger area, Hartwig took advantage of a novel NIR spectroscopic camera that irradiates samples with infrared light produced by an array of 470 light-emitting diodes.  The recent development of NIR spectroscopic 2D imaging offers the possibility of visualising oxygenated haemoglobin distribution in large tissue areas,  explains Hartwig.  In the past, we have used this camera in experimental cardiology to map cardiac muscle tissue oxygenation during open-chest coronary by-pass surgery.  Together with colleagues from the Institute of Clinical Physiology and the University of Florence, Hartwig used this camera to monitor blood supply in the hand of an SSc patient and a healthy control. The camera produced coloured images of the hands, with blue indicating low levels of oxygenated haemoglobin and red indicating high levels. After first monitoring the blood supply to the hands at normal, resting conditions, Hartwig and her colleagues investigated what happened when they temporarily restricted the supply of blood with a blood pressure monitor, taking an image with the camera every 10 seconds. Even at resting conditions, Hartwig and her team found that the blood supply was lower in the hand of the SSc patient and also varied more across the hand. After restricting the blood supply to the hands for three minutes, Hartwig and her team found that it quickly returned to its resting state in the healthy control. The blood supply took much longer to return to its resting state in the hand of the SSc patient, with certain parts of the hand, such as the ring finger, returning to the resting state much later than others. Although this study only involved two subjects, it provides an initial indication that NIR spectroscopic 2D imaging can be used to monitor the supply of blood to specific areas of the body in SSc patients. More evidence is expected to come from a larger clinical study that will begin shortly, says Hartwig.  The camera has the potential to be employed in the clinical practice to evaluate microcirculatory impairment in systemic sclerosis,  she concludes.  We can hypothesise using the camera to assess dynamic changes after vasoactive drugs, to assess the effectiveness of treatments and to identify responses to specific therapies.

Coordinated by the University of Leeds, the other project partners include the University of Heidelberg, Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), NHS England, University College Cork, Semmelweis University in Budapest, and the University of Copenhagen. Aridhia will provide the technological framework   a private analytical workspace   enabling the partners to interrogate the project data. The raw data will be gathered across the partner countries and analysed in Aridhia s data science platform, AnalytiXagility. Aridhia will also create a bespoke dashboard for insurers and healthcare providers, and an app which allows patients to provide feedback on their care.  AnalytiXagility s Software as a Service (SaaS) analytical workspaces mark a change in how healthcare analytics services are procured. It was awarded a place on the UK Government s G-Cloud framework earlier this year, making it available to healthcare providers on a monthly subscription basis. This means they do not need to commit to costly on-premise infrastructure or become locked into long-term contracts. Since the launch of AnalytiXagility last year, Aridhia has used its analytics capabilities to support integrated care for diseases including renal cancer, and has enabled research projects on a range of health issues including diabetes, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Chris Roche, CEO at Aridhia, commented:  We are honoured to have been successful in our bid for Horizon 2020 project funding and, even more so, to be collaborating with such a strong group of partners over the next four years to develop an evidence-based, preventative oral healthcare model.  The SaaS model we operate with our platform offers a key advantage to the partnership in that there is no need to create the complex data analytics infrastructure from scratch; meaning time and funding can be spent wholly on valuable research into oral care.  At Aridhia, a multidisciplinary team will work on the project, which begins next month, drawn from across its engineering, software development, data science and information governance teams. Aridhia s bid was supported by the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) Scotland, which helps to connect businesses with European partners and understand the various EU funding opportunities available. It is part of Scottish Enterprise and has close connections with network partners and expert advisers across Europe. The EEN Scotland worked with Aridhia to put together a partnering profile. It promoted it through the network and connected the company with European projects through its data and participation in four targeted Horizon 2020 Matchmaking events. The connections during these meetings have helped Aridhia to find partners for a number of Horizon 2020 consortium-based projects. Camille Moran of the EEN Scotland said:  Aridhia is a company that really understands how SMEs can benefit from European funding. They have worked closely with the EEN Scotland since 2013, first profiling their offer, and then to identify appropriate projects and partners. The team have put in the necessary time to go out to Horizon2020 information days, partnering events and expressing interest to opportunities advertised on the EEN Partnering Database, which has resulted in their continued success with European projects.  Horizon 2020 is the biggest ever EU research and innovation programme, making nearly  80 billion of funding available between 2014 and 2020. It promises to take great ideas from the laboratory to market, and places emphasis on the economic impact of the research and innovation it supports. The programme is the latest of the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development and follows FP7, which invested a budget of  50 billion between 2007 and 2013.","Published: June 18, 2015"

Together with lead author Patrice Rassam and key collaborators Mark Sansom at Oxford and Jacob Piehler at the University of Osnabr ck. Gram-negative bacteria are a major cause of disease, in part because they have a robust outer membrane that protects against the immune system and certain antibiotics. They can live in a broad range of environments, which for E.coli includes river water as well as humans and animals. The bacteria have intricate regulatory mechanisms for ensuring they have the right complement of outer membrane proteins   known as OMPs   for a particular habitat. But little is known about how OMPs are replaced in the outer membrane when large scale remodelling of these proteins has to occur on adapting to changes in growth conditions. The new research describes how bacteria are able to change the proteins in their outer membrane and how this is intimately linked to the process of protein insertion in the membrane. It was an initial focus on colicins   toxins produced by some strains of E.coli   which led Kleanthous and Baumann to their current finding. The researchers were tracking how colicins make their way into bacteria via specific OMP receptors and had developed fluorescent versions of colicins to do this. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, they noticed that the colicin-bound receptors behaved in an unusual way in the membrane. 'We spent many years trying to figure out what might be causing the receptors to behave in this way, as if something was boxing them in,' said Professor Kleanthous. They felt that an understanding of this would help unravel a basic property of the outer membrane, a key component of pathogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria. After discounting many potential mechanisms, they discovered that the receptors bunch together in the outer membrane into structures they call 'OMP islands'. It was this that was causing the 'boxing in' they had noticed originally. They estimate that there are hundreds of OMPs in these islands and up to 40 OMP islands in a typical cell. The scientists could replicate the apparently complex behaviour of OMPs in Gram-negative bacteria using purified proteins in an artificial membrane system in which they found that OMPs have a natural tendency to self-associate. The next step was to find out where the machinery that inserts OMPs within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is located. 'We were not surprised to find the OMP insertion machinery in the islands,' explains Dr Baumann. 'But it was completely unexpected to discover this machinery shuts down as the outer membrane matures.' Although the reason for this is unclear, it is an important part of the new mechanism as it means 'old' and 'new' OMPs do not intermix. When the group explored this further, they found that OMP biogenesis occurs as a gradient that is highest in the central regions of the cell and diminishes towards the ends of the cell. The cumulative effect is that old OMPs are pushed to the ends of growing cells as new OMPs take their place. This results in what the researchers call 'binary OMP partitioning': after two cell divisions, cells appear that do not have any of the original OMPs. In simple terms, a bacterium like E. coli can change its outer membrane protein coat in just two generations. The research demonstrates that there is a surprising amount of spatial and temporal organisation of the outer membrane within a Gram-negative bacterium and this lies at the heart of how OMPs are replenished in the membrane. Professor Kleanthous and Dr Baumann believe that their ongoing collaborative work, which began when the former was at the University of York, will have a major impact on our understanding of the bacterial outer membrane. 'It offers up many new avenues of research and also suggests new potential targets for antibiotic development, for example the disruption of OMP islands,' Professor Kleanthous said.","Published: June 18, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/algal-blooms-pose-health-risks-downstream-185886,Algal Blooms Pose Health Risks Downstream A new study has found that toxic algal blooms in reservoirs on the Klamath River can create unsafe water conditions far downstream on lower parts of the river in northern California  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Water-borne algal blooms can accumulate to concentrations that can pose health risks to people, pets and wildlife, and improved monitoring and public health outreach is needed to address this issue, researchers said. The frequency, duration and magnitude of harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. The findings were made by researchers from Oregon State University, based on data from an extensive survey of the Klamath River in 2012. The toxins may be a special concern if they are bio-accumulated in some animal species, such as freshwater mussels in which the level of the toxin can be more than 100 times higher than ambient concentrations.  It s clear that these harmful algal blooms can travel long distances on the river, delivering toxins to areas that are presently underappreciated, such as coastal margins,  said Timothy Otten, an OSU postdoctoral scholar in the OSU College of Science and College of Agricultural Sciences.  And the blooms are dynamic, since they can move up and down in the water column and are physically distributed throughout the reservoir,  he said.  This means you can t just measure water in one place and at one time and adequately estimate the public health risk.  Microcystis is a seasonal blue-green cyanobacterium found around the world, preferring warm waters in lakes and reservoirs. Some strains are toxic, others are not. Its magnitude and persistence may increase with global climate change, researchers say, and it can cause a range of health issues, including liver damage, rashes, gastrointestinal illness and other concerns. The toxin is not destroyed by boiling, making it unique from many other biological drinking water contaminants. Improved awareness of the ability of blooms to travel significant distances downstream, and communication based on that, would help better inform the public, the OSU scientists said. But individual knowledge and awareness would also help.  On a lake or river, if you see a green band along the shore or green scum on the surface, the water may not be safe to recreate in,  Otten said.  Because this problem is so diffuse, it's often not possible to put up posters or signs everywhere that there s a problem in real-time, so people need to learn what to watch for. Just as with poison ivy or oak, the general public needs to learn to recognize what these hazards look like, and know to avoid them in order to safeguard their own health.  In this and other recent research, the OSU scientists have also developed genetic tools that can help identify problems with Microcystis, more quickly and at lower cost than some older methods. But those tools have not yet been widely adopted by the monitoring community.  Right now, some lakes are not sampled at all for algal blooms, so we don t really know if there s a problem or not,  said Theo Dreher, the Pernot Professor and former chair of the Department of Microbiology in the OSU College of Science and College of Agricultural Sciences.  There s no doubt we could use improved monitoring in highly used lakes and reservoirs, or in rivers downstream of them when toxic blooms are found.  In this study, researchers found that intensive blooms of Microcystis in Iron Gate Reservoir on the Klamath River were the primary source of toxic algae observed downstream. They used genetic tracking technology to establish what many may have suspected when observing Microcystis in the lower reaches of the Klamath River. This transport of algae has been very little studied, even though it s likely common. The possible removal of dams on the Klamath River after 2020 may ultimately help mitigate this problem, the researchers said. Their study found no evidence of endemic Microcystis populations in the flowing regions of the Klamath River, both upstream and downstream of the Copco and Iron Gate reservoirs. The problem with these bacteria is national and global in scope, especially in summer. There are more than 123,000 lakes greater than 10 acres in size across the U.S., and based on an EPA National Lakes Assessment, at least one-third may contain toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Dams, rising temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, extreme weather and increased runoff of nutrients from urban and agricultural lands are all compounding the problem. Many large, eutrophic lakes such as Lake Erie are plagued each year by algal blooms so massive that they are visible from outer space. Dogs have died from drinking contaminated water, and sea otter deaths in Monterey Bay have been attributed to eating shellfish contaminated with toxin produced by Microsystis.","Published: June 18, 2015"

Allergan's 2015 earnings-per-share forecast provided on May 11, 2015 is unchanged as a result of the acquisition.  The acquisition is expected to be breakeven in 2016 and accretive thereafter.  The Company remains committed to de-levering to below 3.5x debt to Adjusted EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016. The acquisition of KYTHERA immediately enhances Allergan's global facial aesthetics portfolio with the addition of KYBELLA (deoxycholic acid) injection, the first and only approved non-surgical treatment for contouring moderate to severe submental fullness, commonly referred to as double chin.  KYBELLA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 29, 2015. KYBELLA  injection is also being developed for potential introduction into international markets; KYTHERA has submitted KYBELLA injection for regulatory approval in Switzerland, Canada and Australia, with other market applications to follow. The acquisition will also add KYTHERA's development product setipiprant (KYTH-105), a novel compound for the prevention of male pattern baldness, as well as additional early-stage development candidates.

""I am deeply appreciative of the commitment and dedication of our KYTHERA team that worked so tirelessly to bring KYBELLA  from early development through approval and launch.  We look forward to working with Allergan to ensure a successful U.S. launch of KYBELLA, as well as to secure additional approvals globally."" Submental fullness is a common yet undertreated condition that can detract from an otherwise balanced and harmonious facial appearance   leading to an older and heavier look. Submental fullness can affect adults   both women and men   of all ages, weight and gender. Influenced by multiple factors including aging and genetics, submental fullness is often resistant to diet and exercise. According to a 2015 survey by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, 67 percent of consumers are bothered by submental fullness.i KYTHERA is executing a training-led launch in the U.S. supported by a training program designed to educate physicians and qualified injectors on the safe use of KYBELLA and its approved indication. Physician faculty education in the U.S. began in June 2015. KYBELLA physician training programs will initiate in late summer. Qualified injectors in the U.S. will be able to purchase KYBELLA and treat their patients after they have been trained.

Improving bee diversity in Britain would provide farmers and consumers with an insurance policy against future ecological shocks, such as climate change, the scientists say. Professor Simon Potts, director of the Centre for Agri-Environmental Research (CAER) at the University of Reading, said:  The few bee species that currently pollinate our crops are unlikely to be the same types we will need in the future.  It is critical to protect a wide range of bees and other insects now so that, as Britain s climate, environment and crop varieties change, we can call on the pollinating species which are best suited to the task.  We can t just rely on our current starting line-up of pollinators. We need a large and diverse group of species on the substitutes  bench, ready to join the game as soon as they are needed, if we are to ensure food production remains stable.  The call comes as new research, published today in the journalNature Communications, shows that some of the most endangered insect pollinators are considered virtually valueless by simple economic measures of the natural environment, which only consider present-day agricultural and environmental needs. The international study, by scientists including a team from the University of Reading, showed that while the pollinating work of wild bees was worth more than $3,000 (around  1,900) per hectare, most of this work was done by a handful of common species, such as some types of bumblebees and solitary bees. Most other species contribute very little in the way of clear economic benefits. In fact, only 2% of potential bee species constituted 80% of crop flower visitors observed in the study. This small number of bee varieties are vital for the production of UK crops such as oilseed rape, beans, apples and strawberries. Their work would cost more than  1Bn a year to replace in the UK alone. Professor Potts, one of the report s authors, said:  Human history is full of examples of food crises caused by an over-reliance on a single crop or a dwindling number of species.  In the insect world, we have already seen how the massive decline in honeybees in Britain has led to a reliance on wild bees to do much of the pollination. At one time, honeybees were enough to pollinate most of Britain s crops. Now, there are only enough to pollinate around a quarter of them. If we didn t have other species of bees to turn to, we would already be facing a food security catastrophe.  Honeybee colonies have slumped in the UK from 250,000 in the 1950s to fewer than 100,000 today. Many British apple crops, for example, which previously relied on honeybees, are now almost exclusively pollinated by a handful of wild bee species.  Putting a cash value on ecosystem services is helpful to highlight to politicians and farmers just how important nature is to the bottom line,  said Professor Potts.  But thinking purely about today s profits is pointless if it comes at the expense of the future sustainability of our countryside and our food supply.","Published: June 18, 2015"

This is where magnetic nanoparticles come in. These balls of iron oxide, just a few tens of nanometers in diameter, heat up when exposed to a powerful magnetic field. Their purpose is to bring heat directly to the tumors. Materials research, performed in part at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), revealed magnetic behavior that proved counterintuitive to the scientific team a finding that will affect which particles are chosen for a particular treatment.  Choosing the right kind of particles is important because, depending on their structure, they deliver a different dose of heat to the cancer. Some heat up quickly at first, while others require a stronger magnetic field to get going but ultimately deliver more heat.   You want to design your nanoparticles for the kind of cancer you re treating whether it s localized or spread through the body,  says NIST s Cindi Dennis.  The amount of electricity needed to create the field can be 100 kilowatts or more. That costs a lot of money, so we want to help engineer particles that will do the best job.  Although the magnetic field applied for hyperthermia is 100 to 1,000 times weaker that that typically used for MRI imaging, Dennis explains, it s an alternating field (the magnetic polarity switches rapidly), which requires a lot more power. With colleagues at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the University of Manitoba and in industry, the team studied two kinds of iron-oxide nanoparticles, each of which has a different internal structure. In one, iron-oxide crystals are stacked neatly, like bricks in a wall; in the other, the arrangement is more haphazard, like balls in a playpen. While subjecting both types to an alternating magnetic field, the team discovered that the neatly-stacked ones needed a stronger field than expected to heat up, while the haphazard particles got hot more quickly, even when the field was still weak. It took a trip to the NCNR to figure out why these nanoparticles acted strangely. The neutron experiments showed regions of different sizes and shapes in the particles. Within each region, the so-called magnetic moments are uniform and point in the same direction. But the regions themselves did not align with each other. This unexpected behavior among regions, it turns out, profoundly affects the nanoparticles  response to a magnetic field.  ""Materials often behave unexpectedly on the nanoscale, and here we have another example of that,  Dennis says.  We expect it will help design better cancer treatments. A localized cancer could be treated with nanoparticles that give out lots of heat right away because the field can be focused on a small region. ","Published: June 18, 2015"

Carbonic acid exists for only a tiny fraction of a second when carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water before changing into a mix of protons and bicarbonate anions. Despite its short life, however, carbonic acid imparts a lasting impact on Earth s atmosphere and geology, as well as on the human body. However, because of its short lifespan, the detailed chemistry of carbonic acid has long been veiled in mystery. Researchers with Berkeley Lab and the University of California (UC) Berkeley are helping to lift this veil through a series of unique experiments.   Through a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), theoretical modeling and computational simulations, we re able to report the first detailed characterization of the hydration structure of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in water,  says Richard Saykally, a chemist with Berkeley Lab s Chemical Sciences Division and professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley who leads this research.  Our results will help improve future theoretical modeling of this crucial chemistry by characterizing the initial state of the proton transfer reactions that occur in water.  This latest work follows a separate recent study in which the hydration structure of carbonic acid itself was characterized. Ultimately, such studies will lead to a complete understanding of how atmospheric carbon dioxide is captured and transformed by ocean surfaces, a crucial role in the carbon cycle. They will also enable us to address how bicarbonate anions interact with calcium and magnesium cations in solution to create the nanoclusters that nucleate limestone formation, and how bicarbonate anions buffer blood and other bodily fluids.  Saykally and his research group have overcome the challenge of carbonic acid s short lifetime   about 26 milliseconds   by developing a unique liquid microjet mixing technology. In this technology, two aqueous samples rapidly mix and flow through a finely tipped nozzle that is made from fused silica and features an opening only a few micrometers in diameter. The resulting liquid beam is injected into a vacuum chamber and intersected by an X-ray beam before being collected and frozen out. Saykally and his group installed their liquid microjet system at Berkeley Lab s Advanced Light Source (ALS), an electron accelerator/storage ring that serves as a premier source of X-ray beams for scientific research. In earlier experiments, they used their microjet system and XAS technique to characterize the hydration structures of aqueous carbonate and bicarbonate. In this new study, Saykally and his group were able to capture the XAS spectrum of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in water. All of these experiments were performed at ALS Beamline 8.0.1, a high flux undulator beamline that generates X-ray beams optimized for XAS studies. Saykally and his colleagues determined the hydration structure of carbon dioxide in water by using their XAS spectral data in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations carried out under the leadership of David Prendergast, a staff scientist in the Theory of Nanostructures Facility at Berkeley Lab s Molecular Foundry. Calculations were performed utilizing the supercomputer resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). The ALS, the Molecular Foundry and NERSC are all national user facilities funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) s Office of Science. The results of this study show that the carbonic acid molecule acts as a hydrophobe with an average hydrogen bond number of 0.56. The carbon atom interacts weakly with the oxygen of a single water molecule at a distance of greater than 2.67 Angstroms, and the carbonyl oxygens serve as weak hydrogen bond acceptors. The result is an enhanced tetrahedral water/hydrogen bonding structure, with a local cylindrical cavity carved out in the water solvent.  Calculated spectral energy shifts and intensities between aqueous carbonic acid, dissolved carbon dioxide and gaseous carbon dioxide correspond well with our experimentally measured spectra,  Saykally says.  In future studies, we will focus on resolving some limitations of our current experimental design  and the limitations of molecular dynamics modeling through the implementation of higher level ab initio theories.","Published: June 18, 2015"

The first uses are likely to be in testing new cardiovascular drugs and blood thinners, where blood flow is critical to predicting performance, says Shuichi Takayama, U-M professor of biomedical engineering and macromolecular science and engineering who is one of the creators of the device. ""This chip gives us a bridge between the petri dish and the patient,"" Takayama said. ""Cells behave much more naturally when they're subjected to the pulsing rhythms inside the body, as opposed to sitting in a static environment in the lab. So, by duplicating those rhythms on a chip, we can perform much more accurate lab tests before we begin testing on patients."" While previous devices have been able to recreate the pulse of a heartbeat outside the body, they required the use of a syringe pump operated by a lab technician, which made long-term tests difficult. The new device is much simpler to operate and can run unattended for long periods of time. The steady input pressure also makes it possible to run multiple pulse rates and pressures on a single chip. This is a big step forward because it enables technicians to run multiple tests at once, Takayama says. ""Different types of patients have different pulse rates,"" he said. ""For example, a septic patient's heart may beat faster or one blood vessel may have a different flow rate than another. Those factors influence how a given therapy will affect a cell. We can now replicate those factors and many others on a single chip and run the tests simultaneously."" Developed at the Biointerfaces Institute and Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, the chip uses an intricate network of microscopic, gravity-driven channels, capacitors and switches to make liquids flow across it in an unlimited variety of pulses and flow rates. It enables researchers to test new therapies on human cell samples that have been injected into the device, in an environment that closely mimics conditions inside the body. Takayama says the chip can also be used to duplicate other biorhythms in the body, like signals within the brain and hormone delivery. ""For example, we generally study liver cells' response to insulin by giving them a big dose all at once,"" he said. ""But in the body, the liver gets insulin from the pancreas in a series of tiny pulses. We could use this chip to duplicate those pulses and create a much more accurate model of what's happening in the body."" The chip operates much like an electronic processor in a computer, but it uses fluid instead of electricity. Sung-Jin Kim, a former researcher in Takayama's lab who is now an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at KonKuk Univ. in Seoul, South Korea, explains that developing switches and capacitors that use fluid is simple in principle but was difficult to put into practice. ""One of our biggest challenges was building a gravity-driven microfluidic circuit that works reliably,"" he said. ""Because unlike electronics, microfluidic switches need negative pressure to close properly. We eventually realized that we could control the pressure of the system by positioning the outflow well at a measured distance below the chip, creating just the right amount of pressure."" The team uses CAD-design software to custom-design each chip to exact specifications, then uses a combination of soft lithography and photolithography to mold the chip out of silicon rubber at a cost of only a few cents each. Because the chips are used in the lab and not on humans, Kim says researchers can begin using them right away. He says the team has no immediate plans for commercialization, but they may begin sharing the design with researchers on a noncommercial basis in a matter of months.","Published: June 18, 2015"

Funds for the purchase of the laboratory systems were provided by the government-backed FAPESP research foundation, a body that supports fundamental and applied research projects as well as backing the development of the required infrastructure. The new facility houses a latest generation Albira trimodal preclinical imaging instrument from Bruker. This revolutionary system features high resolution and superior image quality, and its rapid multimodal acquisition and reconstruction gives researchers a more complete picture and deeper insights into the causes and effects of disease.   Pre-clinical imaging is playing a growing role in the study of a wide range of diseases; by providing 3D molecular images in vivo researchers in, for example, oncology, cardiology, orthopedics, neurology, metabolism studies and new pharmaceuticals can advance their understanding of the fundamental basis of disease. Licio Augusto Velloso, the FCM researcher and coordinator of Cepid-OCRC, explained: ""Because preclinical imaging procedures are not invasive we can follow a subject over a long period of time, significantly reducing the number of animals needed for our research. In addition, the equipment will enable the integration of basic research with translational and clinical findings. This will bring considerable advances in improving the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases."" The focus of the Cepid-OCRC is to provide the core facilities that allow basic, translational and clinical research, integrate a multidisciplinary team of investigators to collaboratively address critical research questions and create new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Furthermore, the center will be a focus for educating the next generation of scientists and investigators in the field.  The Coordinator of the Clinical Research Center (CPC) of FCM, Andrei Carvalho Sposito, said:  the inauguration of the lab and the installation of the equipment will promote closer integration among researchers at UNICAMP and deliver greater international impact of research produced by the institution.  The Coordinator of the postgraduate Committee of the FCM, Rosana Onocko Fields, representing FCM Director Ivan Felizardo Contrera Toro and the Associate Director of College Roberto Teixeira Mendes, added:  This moment marks a fruitful partnership with FAPESP.  A view echoed by the words of the Scientific Director of FAPESP, Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz, who said:  A thriving center needs all the right ingredients   security to offer long research contracts to the best staff, and the ability to invest in equipment that is required is also important.""  Scott Ireland, Preclinical Imaging Sales Manager for South America, Bruker, commented:  We are very proud to be part of this ground-breaking facility. Our consistent goal is to develop instrumentation that allows researchers around the world new capabilities and new opportunities to advance the understanding of disease conditions such as obesity. We share the aspirations of the group here and look forward to working with the scientists to ensure they extract the most powerful data from our systems. ","Published: June 18, 2015"

The findings may lead the way to improved treatment and understanding of these common disorders, researchers said. Post-concussion psychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety and irritability can be extremely disabling for those among the nearly 3.8 million people in the United States who suffer concussions every year. The mechanisms underlying these changes after concussion--also known as mild traumatic brain injury--are not sufficiently understood, and conventional MRI results in most of these patients are normal. For the new study, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in Pittsburgh used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MRI technique that measures the integrity of white matter--the brain's signal-transmitting nerve fibers--to see if injuries to the nerves may be the root cause of these post-traumatic depression and anxiety symptoms. The researchers obtained DTI and neurocognitive testing results for 45 post-concussion patients, including 38 with irritability, 32 with depression and 18 with anxiety, and compared the results with those of 29 post-concussion patients who had no neuropsychiatric symptoms. ""Using other concussion patients as our controls was a big advantage of our study,"" said lead author Lea M. Alhilali, M.D., assistant professor of radiology at UPMC. ""When you are able to study a similar population with similar risk factors, you get much more reliable results."" The researchers saw unique white matter injury patterns in the patients who had depression or anxiety. Compared to controls, patients with depression had decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of the structural integrity of white matter connections, around an area near the deep gray matter of the brain that is strongly associated with the brain's reward circuit. ""The regions injured in concussion patients with depression were very similar to those of people with non-traumatic major depression disorder,"" Dr. Alhilali said. ""This suggests there may be similar mechanisms to non-trauma and trauma-dependent depression that may help guide treatment."" Anxiety patients had diminished FA in a part of the brain called the vermis that helps modulate fear-related behaviors. Since the vermis has not been associated with dysfunction in non-traumatic anxiety disorders, this finding may indicate that different treatment targets are required for patients with anxiety after trauma, the researchers said. No regions of significantly decreased FA were seen in patients with irritability relative to the control subjects. ""There are two major implications for this study,"" Dr. Alhilali said. ""First, it gives us insight into how abnormalities in the brain occur after trauma, and second, it shows that treatments for non-trauma patients with neuropsychological symptoms may be applicable to some concussion patients."" The study also raises the possibility that some people diagnosed with non-traumatic depression may actually have experienced a subclinical traumatic event at some point earlier in their lives that may have contributed to the development of depression, she noted. In the future, the researchers hope to compare DTI findings in concussion patients with depression to those of people who have non-trauma-related depressive disorders.

The Internet phenomenon of watching cat videos, from Lil Bub to Grumpy Cat, does more than simply entertain; it boosts viewers' energy and positive emotions and decreases negative feelings, according to a new study by an Indiana University Media School researcher. The study, by assistant professor Jessica Gall Myrick, surveyed almost 7,000 people about their viewing of cat videos and how it affects their moods. It was published in the latest issue of Computers in Human Behavior. Lil Bub s owner, Mike Bridavsky, who lives in Bloomington, helped distribute the survey via social media.  Some people may think watching online cat videos isn t a serious enough topic for academic research, but the fact is that it s one of the most popular uses of the Internet today,  Myrick said.  If we want to better understand the effects the Internet may have on us as individuals and on society, then researchers can t ignore Internet cats anymore.  We all have watched a cat video online, but there is really little empirical work done on why so many of us do this, or what effects it might have on us,  added Myrick, who owns a pug but no cats.  As a media researcher and online cat video viewer, I felt compelled to gather some data about this pop culture phenomenon.  Internet data show there were more than 2 million cat videos posted on YouTube in 2014, with almost 26 billion views. Cat videos had more views per video than any other category of YouTube content. In Myrick s study, the most popular sites for viewing cat videos were Facebook, YouTube, Buzzfeed and I Can Has Cheezburger. Among the possible effects Myrick hoped to explore: Does viewing cat videos online have the same kind of positive impact as pet therapy? And do some viewers actually feel worse after watching cat videos because they feel guilty for putting off tasks they need to tackle? Of the participants in the study, about 36 percent described themselves as a  cat person,  while about 60 percent said they liked both cats and dogs. Participants in Myrick s study reported: Overall, the response to watching cat videos was largely positive.  Even if they are watching cat videos on YouTube to procrastinate or while they should be working, the emotional pay-off may actually help people take on tough tasks afterward,  Myrick said. The results also suggest that future work could explore how online cat videos might be used as a form of low-cost pet therapy, she said. For each participant who took the survey, Myrick donated 10 cents to Lil Bub s foundation, raising almost $700. The foundation, Lil Bub s Big Fund for the ASPCA, has raised more than $100,000 for needy animals. Indiana University Bloomington   press release Jessica Gall Myrick.

His research is at the cross-roads of nanotechnology and microbiology where the goal is to gain insight into the nanometer-scale surface architecture and molecular interactions of microbes. Two main topics are: understanding the spatial organization of the cell wall and deciphering the molecular mechanisms of cell adhesion. The general strategy involves combining novel AFM modalities for probing bacterial cell surfaces (combined AFM-fluorescence imaging of live cells, high-speed imaging of cell surface structure, quantitative multiparametric imaging of cell surface properties, advanced single molecule and single-cell force spectroscopy measurements) with genetic and biophysical methods to characterize a range of organisms of biotechnological or biomedical importance. These nanoscale analyses will shed new light into the structure-function relationships of microbial cell surfaces.  Looking more deeply at his work, Dr Dufr ne says  the completion of our multidisciplinary research requires a novel, state-of-the-art AFM for the nanoscale analysis of live cells hence our choice of the NanoWizard  from JPK Instruments. This is equipped with a series of advanced capabilities that are essential for the project. First, the combination of AFM with a high-quality inverted optical microscope will allows us to optically guide AFM analyses (selection of a cell of interest, followed by targeted AFM measurements), therefore improving dramatically the throughput and quality of single-cell analyses. In addition, this AFM-optical microscopy platform will make it possible to directly correlate AFM topographic images with fluorescence images and to prepare living cell probes for single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) measurements. Secondly, the new high-speed module will complement traditional topographic imaging of bacterial cell surfaces by providing a more dynamic view of the cell surface (cell surface organization, relaxation and turnover; cell wall remodelling in response to drugs). We believe this project is a unique opportunity to push the limits of high-speed AFM in microbiology. Third, an advanced single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) package will enable us to image and manipulate, at high resolution, single cell surface constituents. This package will include the force-clamp mode, which will provide novel insights into the adhesive and mechanical properties of the adhesins. Fourth, the newly developed multiparametric imaging mode (also named quantitative imaging, QI ) will allow us to dramatically increase the spatiotemporal resolution of SMFS-based imaging, and to correlate the localization of single cell surface constituents with local changes in adhesion and elasticity. Fifth, the unique cell adhesion force module (CellHesion  module) will guarantee reliable, state-of-the art single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) measurements, and will permit, for the first time, long-range z-spectroscopy (up to 100  m), thereby enabling to unravel molecular interactions that were not accessible before.

SHINE is one of two private industry partners working with Argonne to develop domestic sources of Mo-99 in research funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). In its partnership with NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, Argonne is providing its technical expertise on two different processes to meet the Mo-99 need.  The development of techniques for domestic production of Mo-99 is a critical national priority and one fully supported by our work at Argonne,  said George Vandegrift, an Argonne Distinguished Fellow who leads the Mo-99 development efforts.  Millions of patients each year rely on Mo-99 for life-saving diagnostic procedures, but the stability and safety of that supply is threatened by a variety of factors.  Mo-99 production faces several issues, beginning with its traditional production method using highly enriched uranium (HEU) in research reactors. HEU presents a risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, so NNSA has focused on the development of other methods for Mo-99 production and conversion of reactors to use low-enriched uranium (LEU). Mo-99 is also not produced in the United States, leaving the country to rely on isotopes from other sources in other countries, including a Canadian research reactor that will cease regular production next year, reducing the global supply. The short half-life of Mo-99 and its decay product, Tc-99m, makes timely global transportation of the isotope a challenge. Tc-99m is used as a radioactive tracer element in more than 40 million medical diagnostic procedures each year, including heart stress tests and bone scans. The isotope is created when Mo-99 spontaneously decays through the release of a beta particle from its nucleus. Because of its unstable nature, Mo-99 does not occur naturally and must be created using various techniques. The SHINE process demonstration bombarded an LEU uranyl sulfate solution with fast neutrons generated using Argonne s linear accelerator, breaking the LEU down into hundreds of isotopes, including Mo-99, which originates in six percent of the fissions created in the process. The Mo-99 must then be separated from the other fission products before it can be transported for use. Argonne s analysis of the Mo-99 from the demonstration showed it met the purity specifications of the industry standard, the British Pharmacopoeia. Argonne also supports NorthStar s process to modify stable isotopes of molybdenum to create Mo-99. In one process, enriched Mo-98 targets are bombarded with neutrons, resulting in neutron capture and creation of Mo-99. In the other, enriched Mo-100 targets are bombarded with X-rays from an electron linear accelerator, expelling a neutron from the nucleus to create Mo-99. Argonne will continue working with both companies to demonstrate the feasibility of their processes as SHINE and NorthStar look to commercialize the production of Mo-99.  This is a complicated undertaking, but given the medical need and national security implications, it is an effort Argonne is proud to be involved with,  said Mark Peters, associate laboratory director for Energy and Global Security at Argonne.  This type of public-private partnership on issues of national importance demonstrates the benefits that can come from the work of our national labs. ","Published: June 17, 2015"

""This is a win-win process because the screening can be harnessed to target any region of the genome and the experiment will tell you whether the region is expendable or not."" The investigators were able to engineer the CRISPR-Cas system to eliminate the four genomic regions, which the team labeled as mobile genetic elements, and then observed some interesting results. ""Once that region was gone, the bacteria could no longer preserve milk, yet the cells were still alive,"" stated Kurt Selle, Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Barrangou s laboratory and lead author on the study. ""That result showed that this area was expendable and not essential to bacterial survival when not growing in milk."" Another unexpected and interesting outcome came after the NC State team deleted the milk utilization region within S. thermophiles, they saw a 5% reduction in size of the bacterial genome when all four regions were eliminated the overall shrinkage was 7%. ""We did not expect that magnitude of reduction in a relatively small genome,"" Dr. Barrangou said. ""When you use pinpointed targeting of a specific portion of the genome, you expect a smaller deletion to occur."" Dr. Barrangou and his team believe that the same techniques they employed for their current study could be used to study essential and nonessential genomic regions in any bacterium of interest perhaps even be used to target antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial pathogens.

Unlike energy-storing white, or  bad,  fat cells,  good  brown fat cells make a protein called UCP1 that converts energy stored in glucose and fatty acids into heat to keep the body warm. When active, brown fat cells can also use energy stored by white fat cells, and as a result reduce the size of nearby white fat cells.Human brown fat progenitor cells express the calorie-burning, UCP1 proteins (green) as the cell differentiates. Courtesy of Tseng Laboratory, Joslin Diabetes Center. The research team, made up of scientists at Harvard University and at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center and led by HSCI principal faculty member Yu-Hua Tseng, determined that the amount of energy burned varies from person to person and from cell to cell. As it turns out, said Tseng,  Not all fat cells are created equal.  The researchers determined that a whole suite of genes help determine how much UCP1 a brown fat cell will produce once it has matured, and those genes control UCP1 production in different ways. Some, Tseng said, act like on/off switches: When the gene is on, a brown fat cell can make the energy-burning protein, and when it is turned off, it doesn t. Other genes acted more like a light dimmer that adjusts or fine tunes the amount of UPC1 created. Knowing which genes control UCP1 should help scientists develop therapies.  We could take fat samples from patients undergoing liposuction and we could purify this specific population of progenitor cells,  keeping only those that would eventually make highly active brown fat cells,  and let them differentiate into brown cells, and then get them back into the individual,  Tseng said. Once reintroduced to the patient s body, the additional brown fat cells would burn energy from the existing white fat cells. Tseng hopes this technique could eventually replace invasive procedures such as liposuction and gastric bypass surgery. While liposuction removes white fat cells, it does not make the brown fat cells more efficient. And gastric bypass, though life-saving, can be risky. Tseng believes cell therapy would be  much safer and much less invasive.  Controlling the genes might allow scientists to make mediocre brown fat cells work better. This could potentially allow the brown fat cells to remove the high numbers of circulating glucose associated with type 2 diabetes and circulating fatty acids and triglycerides that are the hallmark of metabolic syndrome.  By further understanding how adipose cells become thermogenically active, meaning they use energy to produce heat and thus burn calories, we may discover novel therapeutics for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease,  said Chad Cowan, an HSCI principal faculty member who, among other things, also studies the therapeutic potential of brown fat cells. In 2014, Cowan identified two drugs with the potential to convert stem cells that make white fat into those that would make brown.  This latest study gives us new tools and targets to use in the battle against obesity,  Cowan said.","Published: June 17, 2015"

Following the financing and merger, we have $27 million in cash, which we expect will fund our business into 2017, beyond multiple data readouts from ongoing and planned clinical studies, as well as other corporate milestones,  Dr. Clarke said. Participants in the private placement included pre-merger investors in Pulmatrix such as funds affiliated with 5AM Ventures, ARCH Venture Partners and Polaris Partners, as well as funds affiliated with Altitude Life Science Ventures. Pulmatrix also revealed lead candidate PUR1900, a preclinical compound that the company said was the first inhaled anti-infective to treat fungal infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). PUR1900 is an iSPERSE formulation incorporating an anti-fungal compound that can be administered at high therapeutic dose to the lung while minimizing systemic side effects. According to the company, nearly 50% of CF patients experience pulmonary fungal infections that can cause chronic bronchitis or allergic reactions, resulting in inflammation and poor long term outcomes.

These trials, which have been used for years, were designed to determine the true efficacy of a treatment free from patient or doctor bias, but they do not factor in the effects that patient behaviors, such as diet and lifestyle choices, can have on the tested treatment. A recent meta-analysis of six such clinical trials, led by Caltech's Erik Snowberg, professor of economics and political science, and his colleagues Sylvain Chassang from Princeton University and Ben Seymour from Cambridge University, shows that behavior can have a serious impact on the effectiveness of a treatment--and that the currently used DBRCT procedures may not be able to assess the effects of behavior on the treatment. To solve this, the researchers propose a new trial design, called a two-by-two trial, that can account for behavior-treatment interactions. Patients behave in different ways during a trial. These behaviors can directly relate to the trial--for example, one patient who believes in the drug may religiously stick to his or her treatment regimen while someone more skeptical might skip a few doses. The behaviors may also simply relate to how the person acts in general, such as preferences in diet, exercise, and social engagement. And in the design of today's standard trials, these behaviors are not accounted for, Snowberg says. For example, a DBRCT might randomly assign patients to one of two groups: an experimental group that receives the new treatment and a control group that does not. As the trial is double-blinded, neither the subjects nor their doctors know who falls into which group. This is intended to reduce bias from the behavior and beliefs of the patient and the doctor; the thinking is that because patients have not been specifically selected for treatment, any effects on health outcomes must be solely due to the treatment or lack of treatment. However, although the patients do not know whether they have received the treatment, they do know their probability of getting the treatment--in this case, 50 percent. And that 50 percent likelihood of getting the new treatment might not be enough to encourage a patient to change behaviors that could influence the efficacy of the drug under study, Snowberg says. For example, if you really want to lose weight and know you have a high probability--say 70 percent chance--of being in the experimental group for a new weight loss drug, you may be more likely to take the drug as directed and to make other healthy lifestyle choices that can contribute to weight loss. As a result, you might lose more weight, boosting the apparent effectiveness of the drug. However, if you know you only have a 30 percent chance of being in the experimental group, you might be less motivated to both take the drug as directed and to make those other changes. As a result, you might lose less weight--even if you are in the treatment group--and the same drug would seem less effective. ""Most medical research just wants to know if a drug will work or not. We wanted to go a step further, designing new trials that would take into account the way people behave. As social scientists, we naturally turned to the mathematical tools of formal social science to do this,"" Snowberg says. Snowberg and his colleagues found that with a new trial design, the two-by-two trial, they can tease out the effects of behavior and the interaction of behavior and treatment, as well as the effects of treatment alone. The new trial, which still randomizes treatment, also randomizes the probability of treatment--which can change a patient's behavior. In a two-by-two trial, instead of patients first being assigned to either the experimental or control groups, they are randomly assigned to either a ""high probability of treatment"" group or a ""low probability of treatment"" group. The patients in the high probability group are then randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group, giving them a 70 percent chance of receiving the treatment. Patients in the low probability group are also randomly assigned to treatment or control; their likelihood of receiving the treatment is 30 percent. The patients are then informed of their probability of treatment. By randomizing both the treatment and the probability of treatment, medical researchers can quantify the effects of treatment, the effects of behavior, and the effects of the interaction between treatment and behavior. Determining each, Snowberg says, is essential for understanding the overall efficacy of treatment. ""It's a very small change to the design of the trial, but it's important. The effect of a treatment has these two constituent parts: pure treatment effect and the treatment-behavior interaction. Standard blind trials just randomize the likelihood of treatment, so you can't see this interaction. Although you can't just tell someone to randomize their behavior, we found a way that you can randomize the probability that a patient will get something that will change their behavior."" Because it is difficult to implement new trial design changes in active trials, Snowberg and his colleagues wanted to first test their idea with a meta-analysis of data from previous clinical trials. They developed a way to test this idea by coming up with a new mathematical formula that can be used to analyze DBRCT data. The formula, which teases out the health outcomes resulting from treatment alone as well as outcomes resulting from an interaction between treatment and behavior, was then used to statistically analyze six previous DBRCTs that had tested the efficacy of two antidepressant drugs, imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant also known as Tofranil) and paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sold as Paxil). First, the researchers wanted to see if there was evidence that patients behave differently when they have a high probability of treatment versus when they have a low probability of treatment. The previous trials recorded how many patients dropped out of the study, so this was the behavior that Snowberg and his colleagues analyzed. They found that in trials where patients happened to have a relatively high probability of treatment--near 70 percent--the dropout rate was significantly lower than in other trials with patients who had a lower probability of treatment, around 50 percent. Although the team did not have any specific behaviors to analyze, other than dropping out of the study, they also wanted to determine if behavior in general could have added to the effect of the treatments. Using their statistical techniques, they determined that imipramine seemed to have a pure treatment effect, but no effect from the interaction between treatment and behavior--that is, the drug seemed to work fine, regardless of any behavioral differences that may have been present. However, after their analysis, they determined that paroxetine seemed to have no effect from the treatment alone or behavior alone. However, an interaction between the treatment and behavior did effectively decrease depression. Because this was a previously performed study, the researchers cannot know which specific behavior was responsible for the interaction, but with the mathematical formula, they can tell that this behavior was necessary for the drug to be effective. In their paper, Snowberg and his colleagues speculate how a situation like this might come about. ""Maybe there is a drug, for instance, that makes people feel better in social situations, and if you're in the high probability group, then maybe you'd be more willing to go out to parties to see if the drug helps you talk to people,"" Snowberg explains. ""Your behavior drives you to go to the party, and once you're at the party, the drug helps you feel comfortable talking to people. That would be an example of an interaction effect; you couldn't get that if people just took this drug alone at home."" Although this specific example is just speculation, Snowberg says that the team's actual results reveal that there is some behavior or set of behaviors that interact with paroxetine to effectively treat depression--and without this behavior, the drug appears to be ineffective. ""Normally what you get when you run a standard blind trial is some sort of mishmash of the treatment effect and the treatment-behavior interaction effect. But, knowing the full interaction effect is important. Our work indicates that clinical trials underestimate the efficacy of a drug where behavior matters,"" Snowberg says. ""It may be the case that 50 percent probability isn't high enough for people to change any of their behaviors, especially if it's a really uncertain new treatment. Then it's just going to look like the drug doesn't work, and that isn't the case."" Because the meta-analysis supported the team's hypothesis--that the interaction between treatment and behavior can have an effect on health outcomes--the next step is incorporating these new ideas into an active clinical trial. Snowberg says that the best fit would be a drug trial for a condition, such as a mental health disorder or an addiction, that is known to be associated with behavior. At the very least, he says, he hopes that these results will lead the medical research community to a conversation about ways to improve the DBRCT and move past the current ""gold standard.""","Published: June 17, 2015"

Australian healthcare company Medical Developments International (MDI) will use a new low-cost manufacturing process developed with CSIRO to increase their production of Penthrox's underlying drug methoxyflurane by ten-fold in order to meet this large-scale demand.   Penthrox is made in Melbourne and has significant advantages over other analgesics such as nitrous oxide and morphine in that it is rapid, self-administered, non-addictive, non-narcotic, safe to use and provides strong pain relief. MDI's CEO John Sharman believes that regulatory approval to sell the product in England, France, Ireland and Belgium is a company-making achievement that has opened the door to supplying it globally.  ""Hospitals, ambulances, defence forces, national sporting leagues, life savers and other emergency services have been using 'the green whistle' in Australia for more than 30 years,"" Mr Sharman said.  ""We believe that Penthrox offers an effective alternative to established products already used in Europe and expanding into this market has substantially increased our business overnight.  ""Our partnership with CSIRO has been integral to up-scaling our production capacity ahead of this opportunity. Together, we've come up with a new, smarter process to manufacture Penthrox.""   CSIRO and MDI have been working together for more than 15 years, having developed the initial production process together, to now vastly improving it. The technology will secure their market position as the only global manufacturer of methoxyflurane. ""It's through long-term research collaborations that we can help forward-thinking businesses like MDI jump on new opportunities and remain globally competitive,"" CSIRO's biomedical research program director Dr Paul Savage said.

Adrenergics, Inc., CadheRx Therapeutics, Inc., and Calporta Therapeutics, Inc., will each receive up to $10 million in a Series A financing and R&D support from Avalon Ventures and GSK. All three companies will be located at COI Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, the community of innovation established by Avalon Ventures to provide operational support, a fully equipped R&D facility and an experienced leadership team to its life science portfolio companies.  ""Avalon's nimble start-up mentality aligned with the unparalleled R&D expertise and resources of a global pharmaceutical giant like GSK has proven to be a powerful engine for identifying exciting early-stage research for translation into drug candidates, producing six new biotech companies from this collaboration over the last two years,"" said Jay Lichter, Ph.D., managing director of Avalon Ventures.  ""These newly created companies bear the hallmarks of the type of projects we are looking for: novel targets with an established mechanism of action, a clear clinical path in a defined patient population and potential to expand into other indications."" The collaboration between Avalon Ventures and GSK was established in April 2013 and will provide up to $495 million to fund a total of 10 new companies through preclinical proof of concept. Previously announced companies that have been launched through the collaboration include Sitari Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Silarus Therapeutics, Inc. and Thyritope Biosciences, Inc.  ""This collaboration underscores how large pharmaceutical companies and venture capitalists are working closely to leverage resources and expertise into a powerful vehicle that is bridging the gap between academia and entrepreneurship,"" said Lon Cardon, senior vice president, Alternative Discovery & Development at GSK. ""Through our collaboration with Avalon Ventures, we are streamlining innovation at the earliest stages, creating the potential to increase the efficiency of drug discovery, which will ultimately benefit patients.""  Adrenergics is developing novel therapeutics to treat dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in patients that do not respond to existing therapies. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the muscle of the heart which usually starts in the left ventricle, the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping activity. Thinning of the left ventricle causes it to not pump blood effectively, resulting in inefficient blood supply throughout the body. While the condition may cause no noticeable symptoms, it can cause irregular heartbeat or blood clots and it may be life threatening. Existing DCM treatments, while beneficial for a number of patients, do not address a significant driver of disease progression that is present in a large proportion of DCM patients. Adrenergics is focusing on this key disease driver to develop medicines that are expected to modulate disease progression leading to improved outcomes in this difficult-to-treat patient population. CadheRx is developing therapeutic antibodies targeting soluble E-cadherin (sEcad) for the treatment of solid tumors that are resistant to other treatments, particularly Cetuximab and Herceptin resistant epithelial cancers. sEcad levels are increased in many epithelial cancers and result in increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that antibodies targeting sEcad inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death through apoptotic pathways in EGFR+/KRAS+ or BRAF+ Cetuximab resistant cell lines and tumors, as well as Her2+/Herceptin resistant cell lines and tumors. CadheRx was founded on intellectual property in-licensed from the laboratory of Sabine Brouxhon, M.D., Clinical Associate Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine in the School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. Calporta is developing selective small molecule agonists of TRPML1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin subfamily, member 1) for the treatment of Niemann-Pick C Disease (NPC) and other lysosomal storage diseases. Mutations that cause NPC lead to impaired intracellular lipid trafficking and lead to lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and biolipds. TRPML1 is an ion channel in the lysosome and a key regulator of lysosomal trafficking processes. Impaired TRPML1 function has been implicated in multiple pathological conditions, including NPC. Agonists of TRPML1 restore calcium efflux and normalize lysosomal trafficking and function. In addition to NPC and other lysosomal storage diseases, agonists of TRPML1 may have broad potential in other diseases such as muscular dystrophy and various taopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. Calporta's approach is based on research from the lab of Haoxing Xu, Ph.D., at the University of Michigan. Based on the terms of the Avalon-GSK collaboration, Avalon will provide Adrenergics, CadheRx and Calporta with executive leadership and operational management consistent with its current portfolio strategy. GSK has the option to acquire each of the companies upon the identification of a clinical candidate. Should GSK elect not to exercise this option on any of the companies, ownership of those companies will remain with Avalon, and Avalon will be free to enter into other strategic transactions.","Published: June 17, 2015"

The findings show promise as a practical method of biocontainment as advances in synthetic biology and genetic engineering prompt more research into techniques to control newly created organisms, said senior author J. Christopher Anderson, an associate professor of bioengineering.The researchers used the chemical benzothiazole as a molecular key to activate essential genes in bacteria. The red highlights the areas targeted for mutation. The method demonstrates a cheap, easy technique that could be used for the biocontainment of genetically modified organisms. (Image by Gabriel Lopez). The researchers worked with a strain of E.coli commonly used in research labs, targeting five genes that are required for the organism to survive and devising easy ways to modify them. They created mutations in the genes that would require the addition of the molecule benzothiazole in order to function.  This approach is very robust and simple in that it only requires a few mutations in the genome,  said Anderson.  The molecule serves as the key, and we engineer the lock.  Study lead author Gabriel Lopez, who started the project as a UC Berkeley graduate student in bioengineering, compared the approach to taking out a component in a car.  The car would still run if it lost its rear-view mirror, but it wouldn t go far without the camshaft or fuel tank,  said Lopez, now a postdoctoral researcher in Anderson s lab.  Organisms are the same. Some parts are essential, and some aren t. Of the 4,000 genes in E.coli, about 300 are essential to its survival. What we re doing is putting an ignition switch onto a handful of the bacteria s essential genes. Without the right key, the bug won t live.  The technique turns the bacteria into a synthetic auxotroph, an organism modified to require a particular compound for its growth. It could potentially be applied to organisms being engineered to treat diseases, the researchers said. Because those pharmaceuticals entail the introduction of organisms into the body, mechanisms are needed to ensure that the organism is activated only when needed. Lopez said they added redundancy in the system by adding several lock-and-key combinations into one organism. Switching on a single gene improved viability 100 millionfold, and combining several gene locks resulted in a 10 billionfold increase in viability, according to the study.  This is just one instance of how you can do it, but my hope is that people will see this and realize we can use this lock-and-key approach with other proteins and other organisms,  said Lopez. The researchers noted that other approaches to biocontainment rely upon a  kill switch  that poisons an organism. The concern, they said is that the organism may evolve a way to survive that signal. They noted that in their approach, the default state of their organism is death, and that researchers must actively turn on the genes to enable its survival. They distinguished their approach as being fast, cheap and easy to deploy, having been demonstrated in an industrially relevant organism. The inspiration came from techniques dating back to the 1940s, when early biochemists were researching the conditions that would enable microbes to live or die. Biologists discovered that mutating the genes of mold could alter their sensitivity to pH levels, temperature and other conditions.  I took those early tools used to figure out how biology works and applied those techniques for making biology work when, where and how we want,  said Lopez. The researchers cautioned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to biocontainment.  We have to look at what it is that we re worried about with which application in determining which biocontainment approach is relevant,  said Anderson. The lock-and-key approach, for instance, is not a practical answer for containing engineered DNA sequences from horizontal gene transfer, a situation in which genetic material could accidentally move from one organism to another, Anderson said. In addition, this technique is meant to prevent the accidental spread of an engineered organism, but it is not foolproof against intentional attempts to thwart the biosafety net.  We re never going to be able to solve the problem of a human actively hacking away at our safety systems,  said Lopez.  Even if we could beat a human today, there will be better equipment and more knowledge 10 years from now, and that will be very hard to secure against. ","Published: June 17, 2015"

The new shell developed by CSIRO, The University of Adelaide and the Australian Synchrotron, could hold the key to cost-effectively preserving and extending the shelf-life of vaccines in extreme temperatures without refrigeration.  This could significantly benefit healthcare in developing countries where life-saving vaccines often need to be transported over long distances to reach everyone who needs them.  Like a house is made of bricks, living organisms are made up of proteins which play a critical role in the body,  CSIRO lead researcher Dr Kang Liang said.   But unlike bricks, proteins are fragile and their function alters or perishes when exposed to heat, pressure and pollutants.   Inspired by a sea urchin s outer shell, which supports and protects its fragile body, we ve come up with a porous shell that grows around important proteins such as enzymes to protect them on the inside.   Our shell offers a low-cost solution to protecting proteins for making and enhancing drugs and other products where sensitivity has long been an issue.  The shell is made of an extremely porous material called metal organic frameworks (MOFs) that has a flexible and customisable cage-like structure. The shell s tiny cage holes are similar to a sea creature s pores and are designed to capture, trap or release specific biomolecules,  Dr Liang said.  It also paves the way to making new and improved consumer products. For example, shell-encapsulated enzymes in laundry washing powder would perform better, resulting in cleaner, softer and more fragrant clothing in less time.  CSIRO research team leader, Dr Paolo Falcaro said they are now seeking industry partners to develop the technology for specific applications including pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, chemical and food processing, water decontamination and screening for genetic disease.   We are currently investigating important biomolecules including DNA, antibodies and those used in vaccines,  Dr Falcaro said.   Based on our laboratory trials, the shell could protect a vaccine vial for only a few dollars and at a commercial scale we would work to make it even cheaper. This cost is insignificant when a vaccine can cost up to hundreds of dollars per dose.  CSIRO is developing a range of technologies for making and using MOFs that span capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, separating and storing gases, and decontaminating water and soils. These technologies offer industry significant productivity and environmental benefits.  Later this year, Dr Liang will join fellow CSIRO colleague Dr Paul Berkman and 11 other young Australians who were selected to attend the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting   the Oscars equivalent of the science world.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-immunoregulation-and-biomarker-202656,New Immunoregulation and Biomarker Clinicians at LMU have elucidated a mechanism involved in determining the lifespan of antibody producing cells  and identified a promising new biomarker for monitoring autoimmune diseases   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The so-called humoral immune response is mediated by plasma cells and plays a central role in combating infections. Plasma cells secrete antibodies   a class of proteins that specifically recognize infectious pathogens and facilitate their destruction. Individual plasma cells make only a single species of antibody that normally recognizes a single structure. Nevertheless, antibodies with certain specificities may erroneously attack the tissues of their host, causing autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Balanced regulation of the production and activity of plasma cells is therefore vital,  says Professor Edgar Meinl (LMU Medical Center). Long-term antibody-mediated immunity is provided by so-called long-lived plasma cells, and Meinl and his research team have now identified a novel mechanism involved in regulating the lifespan of these antibody producing cells. This involves the shedding of a particular cell-surface receptor, named BCMA, which is known to bind factors that promote plasma-cell survival. The released segment that is cut off the receptor can be detected in the circulation, and the LMU group has shown that it provides a useful biomarker for monitoring the severity of autoimmune conditions. The new findings appear in the online journal  Nature Communications . Protease g-secretase truncates receptor Plasma cells develop from progenitors called B-cells that carry specific membrane-bound receptors which recognize foreign proteins termed antigens. When a B cell encounters its cognate antigen, it differentiates into a clone of plasma cells that secrete the antigen-binding protein in soluble form as antibody. How long an antibody-producing plasma cell survives in the body depends largely on the survival receptor BCMA. When the BCMA binds its ligands, the survival factors BAFF and APRIL, a genetic program is activated which effectively extends the lifespan of the plasma cell.  However, the lifetime of plasma cells cannot be prolonged indefinitely. Otherwise the organism would become swamped with antibodies, increasing the risk of an autoimmune reaction,  Meinl explains.  We have now shown, in cooperation with colleagues in Munich, Berlin and Stockholm, that the membrane-bound enzyme gamma-secretase acts as a brake on immune reactions by fragmenting BCMA.  As a so-called transmembrane receptor, BCMA extends through the cell membrane and projects into the extracellular medium. Gamma-secretase removes the exposed portion by cutting the protein inside of the plasma membrane. That this enzyme cleaves the receptor directly was a surprise:  Up to now, it was only known to be involved in the degradation of membrane proteins that had already been cleaved by other enzymes.  BCMA is the first natural substrate of gamma-secretase to be identified that is directly cleaved by the enzyme,  says Meinl,  and probably reflects the fact that the extracellular segment of the receptor is unusually short.  Informative immunological indicator The cleaved fragment is stable, and can be detected in body fluids as soluble BCMA (sBCMA). Analysis of clinical samples from patients with multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus has indicated that the molecule could provide a useful biomarker for autoimmune disease. Lupus is a systemic condition which affects the whole organism. In lupus patients, levels of sBCMA in the blood were found to be abnormally high   and were correlated with the severity of the disease. Multiple sclerosis is an organ-specific disease, which targets the central nervous system.  Correspondingly, in MS patients sBCMA levels were increased specifically in the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain and the spinal cord,  says Meinl.  So, sBCMA is an indicator of the intensity of ongoing immune reactions. sBCMA is therefore well suited to serve as an informative clinical parameter for the assessment of the therapeutic effects of different treatment regimes on plasma cells.  These findings could facilitate the development of optimized and personalized modes of therapy. Both B cells and the BCMA/BAFF/APRIL system constitute promising targets for the treatment of lupus and multiple sclerosis, as blocking their activity could inhibit the production of the autoimmune antibodies. In the case of lupus, an agent directed against BAFF has already been approved for clinical use. Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, it is effective in only a subset of patients. Further clinical studies on agents that target BAFF, APRIL and their receptors are currently underway. In future, sBCMA could be used to measure and optimize the impact not only of these new therapies but also of already proven treatments, since it enables one to monitor the levels of plasma cells.","Published: June 17, 2015"

You hit the brakes. Disaster averted. But how did your eyes detect that movement? It s a question that has confounded scientists. Now, studying mice, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have an answer: A neural circuit in the retina at the back of the eye carries signals that enable the eye to detect movement. The finding could help in efforts to build artificial retinas for people who have suffered vision loss. The research is published in the online journal eLife. The research team identified specific cell types that form a neural circuit to carry signals from the eye s photoreceptors the rods and cones that sense light to the brain s visual cortex, where those signals are translated into an image.  This ability to detect motion is key for animals, allowing them to detect the presence of predators,  said principal investigator Daniel Kerschensteiner, MD, an assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences.  And we know that these same cells are found not only in mice but in rabbits, cats, primates and likely humans, too. The cells look similar in every species, and we would assume they function in a similar manner as well.  Studying the neural circuit, Tahnbee Kim, a graduate student in Kerschensteiner s lab, identified a specific type of cell called an amacrine cell that s key to detecting motion. Amacrine cells are thought to inhibit, or tamp down, the activity of other cells called ganglion cells. This process ensures that the brain doesn t receive too much visual information, which could distort an image. Using a technique that combines a powerful microscope with a method that allows researchers to track how often retinal cells fire, the researchers also showed that when there is motion in the visual field, a specific subtype of amacrine cell excites ganglion cells, signaling the brain so it becomes aware that an object is moving. The discovery that this type of cell transmits object-motion signals is an important step in understanding how the eye senses motion. It also provides a high level of detail that will be needed to design computerized, artificial retinas, which will need to detect motion as well as sense light.  There are many elements in the retinal circuitry that we haven t figured out yet,  said Kerschensteiner, also an assistant professor of anatomy and neurobiology.  We know the signals from the rods and cones are transmitted to the retina   where the amacrine and ganglion cells are located   and that s really where the  magic  happens that allows us to see what we see. Unfortunately, we still have a very limited understanding of what most of the cells in the inner retina actually do.

While organ cells, for example, can function in isolation, brain cells require synapses, or connectors, between cells and between regions of the brain. In a new study published in Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, researchers report successfully growing multiple brain structures and forming connections between them in vitro, in a single culture vessel, for the first time. ""We have developed a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based system for producing connections between neurons from two brain regions, the neocortex and midbrain,"" explained lead investigator Chun-Ting Lee, PhD, working in the laboratory of William J. Freed, PhD, of the Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD. Mesencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) neurons and their connections to other neurons in the brain are believed to be related to disorders including drug abuse, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and perhaps eating disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. However, studying mDA neurons and neocortical neurons in isolation does not reveal much data about how these cells actually interact in these conditions. This new capability to grow and interconnect two types of neurons in vitro now provides researchers with an excellent model for further study. ""This method, therefore, has the potential to expand the potential of hPSC-derived neurons to allow for studies of human neural systems and interconnections that have previously not been possible to model in vitro,"" commented Dr. Lee. Using a special container called an ""ibidi wound healing dish,"" which contains two chambers separated by a removable barrier, the researchers used hPSC to grow mDA neurons and neocortical neurons in the two individual chambers. The barrier was removed after colonies of both types of cells had formed and further growth resulted in the formation of synapses between neurons from each colony. Future experiments could employ modifications of this method to examine connections between any two brain regions or neuronal subtypes that can be produced from hPSCs in vitro.

Individual DNA bases can be chemically modified, with significant functional consequences. In the bacterial kingdom, the most prevalent base modifications are in the form of DNA methylations, specifically to adenine and cytosine residuals. Beyond their participation in host defense, increasing evidence suggests that these modifications also play important roles in the regulation of gene expression, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. The research team employed the PacBio  RS II system, which can collect data on base modifications simultaneously as it collects DNA sequence data. The instrument s single molecule, real-time sequencing enables the detection of N6-methyladenine and 4-methylcytosine, two major types of DNA modifications comprising the bacterial methylome. However, existing methods for studying bacterial methylomes rely on a population-level consensus that lack the single-cell resolution required to observe epigenetic heterogeneity.  We created a technique for the detection and phasing of DNA methylation at the single molecule level. We found that a typical clonal bacterial population that would otherwise be considered homogeneous using conventional techniques has epigenetically distinct subpopulations with different gene expression patterns"" said Gang Fang, Ph.D., assistant professor of genetics and genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and senior author of the study.  Given that phenotypic heterogeneity within a bacterial population can increase its advantage of survival under stress conditions such as antibiotic treatment, this new technique is quite promising for future treatment of bacterial pathogens, as it enables de novo detection and characterization of epigenetic heterogeneity in a bacterial population.  The researchers studied seven bacterial strains, demonstrating the new technique reveals distinct types of epigenetic heterogeneity. For Helicobacter pylori, a pathogenic bacterium that colonizes over 40% of the world population and is associated with gastric cancer, the team discovered that epigenetic heterogeneity can quickly emerge as a single cell divides, and different subpopulations with distinct methylation patterns have distinct gene expressions patterns. This may have contributed to the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori.  The application of this new technique will enable a more comprehensive characterization of the functions of DNA methylation and their impact on bacterial physiology.  Resolving nucleotide modifications at the single molecule, single nucleotide level, especially when integrated with other single molecule- or single cell-level data, such as RNA and protein expression, will help resolve regulatory relationships that govern higher order phenotypes such as drug resistance,"" said Eric Schadt, Ph.D., founding director of the Icahn Institute and professor of genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  The approach we developed can also be used to analyze DNA viruses and human mitochondrial DNA, both of which present significant epigenetic heterogeneity. ","Published: June 16, 2015"

The research focuses on the fruit flyRhagoletis pomonella, aka the  apple maggot,  a North American native that lays its eggs inside the fruit of the hawthorn tree. In the 1850s, a splinter group of Rhagoletis began laying eggs in apples in upstate New York, a move that required the flies to adapt the timing of their annual egg-laying cycle to match the fruiting time of their new hosts.  Today, there are two forms of Rhagoletis pomonella in the U.S., the ancestral form that times its life cycle to the hawthorn tree and a derived form that is timed to apple trees, which fruit about three to four weeks earlier,  said study lead author Scott Egan, an evolutionary biologist in the Dept. of BioSciences at Rice.  These two forms have evolved very distinct differences and are on the path to evolving into two new species, and because they have a single generation per year, we know that all of the differences between the two has happened in no more than 170 generations.  The two populations are also known to interbreed. In a given year, about 5% move between populations. For Egan and other biologists who specialize in studying the process of speciation, continued  gene flow  between the divergent populations raises significant questions about whether and how R. pomonella may eventually evolve into two species.  According to theory, this amount of gene flow should be enough to counteract the processes of divergent selection that are driving the populations apart,  Egan said.  However, if natural selection is strong, and the impacts of selection are genome-wide, the two might diverge even in the face of this much continued gene flow.  To get a sense of how quickly the two populations diverged genetically, Egan and colleagues from Notre Dame, the Univ. of Sheffield in Great Britain, the Univ. of Florida and Kansas State Univ. conducted the most extensive genetic analysis of R. pomonella yet undertaken. Borrowing a page from criminal forensics, the team applied the latest tools of genomic science to experimental samples that had been preserved in a freezer at the lab of Notre Dame biologist Jeffrey Feder since the mid-1990s. At the time of the initial experiment, genetic technology only allowed Feder and colleagues to study a handful of changes across the genome.  We collected flies from native hawthorn trees, divided the flies into two groups and raised the flies under haw- and apple-like conditions in the lab,  Feder said. By raising the ancestral population under both conditions, Feder and colleagues experimentally replicated the host shift observed in New York in the 1850s. In 2012, Egan and colleagues sequenced a portion of the genome for individuals from the earlier lab experiment and measured the differences between individuals that had been raised under haw- versus apple-like conditions. The team compiled a database of more than 5 billion nucleotide base pairs to examine the genetic differences between all the populations. Of particular interest were the sites across the genome where the DNA sequences differed from one population to the other at a single site. This type of genetic variation within a species is called a polymorphism, and  single nucleotide polymorphisms,  or SNPs, are the smallest unit of polymorphic variation.  For the ancestral flies that had been raised for one generation on the apple cycle, we documented changes in more than 32,000 SNPs,  Egan said.  Overall, we found that the genetic changes undergone by this first generation accounted for up to 70 percent of all the genetic changes that had occurred between the two populations since the 1850s.  Kansas State Univ. s Greg Ragland, co-lead author of the study, said,  The changes observed in both experimental and natural populations of R. pomonella underscore the importance of ecological selection at early stages of divergence and call for further integration of studies of speciation and genome divergence.  For example, when the team compared the genetic changes from the  selection experiment  with the genome-wide differences between apple and haw populations in nature, they found striking similarities. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of the 32,000 SNPs were similar to the observed differences between the ancestral and divergent populations in nature.  By combining genomic data from experimental and natural populations, we were able to quantify the total genome-wide impact of selection,  Feder said. He said the effects are widespread across the R. pomonella genome because in addition to direct effects on genes that underlie important traits, there were also indirect effects in which changes in one gene prompted changes elsewhere through a process called  linkage disequilibrium.  Egan said previous research on R. pomonella provided other clues as to why the genetic shift was so widespread. For example, the traits that were under selection in the move between host plants involved many genes. In addition, R. pomonella has high levels of within-population genetic variation upon which selection easily acts. And finally, R. pomonella is more susceptible to the impact of divergent natural selection because its genome contains several  inversion areas,  regions where DNA sequences are broken and realigned in the opposite order, which increases linkage disequilibrium and the total impact of selection.","Published: June 16, 2015"

""The unusual ribosomes, the small genomes   between 600 and 1,100 genes   the inability to synthesize amino acids and nucleotides, and a consistent metabolic story really connects these bacteria together in a pretty surprising way,"" Christopher Brown, a graduate student in the University of California at Berkeley plant and microbial biology, said in a statement. Brown is first author on the paper that describes the microbes and methods used to detect them. He is a graduate student working with senior author Jillian Banfield, an earth sciences researcher affiliated with UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Brown, Banfield, and colleagues did shotgun metagenomic sequencing on samples collected at a groundwater bioremediation site in Rifle, Colorado in 2011. With these sequences, they detected DNA from 35 previously unknown bacterial phyla, which fell into a new branch of the microbial tree characterized by organisms with compact genomes and bizarre biology. Together, this so-called candidate phyla radiation (CPR) appears to account for an estimated 15 percent of all bacteria found on Earth, according to the team's calculations, suggesting bacterial lifestyles may be far broader than previously appreciated. For the study, collaborators at LBNL used Illumina HiSeq instruments to sequence DNA and RNA from a dozen groundwater samples, focusing on microbes that could slip through fine, 0.2-micron filters used to purify the water. From the hundreds of billions of bases of metagenome and metatranscriptome sequences produced, the team narrowed in on groups of bacterial sequence that corresponded with 789 draft genomes for bacteria with CPR-like features. The researchers also went on to assemble eight complete bacterial genomes from the available sequence data, representing one known and four new bacterial phyla. As a group, the newly detected phyla typically contained around half of the predicted protein-coding genes described in bacteria in the past. And they had other strange features, too. For instance, researchers found that introns often intersected parts of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence in these bugs, which would make them tricky to see with the 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach that's often used to tally up the species composition in a microbial community. Indeed, the team suspects that anywhere from half to all of the organisms in each of the new phyla would be missed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The newfound microbes also contained several other peculiar ribosome features, with many lacking proteins that are widespread across all other known bacteria, Banfield noted. Moreover, bacteria from the new phyla were frequently missing machinery used to produce amino acids or nucleotide bases, suggesting they may rely on other organisms for such functions. The team has tacked monikers onto more than 20 of the new bacteria phyla, including one dubbed Berkelbacteria after the home institution of researchers leading the study. Based on the estimated size of the bacterial family tree and the prevalence of the CPR bacteria found in the current study, the researchers suspect there may be 250 or more CPR phyla.","Published: June 16, 2015"

Our computer program can comb through the genetic information from a specific cell type and predict which  dimmer switch  mutations are most likely to alter the cell s gene activity, and therefore its function,  says Michael Beer, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  The plan is to continually improve the formula as we learn more about these regulatory regions,  says Beer,  but already it can narrow down a list of disease-associated mutations by a factor of 20, allowing researchers to focus on the ones that are most likely to matter.  Researchers around the world have sequenced the genomes of many patients suffering from common multigene diseases, looking for shared mutations in their control regions. The trouble is, Beer says, that these studies yield hundreds of mutations, most of which are benign. So he and his team of researchers set out to design a computer program that could learn the difference between mutations that are likely to affect gene activity levels and those that likely won't.  There are a lot of common diseases, like diabetes, that are probably the result of several different mutations in control regions. The mutations don't directly cause a change in the proteins made, but they impact their abundance,  he says, and sorting out which ones matter most in diseases is key to advancing treatments. The task has been difficult, Beer says, because not all mutations are created equal. A single alteration, say from a cysteine (C) to a guanine (G) in the four-letter alphabet of DNA, will have drastically different effects based on where it occurs in the genome, he explains.  If it occurs in the middle of a gene that encodes a crucial protein, it could alter the code in such a way that no protein is made and the organism dies, or it could have no affect whatsoever if the function of the protein isn t altered by the change,  he says. The same extremes could be true if the C to G mutation occurred outside of a gene, in a control region: The mutation could cause the region to stop working altogether, or it could have no effect. And between those extremes is everything else. To develop the new formula, Beer says his team first  trained  its computer program to recognize potential control regions using a property called DNase sensitivity. DNase is an enzyme that cuts DNA wherever it is not tightly wound. The openness of particular sequences of DNA varies among different types of cells, and only control regions in open DNA can be active. How vulnerable certain stretches of DNA are to DNAse is therefore an indication of which control regions are important in a given cell type, Beer says. Dongwon Lee, Ph.D., then a graduate student in Beer s laboratory, taught the computer program to recognize the features of DNase-sensitive sequences in a type of cancer cell by giving the computer a list of already known sequences. It then predicted the rest of the DNase-sensitive sequences and measured how much individual sections of a sequence contributed to that region s overall DNase sensitivity. The computer then simulated  mutating  every DNA letter in turn and recalculated each section s contribution to DNase sensitivity. The larger the change in sensitivity after a given mutation, the more likely it is that that mutation will affect gene activity levels in the cell, Beer says. To test the validity of the formula, the team compared their computer predictions to the predictions made by alternative programs. When the programs   rules  were set to be equally thorough in their searches, Beer s program was 56 percent accurate   10 times more accurate than the next best program. To further directly test the formula, Beer worked with Andrew McCallion, Ph.D., an associate professor at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, to predict the impact of mutations in the control regions for two pigment-related genes in mouse melanocytes (skin pigment cells). They then selected 40 mutations with different levels of predicted impact and tested their effect in melanocytes grown in the laboratory. When they measured the activity levels of the two genes, they found that there was a strong correlation between the program s prediction and the actual change experienced by the cells.   My group has been working for over a decade to shed some light on the nature of regulatory mutations in common disease,  McCallion says.  The synergy of our careers and our strategies bring the Beer group and mine to an exciting place in this effort. By training the computer program with the right cellular material, we can now predict the consequences of previously undecipherable regulatory sequence mutations.  Beer and his team repeated this targeted testing of their formula in mouse and human liver cells and in human leukemia cells, with similar results. They also tested their formula on three control region mutations already known to affect cholesterol levels, hemoglobin levels and prostate cancer. Again they found that these mutations drew higher computer scores than other mutations in the same control regions. Finally, the team examined the control regions for T helper cells, a type of immune cell that can contribute to autoimmune diseases when its genes become disregulated. Their calculations identified 15 different control region mutations associated with nine different immune system disorders, from allergies to multiple sclerosis and Crohn s disease. Importantly, Beer says, previous studies had associated nine of the same control regions with immune disorders, but they had not been able to hone in on the exact mutation that mattered. Beer says:  The next step is to collect cells from patients with these autoimmune diseases, test their gene activity levels and find out if our predictions were right. If so, it should help us determine how the activity is being perturbed and how we can fix it.  The same process can theoretically be repeated on many other diseases, providing timesaving insights for each.","Published: June 16, 2015"

According to the scientists, the results could supply approaches to new therapies in the area of asthma and allergies. The team headed by Dr. Kathrin Suttner, who, together with Prof. Dr. Carsten Schmidt-Weber, heads the airway immunology research group at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and Technische Universit t M nchen, concentrated its work on the so-called naive CD4+ T cells. They are a precursor form of T cells and form the basis for immunological memory*. Impaired development of these cells can influence the entire immune system and lead to illnesses such as allergies and asthma. Protein atlas on T cell precursors The scientists specifically examined proteins on the surface of the naive CD4+ T cells because these proteins play an important role in the cell development and mediate the corresponding responses to stimuli from the environment. Using mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analysis in close cooperation with the Core Facility Proteomics of the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Department of the Technische Universit t M nchen, the researchers succeeded in precisely identifying a multitude of surface proteins. They also compared the compositions in the early and late activation forms of the cells. ""We can understand the results as an atlas for surface proteins. The findings also presented proteins for the first time that had never been known to be associated with T cells or their maturation process,"" explains Anke Gr ssel, first author of the study. The researchers are planning further investigations in the future in order to explain the exact role of these proteins. ""We want to contribute to identifying new targets of attack that could serve as a basis for the development of therapeutic or diagnostic approaches,"" explains group leader Suttner. The researchers find the surface proteins of the naive CD4+ T cells to be particularly attractive primarily because their access is relatively simple.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hiv-paradox-196957,HIV Paradox Investigators from Harvard Medical School  Massachusetts General Hospital  and the Ragon Institute of MGH  MIT and Harvard have added another piece to the puzzle of how a small group of individuals known as elite controllers are able to control HIV infection without drug treatment   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The research team reports finding that dendritic cells of elite controllers are better able to detect the presence of HIV paradoxically through a greater susceptibility to HIV infection which enables them to stimulate the generation of T cells specifically targeting the virus.   It s been recognized for a while that these individuals have stronger T-cell immune responses against HIV than other patients, but the reason for that has been unknown,  said Xu Yu, HMS associate professor of medicine at Mass General and corresponding author of the paper.  We have shown that dendritic cells, which play a critical role in generating virus-specific T cells, have an improved ability to recognize HIV and build effective immune responses in elite controllers.  Part of the innate immune system that is the body s first line defense against infection, dendritic cells sense the presence of pathogens in the blood or other tissues, ingest infecting organisms and then display fragments of the invaders on their surface, which alerts and activates both killer and helper T cells (CD4 and CD8 cells), essentially teaching them to target the specific pathogen.  Because of this critical role of dendritic cells, the investigators explored the hypothesis that dendritic cells of elite controllers were better able to sense HIV and, as a result, better able to generate virus-specific T-cell responses. When HIV infects a cell, it first injects its genetic material RNA in this case into the cell along with the reverse transcriptase enzyme that transcribes the single-strand RNA molecule into a double-stranded DNA molecule. After HIV DNA enters the nucleus of an infected cell, it becomes integrated into the cellular DNA, turning it into an HIV factory that generates more virus particles.  In experiments using dendritic cells from elite controllers, from patients with progressing HIV infection, and cells from uninfected individuals, the investigators found a surprising difference. In most people, HIV infection of dendritic cells appears to be blocked at an early stage, resulting in a lack of HIV DNA and limited viral replication within those cells. While this may seem beneficial, it actually works more to the benefit of the virus than the infected individual by allowing HIV to escape recognition by dendritic cells.  The dendritic cells of elite controllers, however, were found to contain higher levels of HIV DNA, probably because of limited expression of a protein called SAMDH1 that usually blocks reverse transcription in several types of immune cells. The dendritic cells of elite controllers also appear to produce higher levels of a DNA-sensing protein called cGAS that recognizes the presence of HIV and induces rapid expression of type 1 interferons. This contributes to the generation of the more powerful T-cell responses against HIV that are typically observed in elite controllers.  We are now focusing on fully understanding all the components required to trigger appropriate activation of dendritic cells in HIV infection, which may help to induce an elite-controller-like, drug-free remission of HIV in a broader patient population,  Yu explained.

The intravenous formulation of MGB-BP-3 is currently in late stage pre-clinical development, where it is being assessed in a number of models for tolerability and efficacy against specific Gram-positive bacteria, which can cause many of the most common hospital-acquired infections. The foci of these proof of concept studies have been methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. MGB-BP-3 has been successfully lyophilized, forming a freeze-dried formulation that is suitable for IV administration in aqueous solution. MGB-BP-3 is a truly novel antibiotic which has been shown to be active against a broad range of important multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The Company has made significant progress in developing an oral formulation of MGB-BP-3 for the treatment of Clostridium difficile that is due to begin a Phase I clinical study in the coming weeks. Today s announcement comes at a critical time for the antibiotic industry, in light of the latest report from the O Neill Review on Antibiotic Resistance (14th May 2015), which highlighted the human and financial costs that society faces as a result of antibiotic resistant infections, one of the world s most pressing global healthcare problems. Miroslav Ravic, CEO of MGB Biopharma, said:  The development of this new IV formulation is a fantastic breakthrough for MGB. I would like to congratulate all of the team who were responsible for making this possible. With this new formulation we can increase the utility of MGB-BP-3 significantly as it could allow us to provide clinicians with a truly novel antibiotic to treat the multiple resistant systemic Gram-positive infections that cause many deaths and higher morbidity in patients being treated in hospital.   The figures highlighted in Jim O Neill s report - and in particular the potential human cost of not addressing antibiotic resistance - are significant. There is a clear need for novel and differentiated products to tackle the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Treatment with BL-8040 as a single agent was found safe and well tolerated at all doses, and resulted in efficient stem-cell mobilization and collection in all study participants. Furthermore, the results support BL-8040 as a one-day, single-dose collection regimen, which is a significant improvement compared to the current standard of care. The full Phase 1 data set was presented in an oral presentation at the 20th Annual Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) in Vienna, Austria. Robust stem-cell mobilization was evident in all treated participants across the different doses tested, leading to a median 9.5-fold increase of stem cells in the peripheral blood following a single BL-8040 treatment. Two to four hours after a single administration, BL-8040 enabled collection of a stem-cell yield exceeding the number of cells required to support a transplant in all treated participants, following only one collection procedure. These results support a novel approach to stem-cell collection for transplantation purposes in patients with hematological malignancies or other indications. Importantly, the collection of CD34+ cells was accompanied by mobilization and collection of colony-forming cells, as well as T, B and NK cells. The collected human graft was further assessed for its viability and quality in vitro and in vivo. The cells collected from the subjects treated with BL-8040 showed excellent engraftment in irradiated mice, followed by a rapid reconstitution of normal hematopoiesis. The Phase 1 clinical trial was performed on healthy volunteers and consisted of two parts. The first part of the study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in three cohorts of eight participants each, with each participant receiving two consecutive injections of BL-8040. Results show that BL-8040 is safe and well tolerated up to a dose of 1 mg/kg, and that dramatic mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) was observed across all doses tested. The robust mobilization supports the further use of a single injection of BL-8040 for HSPC collection. In the second part of the Phase 1 study, eight healthy participants received a single injection of BL-8040 at the highest dose of 1 mg/kg, and four hours later underwent a single, standard leukapheresis procedure. Robust and rapid stem-cell mobilization was evident in all treated participants, supporting a novel approach to stem-cell collection. The median level of collected stem cells was higher than 11 x 106 cells per kg, and the level of HPSCs in the peripheral blood circulation 24 hours after injection of BL-8040 enabled an additional apheresis on Day 2, if needed. These data support the use of BL-8040 as a single-agent, single-injection, one-day regimen for the collection of stem cells.  We are very happy to report these outstanding results supporting BL-8040 as an effective one-day monotherapy for collection of sufficient stem cells for hematopoietic cell transplantation. This is a major improvement over currently available procedures, which are lengthier and sometimes require the combination of several agents and multiple time-consuming apheresis sessions. Moreover, we see an improvement in composition of the collected cells, suggesting the potential of a better quality graft that may improve stem cell transplantation outcomes,  said Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx.  We intend to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to discuss our next steps in the clinical development program for this indication, including the design of the planned follow-up Phase 2 study. In addition, we are looking forward to reporting top-line results from the on-going Phase 2 study of BL-8040 for treating relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients, which we expect in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also look forward to initiating clinical studies for BL-8040 in three additional indications over the next few months, thus expanding and enhancing the potential of our oncology platform.  At the same conference, the Company also presented positive preclinical results for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at a poster session. The results show that BL-8040 rapidly and efficiently induces cell death of AML cells, and demonstrates for the first time that CXCR4 inhibition is associated with induction of terminal differentiation of AML cells.","Published: June 16, 2015"

Circadian rhythms, which oscillate over a roughly 24-hour cycle in adaptation to the Earth's rotation, have been observed in most of the planet's plants, animals, fungi and cyanobacteria, and are responsible for regulating many aspects of organisms' physiological, behavioral and metabolic functions. Now, scientists led by the pioneering Harvard synthetic biologist Pamela Silver, Ph.D., have harnessed the circadian mechanism found in cyanobacteria to transplant the circadian wiring into a common species of bacteria that is naturally non circadian. The novel work, which for the first time demonstrates the transplant of a circadian rhythm, is reported in a new study in Science Advances. ""By looking at systems in nature as modular, we think like engineers to manipulate and use biological circuits in a predictable, programmable way,"" said Silver, who is a Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and a Professor in the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. Silver's team used this methodology to successfully transplant a circadian rhythm into the bacterial species E. coli, which is widely used as a ""workhorse"" cell species by biologists due to how well it is understood and the ease in which E. coli can be genetically altered. The genetically engineered circadian E. coli designed by Silver could one day be used in probiotic pills as a way to monitor the gut microbiota, which is the collective and diverse set of bacterial species that flourish in the human gastrointestinal tract and contribute to many different health factors. To create a circadian rhythm in E. coli, the protein circuit responsible for regulating circadian oscillations was modularly removed from cyanobacteria, a photosynthetic bacteria species that is the only bacteria known to naturally contain a circadian rhythm. The protein circuit was then transplanted into E. coli, where it can be connected to additional gene expression components to potentially influence metabolic and behavioral functions in programmable relation to the day night cycle. In the experimental E. coli, the circuit was linked to fluorescent proteins that lit up each time the circadian oscillations were triggered, causing the E. coli to glow rhythmically in a stunning visual confirmation of the transplant's success. ""The ultimate dream application would be to deliver these circadian E. coli to an individual in pill form, which could allow the circadian rhythm to be linked to additional biological circuits in order to perform a precisely timed release of drugs, or to be able to sense and influence the host's circadian rhythm,"" said the study's first author, Anna Chen, a systems biology graduate student at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Medical School. The human circadian rhythm has been shown to impact metabolism, which when disturbed can contribute to obesity and glucose intolerance. What's more, many drugs including those commonly used to treat various cancers have been shown to fluctuate in their efficacy based on the time of day and the point in a patient's circadian cycle in which they are administered. Using circadian E. coli, therapeutic strategies to influence a patient's circadian rhythm or to program drugs to release internally at a specific point in the patient's circadian rhythm could therefore energize treatments for cancer and metabolic diseases, among other clinical applications.

Aleksanteri Aspelund and colleagues discovered the meningeal linings of brain have a lymphatic vessel network that has direct connections to the systemic lymphatic network elsewhere in the body. Lymphatic circulation forms a network that covers almost the whole body and is especially important to the tissue clearance of fluids and macromolecules as well as for immune defense mechanisms. Until now, the central nervous system has been considered an immune-privileged organ devoid of lymphatic vasculature. ""We have recently discovered that in the eye, which is another immune-privileged organ previously considered to lack lymphatic circulation, there exists a lymphatic-like vessel that is important for the regulation of eye pressure. This led me to reinvestigate the brain in this regard,"" says Aleksanteri Aspelund, who is working in Academy Professor Kari Alitalo's research group. ""We were stunned to find such an extensive network in connection to the brain. This incredible finding completely changes our understanding of how to brain is cleared of excess fluid and gives a chance to look at brain diseases from a completely new angle,"" he continues. The researchers performed a thorough job in characterizing the structure and function of these previously unknown vessels. They showed that these meningeal lymphatic vessels drain out of the skull alongside arteries, veins and cranial nerves. These vessels show all molecular hallmarks of the lymphatic vessels and function as a direct clearance routes for the brain and cerebrospinal fluid macromolecules out of the skull and into the deep cervical lymph nodes. How did the lymphatic vessels manage to escape notice until now? ""This is no wonder,"" says medical student Salli Antila, who has also been working with the project. Lymphatic vessels are collapsed structures between the meninges, and if one does not know how to look, they cannot be found. Although we had already found the vessels, it took some time to develop good imaging methods to visualize these vessels. The discovery has raised several new questions concerning some fundamental brain functions and the mechanisms of brain diseases. Researchers find it highly possible that lymphatic clearance of the brain proves to be important in neuro-immunological diseases as well as in diseases characterized by the pathological accumulation of misfolded proteins or fluid into the brain parenchyma, for example in Alzheimer's disease, which affects tens of millions of people worldwide.

Understanding how dendritic cells are created will aid scientists in finding ways to boost the immune response to infections or dampen it in autoimmune diseases such aslupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Dr Florent Ginhoux, Dr Andreas Schlitzer and colleagues from the Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), a research institute under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore, together with Dr Shalin Naikand Mr Jaring Schreuder from Melbourne s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, discovered each subtype of dendritic cell had its own, unique parent cell.  Dr Naik from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute said dendritic cells were the  James Bond  of the immune system.  Dendritic cells are the intelligence-gathering cells that educate the immune system,  he said.  They tell the infection-fighting T cells and NK cells what a virus, bacterium, fungus or cancer looks like so they know what they re looking for when fighting disease.  If we learn how to control dendritic cells, we could strengthen our immune response to infection when needed, or weaken the action of certain immune cells that attack the body s own tissues in autoimmune disease.  Researchers at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute have made significant contributions to understanding dendritic cell biology for more than 40 years. Previous research from the institute revealed there are different subtypes of dendritic cells, each primed to recognise certain types of infections. Institute researchers also uncovered the parents (called progenitors) that produce dendritic cells. Dr Florent Ginhoux, senior principal investigator at SIgN and lead scientist of the study, said previous research had examined thousands of cells at once.  In this study, we used the latest technologies to examine individual immune cells and their  daughter  cells, revealing there isn t one single parent cell for all subtypes of dendritic cells, but instead a unique progenitor for each individual subtype.  Targeting progenitor cells could make treatments more efficient, Dr Ginhoux said.  One progenitor cell can produce multiple daughter cells,  he said.  Suppressing a progenitor from creating the subtype of dendritic cells implicated in causing lupus, for example, could be an efficient way of treating autoimmune diseases while minimising the impact on the rest of the immune system.  Similarly, triggering extra production of particular dendritic cells could improve the immune response to infections or vaccines. This discovery will enable scientists to find ways of tweaking our immune response with much greater accuracy and precision than ever before.  Mapping the blood cell family tree would help to understand what goes wrong when disease occurs, Dr Naik said.  Every blood and immune cell in our body descends from blood stem cells,  he said.  We and others have been following this family tree from one daughter cell to the next to discover how each cell type is created and how the parent cell  decides  if it should make more of itself or create the next cell type. By dissecting the heritage of these cells, we can find new targets to tackle a range of conditions including infectious diseases, cancers and immune disorders, and even make vaccines more effective.

""This is the first demonstration of the additive function of fragile X proteins in neuronal development,"" says study corresponding author and Waisman Center and Department of Neuroscience Professor Xinyu Zhao. Relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to the cognitive and learning deficits in fragile X syndrome, Zhao says, making it difficult to devise effective therapies. She studies the two fragile X proteins, FMRP and FXR2P, because doing so could yield new information that ultimately leads to treatment for fragile X and other disorders marked by defects in neuronal development, like autism and schizophrenia. For instance, while FXR2P has been shown to be important in autism, the function of the protein and its contribution to fragile X syndrome has been unclear, Zhao says. Fragile X is a genetic condition that affects one in 4,000 males and one in 8,000 females. It's linked to a mutation in the gene that makes the FMRP protein, located on the X chromosome. Up to a third of people with fragile X also have autism. Children with the syndrome are more prone to attention deficit disorder and a diagnosis on the autism spectrum; display physical features such as flat feet, a prominent jaw and forehead, and a long and narrow face; and may have anxiety. Additionally, an estimated one in 250 women and one in 500 men carry a ""premutation"" on the gene that makes FMRP protein, which renders the gene unstable. Carriers can pass it on to future generations and are at greater risk for a Parkinson's disease-like disorder called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. They may also be more prone to stress and other challenges. In a previous study, Zhao's team showed that both FMRP and FXR2P are integral for new neuron production in adult mice and are important for learning and cognition. In the current study, the research team looked at the function of the proteins in the maturation of newly formed adult neurons. The researchers found that mice lacking the FXR2P protein had impaired performance in learning and memory tasks. Using techniques to study newly formed neurons in the brain, the team also found these mice had neurons that did not mature properly. The neurons were also less well connected to other neurons that form important circuits in the brain compared to mice with the protein. The team also highlighted a new interaction between the FXR2P protein and a specific neuronal receptor, a protein charged with receiving messages and passing along information, and showed that the two work together for proper neuronal development. Additionally, it revealed that FXR2P and FMRP work together in regulating this receptor's activity and the maturation of neurons. ""The findings suggest that fostering new nerve cell development during the postnatal period may have therapeutic potential for people with fragile X syndrome and other neurological disorders,"" says Zhao. Her research group will continue to study these proteins and the role they play in neural development and fragile X syndrome   work that's likely to influence other fields of inquiry in autism and beyond. The lab will also work toward translating the findings in mice into human therapies. It is far more challenging to study brain development in people, so mice serve as a model for these studies.  ""If we can find a way to reactivate the FMRP gene, we may be able to treat the disease,"" says Zhao.","Published: June 15, 2015"

This new drug modality culminates a decade of work in the field by my lab,  said Craig Crews, the Lewis B. Cullman Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and senior author of the paper, which was done in collaboration with scientists from GlaxoSmithKline and Arvinas, LLC. Almost all current drugs are small molecules designed to fit into the folds of disease-causing proteins and inhibit their function. High doses are often needed to ensure that protein function is blocked sufficiently to produce therapeutic results, which in turn can produce harmful side effects. In contrast, PROTACs engage the cells  own protein degradation machinery to destroy targeted proteins by tagging them for removal and can do so multiple times, meaning it can work at  lower doses, the authors say. This suggests this new type of drug has not only the potential to target proteins that are not currently  pharmaceutically vulnerable  but could do so safely, Crews said.  This is a game-changer for drug development,  Crews said. The PROTAC technology is being commercialized by New Haven biotechnology company Arvinas, LLC, which recently signed a $434 million partnership from pharmaceutical giant Merck to further explore the potential of the PROTAC technology.

This is especially worrisome given the need to increase, not just maintain, crop yields to feed the increasing global population. Over the course of evolution, plants have developed mechanisms to adapt to periods of inadequate water, and as any gardener can tell you, some species are better able to handle drought than others. Accordingly, scientists have invested much effort to understand how plants respond to drought stress and what can be done to increase the drought tolerance of economically important plants. As Dr. Nam-Chon Paek of Seoul National University in Korea stated, 'We all expect that drought will be the major challenge for crop production in the near future. Understanding drought-responsive signaling and the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of drought tolerance in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice provide new insight into how to develop drought-tolerant crop plants through conventional breeding or biotechnological approaches.' Arabidopsis thaliana was the first plant to have its genome sequenced. Paek is the senior author of a paper to be published this week in The Plant Cell that takes advantage of the genetic resources in this model species to reveal important underpinnings of drought responses in plants. Paek's research group analyzed plants mutated in a regulatory gene called NAC016 and found that the nac016 mutant plants were more resistant to drought. The researchers set out to understand how this drought tolerance came about by comparing the set of expressed genes (the transcriptome) in the mutants to that in normal (so-called wild-type) plants. According to Paek, 'Genome-wide transcriptome analysis using drought-tolerant or -susceptible variants is a promising method to reach the goal of understanding drought tolerance'. In this case, the scientists discovered that NAC016 is part of a mechanism to turn off responses to drought. This is important because in the wild, plants likely evolved to keep the drought-response pathways inactive until needed so that they could save the energy the responses would require. For agricultural purposes, though, the ability to control when the pathway is on would be a great boon to developing drought-tolerant crops.","Published: June 15, 2015"

Led by Shigeki Miyamoto, a professor of oncology at UW-Madison, and David Beebe, the John D. MacArthur Professor and Claude Bernard professor of biomedical engineering at UW-Madison.  ""We're taking the first steps toward mimicking the body in a dish,"" Beebe says. Much of the research was led by Chorom Pak, who previously was a graduate student working in Miyamoto's lab. Pak and Edmond Young (now at the University of Toronto) and the other researchers produced an assay, or testing process, which involves co-culturing multiple myeloma tumor cells with their surrounding nontumor cells, all from the same patient, in a microscale petri dish. The researchers then treated the tumor cells with bortezomib, a drug commonly used in multiple myeloma therapy. And after only three days, the researchers could determine whether the drug was effective   or not. They compared the results of their ex vivo tests with the success or failure rates of actual patients who had received the drug   and an unprecedented 100 percent of the ex vivo test results matched the results of the patients. Multiple myeloma is a universally fatal cancer. Rising in the blood marrow due to an accumulation of abnormal, or cancerous, plasma cells, myeloma is treatable but incurable. ""The median survival rate has improved, but is only about five to seven years,"" Pak says. The new assay could save many multiple myeloma cancer patients the psychological stress of having to try multiple drugs until they find the most effective one. The assay reduces clinicians' need for this trial-and-error approach while treating a patient, and it also lowers the cost of treatment. The fundamental idea behind the research was to focus on everything surrounding a tumor, not just the tumor itself. These surroundings can include bone marrow stromal cells, macrophages and other immune cells, all of which represent an integral part of the tumor's environment. By including these components in a microfluidic petri dish   a device developed by Beebe and Miyamoto's lab a few years ago   the researchers' ability to accurately gauge results increased dramatically. Beebe says scaling down the testing environment in the group's research is akin to moving from a lake to a bathtub: While the huge area of a standard-sized petri dish dilutes all the extra cells, the microscale petri dish the team used allows cancer cells to continue interacting with their usual surroundings, but outside of the body. The researchers essentially created a miniaturized external model of an individual's cancer, says Pak. She has founded a service-based company called Lynx Biosciences based on these findings, and the company was recently a finalist in the 2015 Wisconsin Governor's Business Plan Contest. Pak and fellow researchers are looking to conduct a prospective trial, which, instead of simply matching the results of patients with that of the ex vivo tests, will actually use the ex vivo tests to identify responsive and nonresponsive patients. In addition, they are starting to consider what this discovery means for other cancer types and other drugs. The researchers' results could have interesting and wide-ranging implications for the future of cancer treatment and therapy, although their work is far from over. ""This is only one type of cancer, one particular drug, and we're a long way from implementing this and helping patients in a widespread way,"" Beebe says. ""But it's happening. This is an exciting time in this area, and we're definitely going to see more of this.""","Published: June 15, 2015"

The images were made at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) by a powerful 9.4-Tesla MRI, the first of its kind for human imaging. The 9.4 T magnetic field is more than three times stronger than that of a typical MRI machine in a doctor s office and is currently approved only for research. The strongest MRI units approved for clinical use are 3 T.  The information provided by these 9.4-Tesla scans may be very useful in helping us to detect tiny losses of brain cells and the reduction in cell density that characterizes the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases that can take decades to develop before symptoms appear, like Alzheimer s disease,  said Dr. Keith Thulborn, director of MRI research in the UIC College of Medicine and lead author of the report.  If we can identify when Alzheimer s pathology starts, the efficacy of new drugs or other interventions to slow or prevent Alzheimer s disease can be tested and monitored when the disease starts, instead of after it s developed for 20 or 30 years and becomes clinically apparent,  said Thulborn, who is professor of radiology, physiology and biophysics. Neuroscientists have long known that the brain shrinks with age, but for a long time they thought the loss in volume was associated with a loss of brain cells. That was disproven by studies that showed it is the neurons themselves that shrink while the number of cells remains the same in normal older adults. Thulborn and his colleagues scanned the brains of 49 cognitively normal adults ranging in age from 21 to 80. All had at least a college education and were employed or, if retired, were active in their communities. All were without major medical, neurological or psychiatric disease and scored within the normal range for mental status. The 9.4 Tesla MRI measures sodium ions, which are less concentrated by several orders of magnitude than the fat and water molecules detected with standard MRI. Sodium ions are present throughout the body and are pumped in and out of neurons to generate the electric potentials needed to spark nerve impulses. Sodium concentrations in the brain reflect neuron density. Areas of low sodium concentration indicate lots of neurons packed tightly together, while higher sodium concentration can indicate more space between cells   or the loss of cells, as in the case of neurodegenerative diseases. Thulborn thinks the ultra-high-field scanners eventually will be approved for clinical use.  We can use the 9.4 T to look at brain cell loss in real time in patients experiencing stroke, or to see whether chemotherapy for brain tumors is working in higher resolution that is just not available using the current 3 T clinical scanners,  he said.

The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative was launched by President Obama in 2013 and is focused on revolutionizing understanding of the human brain, with the goal of helping researchers uncover the mysteries of such brain disorders as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases, depression, and traumatic brain injury. As part of the initiative, ZEISS has delivered a variety of high performance microscopes and imaging systems. Equipment installed in phase one of the multi-phase project includes ZEISS LSM 880 with Airyscan multiphoton confocal microscope, ZEISS LSM 880 confocal microscope with OPO capabilities, as well as ZEISS Lightsheet Z.1 light sheet imaging system with special optics for cleared tissue samples, and ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 digital slide scanning system. As part of the partnership, ZEISS will provide the latest updates of the equipment, while UC Berkeley researchers will offer feedback on any new or special neurotechnology needs to help ZEISS produce future products best suited for the newest advances in neuroscience research endeavors. The public-private initiative was launched on May 28, 2015 at an event hosted by UC Berkeley. James Sharp, President of ZEISS Microscopy USA, spoke at the event, along with Ehud Isacoff, Director of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, Holly Aaron, Manager of the BrainMIC, Steven Martin, Dean of Biological Sciences and Sharif Taha, Scientific Program Officer at The Kavli Foundation. According to Holly Aaron, the BrainMIC was established as a resource for the neuroscience community, with the goal of overcoming one of the BRAIN Initiative s major challenges   making new tools accessible to the broad community.  There has been a rapid advance in the optical tools available to detect and control neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. These powerful tools are an important and exciting step toward deciphering the neuronal circuits that command essential brain functions, such as perception, movement, and memory. However, for these tools to yield breakthrough discoveries there is a need for commercially available microscopes that are optimized for use with emerging neurotechnologies. ZEISS s participation will help us meet that need.  Sharp added:  I am very excited about the partnership and looking forward to discussions about the types of research UC Berkeley is pursuing and helping researchers use the equipment to its fullest capabilities, while at the same time helping ZEISS to increase our capabilities.

Commenting on the designation, Dr Keith Martin, CEO said:  Following the Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medical Agency last year, we are very pleased to receive designation from the US FDA for ATX-F8-117. These designations emphasize the need for an effective treatment for haemophilia A patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors that occurs in approximately 30 per cent of patients. This results in poor clotting of the blood leading to severe health issues. This orphan drug designation follows extensive pre-clinical evaluation and we look forward to advancing a clinical development programme for this important medical condition.  Haemophilia A is a rare chronic bleeding disorder, which leads to inadequate clotting of the blood in response to any type of injury or surgery. It is a genetic disorder that causes missing or defective Factor VIII, an essential blood-clotting protein. Haemophilia A patients are normally treated with Factor VIII to help with the clotting of their blood. However, since these patients  immune systems have had no or low exposure to Factor VIII, they are often not fully tolerant to the replacement Factor VIII used to treat their condition. Consequently, up to 30 per cent of these patients develop Factor VIII inhibitor antibodies. The development of these antibodies is the most serious complication that significantly limits the treatment of this disorder as well as increasing the cost burden. Apitope has, through its patented discovery platform, completed the research work to confirm that the two peptides in ATX-F8-117, derived from Factor VIII, have the potential to treat and prevent inhibitor development in haemophilia A patients treated with Factor VIII. Currently, there are few therapies available to help patients with inhibitors making the Apitope approach potentially life changing for patients.","Published: June 13, 2015"

This phase will see diagnosis based on whole genome sequencing adopted within the NHS and a reclassification of rare diseases based on an improved understanding of genomics. Tom Weaver, CEO of Cambridge-based Congenica says,  A robust, scalable solution is essential for the NHS. We will be performing whole genomic diagnosis for 2,500 patients, which is unprecedented and will take the technology to the next phase.  Congenica s Sapientia  diagnostic platform, is being used within the 100K Genome Project for Clinical Interpretation. It identifies the single-gene mutations that are associated with diseases and provides this information in a format that can easily be interpreted by a hospital consultant. In the last three years there has been an exponential growth in genetic knowledge and this has seen the identification of nearly 30 new disease genes a month, creating a major challenge for NHS diagnostic services. At present testing for over 600 disorders is available within the NHS, but this represents only a quarter of the known disease genes and these tests are performed step-wise. The introduction of whole genome sequencing has the potential to improve the quality and speed of diagnosis and reduce the cost. The 100k Genomics Project is studying rare diseases to provide proof of concept for an NHS-wide genomic data platform. Over 85% of rare diseases are caused by a single-gene defect so there is a clear association between a single-gene defect and its expression in disease symptoms or  phenotype . This makes it easier to validate the system. Sapientia is based on the pioneering work of Dr Matt Hurles and Dr Richard Durbin, both Senior Group Leaders Genomics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and co-founders of Congenica. Dr Durbin developed techniques to identify, annotate and interpret whole genome DNA sequence data while working on the 1000 Genomes, he says this next stage is vital to develop the reference database:  Not all gene mutations cause disease so patient data is vital to identify which are critical. With access to more data we will be able to improve diagnoses for patients. The Genomic England project aims to establish a platform for the application of high-throughput genomics in routine NHS practice. It aims to sequence 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients by 2017. The project is focusing on patients with rare diseases, and their families, as well as patients with common cancers. Nick Lench, Chief Operating Officer, Congenica comments:  Genomics England has a rigorous tendering process and we were awarded the contract against stiff competition, this is a further validation of our approach and shows the increasing interest and acceptance of Sapientia by the NHS. Over the course of the project our platform will be used both for patient diagnosis and by experts in the field (GeCIPS) to facilitate new gene discovery. ","Published: June 13, 2015"

The award was granted to Hebrew University immunologist Professor Ofer Mandelboim, who studied the function of a protein receptor called NKp46 in the development of Type 1 diabetes. Prof. Mandelboim showed that NKp46 present on Natural Killer cells has a critical role in the development of the disease in mice, and that inhibition of the receptor almost entirely prevented the development of diabetes. This research is the basis for BioLineRx s BL-9020, a novel monoclonal antibody which targets the Natural Killer (NK) receptor NKp46 for the prevention and treatment of Type 1 diabetes. In January 2014, BioLineRx entered into a collaboration agreement with JHL Biotech for the further development and commercialization of BL-9020 in China and additional Southeast Asia countries. Under the terms of the agreement, BioLineRx retains the development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx, stated, ""Type 1 diabetes is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease affecting millions around the world. Currently there is no cure for the disease, and patients with diabetes need to administer insulin on a daily basis throughout their lifetime. Oftentimes, when the disease is diagnosed, patients experience a 'honeymoon period' which may last up to a year, during which there are still some insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Inhibiting the innate immune system, which has shown involvement in the destruction of the pancreas, is a novel approach for such treatment. Based on promising pre-clinical results, we have high hopes that BL-9020 may slow down or halt progression of the disease at this stage, which could be a significant step towards curing diabetes.  BL-9020 is a novel monoclonal antibody treatment designed to prevent immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It was developed to treat Type 1 diabetes in early stage patients, during what is known as the ""honeymoon period,"" where the pancreatic beta cells have not been completely destroyed and continue to secrete insulin. BL-9020 targets NKp46, a unique target that is involved in the innate response against the pancreas. Pre-clinical studies in mouse models of Type 1 diabetes suggest that BL-9020 can inhibit beta cell death, thus preventing full maturation of the disease. This effect could significantly delay, and potentially prevent, the need for chronic insulin use by Type 1 diabetes patients, as well as provide a potential benefit in minimizing diabetes-related complications.","Published: June 13, 2015"

Medication can help, but over time it tends to become less effective. To give these patients another in-home option, Johns Hopkins graduate students have invented a headband-shaped device to deliver noninvasive brain stimulation to help tamp down the symptoms. The students  prototype, developed during a yearlong biomedical engineering master s degree program, has not yet been tested on humans, but it is viewed as a promising first step toward helping Parkinson s patients safely relieve their own symptoms at home or elsewhere without going to a hospital or doctor s office. The design has already received recognition at several prominent competitions. On June 9, it won the $5,000 second-place prize in VentureWell s BMEidea national design contest for biomedical and bioengineering students. In May, the invention earned first-place honors in the People s Choice Award competition at Johns Hopkins  Biomedical Engineering Design Day 2015. Earlier, it was a finalist in the Rice University Business Plan Competition. The five student team members were inspired to build the new device last summer after observing neurosurgery being performed on Parkinson s patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Parkinson s is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 million people in the United States and 7 million worldwide. For patients in advanced stages, one treatment option is deep brain stimulation. In this procedure, a surgeon implants thin electrical leads into the region of the brain that controls movement. The leads are connected to a pulse generator similar to a pacemaker for the heart that is placed under the skin below the collarbone. This implant sends electrical signals to the brain to help curb some symptoms caused by Parkinson s.  We saw that this procedure is really invasive and can take 10 to 15 hours to complete,  said Shruthi Rajan, a team member from Charlotte, North Carolina.  It s also very expensive, and not all patients qualify for the surgery. We asked if there was a way to provide the same treatment in a less invasive way that doesn t require brain surgery.  The students were referred to Yousef Salimpour, a Johns Hopkins Medicine postdoctoral research associate who has been studying a noninvasive Parkinson s therapy called transcranial direct current stimulation. In this painless treatment, low-level current is passed through two electrodes placed over the head to tweak the electrical activity in specific areas of the brain. The technique can be used to excite or inhibit these nerve cells. The treatment is still considered experimental, but it has attracted much attention because it does not require surgery and is inexpensive, safe and relatively easy to administer without any side effects. The biomedical engineering students met with Salimpour to learn about the research he conducts in a clinical setting.  We told him we had an idea for a portable home version of this equipment,  Rajan said.  But we planned to add safety measures to make sure the patient used it properly without a doctor or nurse being present.  The students aimed for a prototype that would enable a patient to activate the battery-powered treatment by touching a large easy-to-press button. With patient safety in mind, the students designed their prototype to deliver current for only 20 minutes daily and only at a doctor-prescribed level. To help fine-tune their design, the students met with dozens of Parkinson s patients over a four-month period. Although the students did not administer the actual brain treatment, the patients help them craft the critical headband component so that it would be easy to put on, comfortable to wear and positioned so that the electrodes would remain stable and properly target the motor cortices areas of the brain.  For a comfortable fit, we put an elastic band in the back and told the patients to put it on like a baseball cap,  said team member Ian Graham, from Old Saybrook, Conn.  The interaction with the patients was really helpful. In our usual college classes, we re just given a textbook problem to solve. In this program, being able to find a real-life biomedical problem and figure out how to address it was huge. And we even received letters of encouragement from some of the patients we met.  The other members of the student design team were David Blumenstyk, Erin Reisfeld and Melody Tan. In addition to the assistance from neuroengineer Salimpour, the student inventors received guidance from other members of an interdisciplinary team of Johns Hopkins medical researchers that includes neurologist Zoltan Mari, neurosurgeon William Anderson and neuroscientist Reza Shadmehr.  Our group is working on the idea of using noninvasive brain stimulation for Parkinson s disease symptom control as a new clinical treatment,  Salimpour said.  Our preliminary results were promising. Patients keep asking us for more of this treatment. But we couldn t provide the treatment for them because there is no portable and FDA-approved device like this for Parkinson s patients that is on the market at this time. The biomedical engineering students then approached us with the idea of designing the home-based treatment device. They did a great job, and made a fascinating prototype. We hope that based on their preliminary work, Parkinson s patients will receive the benefit of this new technique at home very soon.  With help from the Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures staff, the student inventors obtained provisional patents covering the design of the device, dubbed the STIMband. Another Johns Hopkins student team is slated to take over the project in September to further enhance the design and move it closer to patient availability. One addition may be a wireless connection to allow a doctor to adjust a home patient s treatment level from a remote location. Johns Hopkins University  press release","Published: June 13, 2015"

This is presented in research performed by a team led by Christian Keysers and Leonardo Cerliani at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience in Amsterdam. This finding provides a key to understand the often underestimated sensory hypersensitivity in autism and to seed a scientific understanding of how to tackle this hypersensitivity. The research is published in JAMA Psychiatry. People with ASD are known for their unusual behavior in the social environment. Moreover, they often report other traits, linked to the sensory environment: for instance the ability to perceive small details in a picture or to detect a very soft sound coming from a distance. ""This hypersensitivity, however, is not always a gift: being captured by the myriad of sensory stimuli we continuously receive from the environment can be distracting and even overwhelming, and prevents us to focus on what we care most,"" says Cerliani. The scientists present in their research that increased interaction between the cortical ad subcortical brain regions is at the root of this hypersensitivity. Brain regions that are strongly coupled have brain activity that goes up and down together, even while relaxing, while regions that are not coupled will have their brain activity fluctuate independently from each other. By comparing how this spontaneous brain activity synchronizes across various brain regions the team identified an abnormally high synchrony between the sensory cortices involved in perception and subcortical regions relaying information from the sensory organs to the cortex. They found that a higher synchrony was associated with a higher severity of autistic traits. ""During the development from childhood to adolescence, the spontaneous activity of cortical regions involved in basic sensory perception decouples from the activity of subcortical structures relaying sensory information from the sensory organs to the cortex,"" explains Keysers. ""This decoupling is thought to reflect the increasing ability to block out irrelevant sensory information from perception, allowing people to focus on their stream of thoughts and actions. In ASD this process appears to be altered: their sensory cortex appears to be abnormally coupled to subcortical structures."" The team made these observations using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the largest neuroimaging database on ASD aggregated so far: the ABIDE, founded and coordinated by Dr. Adriana Di Martino, Dr. Stuart Mostofsky and Dr. Michael Milham. The team of Keysers and Cerliani also contributed to the aggregation of this database with the neuroimaging data acquired by Dr. Marc Thioux. ASD is an umbrella name for a number of developmental disorders, including classic autism and Asperger syndrome. The number of people with ASD is almost eightfold in the last twenty years and is seen in more than 1% of the children. Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience Keysers C et al.

Kim, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurological surgery.  A successful brain cancer treatment will very likely require blocking the tumor stem cells  ability to survive and replenish themselves.  Kim studies glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer that each year strikes about 18,000 people in the United States. The average length of survival after diagnosis is 15 months, and only 30 percent of patients survive more than two years. Scientists have realized in recent years that some cancer cells in glioblastomas and other tumors are more resistant to treatment than others. Those same, more defiant cells also are much better at re-establishing cancer after treatment.  These tumor stem cells are really the kingpins of cancers the cells that direct and drive much of the harm done by tumors,  said Kim, who treats patients at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. Kim and his colleagues identified a protein, known as SOX2, that is active in brain tumor stem cells and in healthy stem cells in other parts of the body. The researchers found that the tumor stem cells  ability to make SOX2 could be turned up or down via another protein, CDC20. Increasing SOX2 by boosting levels of CDC20 also increased a tumor s ability to grow once transplanted into mice. Eliminating CDC20, meanwhile, left tumor stem cells unable to make SOX2, reducing the tumor stem cells  ability to form tumors.  The rate of growth in some tumors lacking CDC20 dropped by 95 percent compared with tumors with more typical levels of CDC20,  Kim said. When the scientists analyzed human tumor samples, they found that a subset of patients with glioblastomas that had the highest CDC20 levels also had the shortest periods of survival after diagnosis. Kim s lab is exploring methods to block CDC20 in brain tumors, including RNA interference, an approach in which the production of specific proteins is blocked. That general approach is in clinical trials as a therapy for other cancers, viral infections and other illnesses. Washington University in St. Louis   press release Kim AH et al.

This study, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, is one of the first to look at relationships between social media use and sleep issues, and--based on assessments the sentiments expressed in users' tweets--gives preliminary hints that patients with sleep disorders may be a greater risk of psychosocial issues. The study--led by Jared Hawkins, PhD; David McIver, PhD; and John Brownstein, PhD, of Boston Children's Informatics Program and researchers at Merck--is the product of a Boston Children's/Merck collaboration on social media and sleep announced in 2014. Insomnia and other sleep issues affect between 50 and 70 million Americans. Apart from their impact on productivity, accidents and risky behaviors, chronic sleep disorders also contribute to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and depression. Historically, population-level research on sleep disorders has relied on survey methods such as the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System. However, such methods are time- and resource intensive, expensive, suffer from long lag times before reporting and are not generalizable to the larger U.S. population. Research based on social media data may help overcome these limitations. To support such research, Hawkins, McIver, Brownstein and their colleagues sought to develop a ""digital phenotype,"" or baseline profile of what a person suffering insomnia or other sleep disorders ""looks"" like on social media. ""Sleep deprivation and chronic sleep disorders are not well understood,"" said Brownstein, who directs the hospital's Computational Epidemiology Group. ""We wanted to see if we could use new forms of online data, such as Twitter, to characterize the sleep disordered individual and possibly uncover new, previously-undescribed populations of patients suffering sleep problems."" The research team used publically available anonymized data from Twitter to create a virtual cohort of 896 active Twitter users whose tweets contained sleep-related words (e.g., ""can't sleep,"" ""insomnia""), or hashtags (e.g., #cantsleep, #teamnosleep), or the names of common sleep aids or medications. They then compared data from that cohort to those of a second group of 934 users who did not tweet using sleep-related terms. The team examined each user's: The researchers also assessed the time of day and average sentiment--positive, neutral, negative--of each user's tweets. The resulting profile of a Twitter user with sleep issues--compared to a Twitter user without--looked like this: Taken together, the data suggest that Twitter users suffering from a sleep disorder are less active on Twitter on average but tweet more during traditional sleeping hours. The increase in negative sentiment in their tweets suggests that sleep-disordered users could be at an increased risk for psychosocial issues. ""These findings are preliminary and observational only, and need to be studied further,"" Brownstein cautioned. ""But they suggest that social media can be a useful addition to our toolkit for studying the patient experience and behavioral epidemiology of sleep disorders.""

Defects in these  small helpers  are associated with medical conditions like cataracts and cancer.  Like humans, cells often face catastrophic situations. Even though cells are not threatened by hurricanes and earthquakes, the damage induced by heat or radiation is equally devastating: Important proteins that control chemical reactions, transport substances or recognize signal substances, among others, lose their structure and are rendered useless. When this happens, cell processes go out of control. But cells have their own catastrophe prevention systems: Small heat shock proteins prevent other proteins from clotting into irregular clumps to ensure that they can retain their proper structure. This allows them to continue performing their tasks   the cells survive. Nine of these helper proteins are currently known in the human body, and they are very versatile. They do their work in all kinds of tissue: in the brain, in heart and muscles, as well as in the lenses of our eyes where they prevent turbidity. When small heat shock proteins cease to function properly, a broad range of ailments like cataracts, certain neuronal conditions or cancer can ensue. Scientists are thus interested in understanding precisely what the various heat shock proteins are responsible for, what their molecular structures look like and how they are regulated. A group of scientists at the TU M nchen led by Johannes Buchner, Sevil Weinkauf, and Michael Groll, have now for the first time successfully characterized the molecular structure and function of a small heat shock protein that exists exclusively in the eggs and embryos of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode. The researchers determined that the Sip1 protein is responsible specifically for the development of embryos and that it is regulated via the pH value rather than temperature.  Sip1 is the only small heat shock protein that we are aware of exhibiting these properties,  says Buchner.  It assumes the difficult task of maintaining the protein balance in a quickly dividing tissue and an acidic environment during the embryonic phase. No other heat shock protein can do the same.  The members of the small heat shock protein family effectively share the work   with some specialization for preventing different catastrophe scenarios. Even though Sip1 exists only in nematodes, the implications for humans are interesting.  We do not yet know whether a protein with a similar function also plays a role in human embryonic development, but we suspect so,  says Buchner. The great similarity between the small heat shock proteins of nematodes and humans in specific locations becomes apparent in the crystal structure of the Sip1 protein. The manner in which two key parts of the protein complex interact is remarkably similar to that of the alpha-B-crystallin in the lens of the human eye. Understanding the connection between structure, regulation and function of the Sip1 proteins was possible only as a result of the close collaboration between scientists from different research areas at the Department of Chemistry. In biological and biochemical experiments they first determined the significance of Sip1 for the survival of nematode embryos. They discovered how the heat shock protein prevents clotting of important embryonic proteins during heat stress when activated by a low pH value. Electron microscopic and crystal structure analyses put a further piece of the puzzle into place. They showed that the protein is present in multiple forms comprising either 32, 28 or 24 identical subunits. In high pH environments, large complexes dominate and the protein is inactive. When, however, the pH value becomes acidic, the large oligomers dissociate and the protective protein is activated.","Published: June 12, 2015"

The immune organoid was created in the lab of Ankur Singh, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, who applies engineering principles to the study and manipulation of the human immune system.  The synthetic organ is bio-inspired by secondary immune organs like the lymph node or spleen. It is made from gelatin-based biomaterials reinforced with nanoparticles and seeded with cells, and it mimics the anatomical microenvironment of lymphoid tissue. Like a real organ, the organoid converts B cells   which make antibodies that respond to infectious invaders   into germinal centers, which are clusters of B cells that activate, mature and mutate their antibody genes when the body is under attack. Germinal centers are a sign of infection and are not present in healthy immune organs. The engineers have demonstrated how they can control this immune response in the organ and tune how quickly the B cells proliferate, get activated and change their antibody types. According to their paper, their 3-D organ outperforms existing 2-D cultures and can produce activated B cells up to 100 times faster. The immune organ, made of a hydrogel, is a soft, nanocomposite biomaterial. The engineers reinforced the material with silicate nanoparticles to keep the structure from melting at the physiologically relevant temperature of 98.6 degrees. The organ could lead to increased understanding of B cell functions, an area of study that typically relies on animal models to observe how the cells develop and mature. What s more, Singh said, the organ could be used to study specific infections and how the body produces antibodies to fight those infections   from Ebola to HIV.  You can use our system to force the production of immunotherapeutics at much faster rates,  he said. Such a system also could be used to test toxic chemicals and environmental factors that contribute to infections or organ malfunctions. The process of B cells becoming germinal centers is not well understood, and in fact, when the body makes mistakes in the genetic rearrangement related to this process, blood cancer can result.  In the long run, we anticipate that the ability to drive immune reaction ex vivo at controllable rates grants us the ability to reproduce immunological events with tunable parameters for better mechanistic understanding of B cell development and generation of B cell tumors, as well as screening and translation of new classes of drugs,  Singh said.","Published: June 12, 2015"

Azithromycin is the most often prescribed antibiotic in the U.S., where short courses can cure common bacterial infections such as strep throat and sinusitis. But azithromycin, also sold commercially as Zithromax Z-Pak, is never given to patients with some of the most nefarious multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. That s because years of testing in standard laboratory media the nutrient broth that helps bacteria grow concluded that azithromycin doesn t kill these types of bacteria.  Unquestioning adherence to a single standardized lab practice may be keeping doctors from considering potentially life-saving antibiotics therapies that are proven safe and readily available in any hospital or pharmacy,  said senior author Victor Nizet, MD, professor of pediatrics and pharmacy.  While bacterial agars and testing media are useful in providing consistency for hospital laboratories around the world, the actual infection is taking place in the blood and tissues of the patient, and we know the action and potency of drugs can change quite dramatically in different surroundings.  The bacteria at the center of this study are Gram-negative rods, so-called due to their cell wall structure (they appear  negative  in a classic typing test known as the Gram stain) and their shape. Nizet s team studied extremely antibiotic-resistant strains of three medically important Gram-negative rods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. These opportunistic pathogens rarely infect healthy people but instead strike debilitated patients in hospitals, such as those with weakened immune systems, or following trauma or surgery, sometimes with deadly consequences. The Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization have warned that resistance is rapidly spreading in these species, and no new antibiotic candidates are on the horizon. In this study, Nizet s team found that simply growing these Gram-negative rod bacteria in mammalian tissue culture media the same stuff used to sustain human cells in the lab instead of standard bacteriologic media made a huge difference in their sensitivity to azithromycin. Even more striking, the drug-resistant superbugs were completely wiped out when azithromycin was paired with the antibiotic colistin or with antimicrobial peptides produced naturally by the human body during infection. To test these promising laboratory results in a live infection system, Nizet and team moved the experiment into a mouse model of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia. They treated the mice with a single injected dose of azithromycin at a concentration that mimics the amount typically given by IV to human patients. Twenty-four hours after infection, azithromycin-treated mice had 99% fewer bacteria in their lungs than untreated mice. Similarly, in mouse models of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae infections, a single dose of azithromycin reduced bacterial counts by more than 10-fold. According to the authors, the study suggests that the general effectiveness of antibiotics in the decades since the discovery of penicillin has led to complacency in our approach to antibiotic evaluation. In the current era of ever-increasing antibiotic resistance, they recommend a more holistic approach that considers both the bug and the patient s immune system.  If something this simple could be overlooked for so many years, what else might we be missing?  Nizet said.","Published: June 12, 2015"

The collaborative effort by UT Southwestern, Case Western Reserve University, and the University of Kentucky identified an enzyme named 15-PGDH that regulates tissue regeneration in multiple organs. By blocking 15-PGDH in mice with the newly discovered molecule, SW033291, the researchers found that they can rescue damaged bone marrow, liver tissue, and colon tissue. Tissue regeneration is important to recovery from injury, disease, and certain medical treatments.  Patients undergoing bone marrow transplants and patients with colitis may benefit from this approach,  said co-author Dr. James K. Willson, Associate Dean of Oncology Programs, Director of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, Professor of Internal Medicine, and holder of The Lisa K. Simmons Distinguished Chair in Comprehensive Oncology.  We propose that SW033291 will be useful in accelerating recovery of bone marrow cells following a bone marrow transplant and may also be a treatment for colitis.  Bone marrow transplants are a common treatment for leukemia patients, among others. According to the National Cancer Institute, it is estimated that during 2015 there will be 54,270 new cases of leukemia and an estimated 24,450 people will die of this disease. The study is published in the journal Science. Prostaglandin, a hormone-like fatty acid, is a key factor in chronic infections and cancer. ""These inhibitors increase prostaglandin levels in a variety of tissues. For this reason, they appear to help the healing process in at least the intestines, liver, and bone marrow. We are hopeful that inhibiting 15-PGDH represents a general strategy to promote tissue repair,  said co-author Dr. Joseph Ready, Professor of Biochemistry and member of the Simmons Cancer Center. The new SW033291 molecule works by targeting a 15-PGDH-regulated pathway of bone marrow regeneration in which increased bone marrow prostaglandin drives the production of hematopoietic cytokines by CD45-positive marrow cells. The UT Southwestern team discovered the molecule in collaboration with the University of Kentucky and long-time research collaborators at Case Western Reserve: Dr. Sanford Markowitz, Professor of Hematology and Oncology, and head of the Cancer Genetics Program there; and Dr. Stanton Gerson, Professor of Hematology and Oncology, and Director of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. Yongyou Zhang, a Case Western Reserve research associate, was a lead author on the study.

Sleep, as it turns out, may be the one thing that keeps our memories alive and intact. A new study from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) integrates neuroscience and psychological research to reveal how sleep is more complex than the Bard might have imagined. The new research, published online ahead of print by the journal Cell, shows in animal models that sleep suppresses the activity of certain nerve cells that promote forgetting, insuring that at least some memories will last.  Many scientists have tried to figure out how we learn and how our memories become stabilized,  said Ron Davis, chair of the TSRI Department of Neuroscience and senior author of the study.  But far less attention has been paid to forgetting, which is a fundamental function for the brain and potentially has profound consequences for the development of memory therapeutics. Our current study merges the neuroscience of forgetting, that is, the brain mechanisms that lead to forgetting, and the psychology of forgetting into an integrated picture.  Early studies from psychology suggest that sleep facilitates memory retention by stopping interference caused by mental and behavioral activity. That is, sleep essentially isolates the brain from all of the stimuli that can interfere with memory storage. Neuroscience research, on the other hand, suggests that sleep facilitates memory retention by enhancing memory stability or what is called consolidation. The new study in experimental animals reveals the biological underpinnings of the earlier psychology studies, pointing to the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopaminergic activity is known to regulate various types of  plasticity the ability of the brain to change in direct response to learning and memory formation. That ability includes forgetting as well. The study shows that increasing sleep, with either a sleep-promoting drug or by genetic stimulation of the neural sleep circuit, decreases signaling activity by dopamine, while at the same time enhancing memory retention. Conversely, increasing arousal stimulates dopamine signaling and accelerates forgetting. This signal activity isn t constant but is tied directly to the animal s arousal level.  Our findings add compelling evidence to support the model that sleep reduces the forgetting signal in the brain, thereby keeping memories intact,  Davis said.  As sleep progresses to deeper levels, dopamine neurons become less reactive to stimuli and this leads to more stable memories. While the findings bolster earlier psychological studies, they are also not incompatible with more recent findings in neuroscience. The authors note the effects of sleep on memory consolidation and forgetting may operate in parallel and independently of one another or, more intriguingly, in serial in a dependent fashion, with reduced forgetting a prerequisite for sleep-facilitated consolidation. ""We all know that sleep helps us remember,  said Research Associate Jacob A. Berry, the first author of the study and a member of the Davis lab.  Importantly, we have revealed that one of the ways sleep protects a new memory is by quieting dopamine neuron activity that causes forgetting. Since laboratory animals and humans share a need for sleep, as well as many genetic and circuit mechanisms underlying learning and memory, our findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interaction between sleep and memory in humans.""

The research led by researcher Riikka Martikainen is published in Cell Reports. Mitochondria are cellular power plants that use oxygen to produce energy. As a by-product they produce reactive oxygen. Excessive oxygen radicals may cause damage to cells but they are needed in small quantities as important cellular signaling molecules. One of their main functions is to control function of stem cells. Antioxidants are widely used to block the damage caused by reactive oxygen. To enhance their effect some new antioxidants are targeted to accumulate into mitochondria. The current research showed that a small increase in oxygen radicals did not directly lead to cellular damage but disrupted intracellular signaling in stem cells and lead to decrease in their stemness properties. Treatment with antioxidants was able to improve the stemness properties in these cells. However, surprisingly, the researchers found that an antioxidant targeted to mitochondria showed dose-dependent toxic effects especially on neural stem cells. The use of antioxidants as dietary supplements is common, but little is known of their effects on stem cells. This new research shows that large doses of antioxidants may be harmful to neural stem cells. Additional research on stem cells should be done to assess safety of mitochondria targeted antioxidants.

The finding paves the way to a whole new approach for finding a drug that can cure or at least slow the progression of such neurodegenerative diseases as ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The study, published in Nature Communications, shows that the immune system in the animal model C. elegans, a tiny 1 mm-long roundworm, plays a critical role in the development of ALS. ""An imbalance of the immune system can contribute to the destruction of motor neurons and trigger the disease,"" said Alex Parker, CRCHUM researcher and Associate Professor in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Montreal. No effective remedy currently exists for the devastating affliction that is ALS. Those affected by the neuromuscular disease that attacks neurons and the spinal cord gradually become paralyzed and typically die less than five years after the onset of symptoms. Riluzole, the only approved medication only extends the patient's life by a few months. More than a dozen genes are related to ALS. If a mutation occurs in one of them, the person develops the disease. Scientists introduced a mutated human gene (TDP-43 or FUS) into C. elegans, a nematode worm widely used for genetic experiments. The worms became paralyzed within about 10 days. The challenge was to find a way of saving them from certain death. ""We had the idea of modifying another gene -- tir-1 -- known for its role in the immune system,"" said Julie Veriepe, lead investigator and doctoral student under the supervision of Alex Parker. Results were remarkable. ""Worms with an immune deficit resulting from the tir-1 gene's mutation were in better health and suffered far less paralysis,"" she added. This study highlights a never previously suspected mechanism: even if the C. elegans worm has a very rudimentary immune system, that system triggers a misguided attack against the worm's own neurons. ""The worm thinks it has a viral or bacterial infection and launches an immune response. But the reaction is toxic and destroys the animal's motor neurons,"" Alex Parker explained. Is the same scenario at work with people? Most likely. The human equivalent of the tir-1 gene -- SARM1 -- has proved crucial to the nervous system's integrity. Researchers think the signaling pathway is identical for all genes associated with ALS. This makes the TIR-1 protein (or SARM1 in humans) an excellent therapeutic target for development of a medication. SARM1 is particularly important because it is part of the well-known kinase activation process, which can be blocked by existing drugs. Alex Parker's team is already actively testing drugs that have been previously approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of such disorders as rheumatoid arthritis, to see if they work with ALS. Obstacles still remain, however, before finding a remedy for curing or slowing the progression of ALS. ""In our studies with worms, we know the animal is sick because we caused the disease. This allows us to administer treatment very early in the worm's life. But ALS is a disease of aging, which usually appears in humans around the age of 55. We do not know if a potential medication will prove effective if it is only given after appearance of symptoms. But we have clearly demonstrated that blocking this key protein curbs the disease's progress in this worm,"" Alex Parker concluded.

To understand speech, as for other cognitive or sensory processes, the brain breaks down the information it receives to integrate it and give it a coherent meaning. But researchers could not confirm whether oscillations were signs of neuronal activity, or whether these oscillations played an active role in speech processing. Two recent publications -- in eLife and in Frontiers in Human Neurosciences -- shed light on the importance of these oscillations which, when they are not produced as they should, can be associated with significant language disorders. Professor Anne-Lise Giraud and her team at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) reached such conclusions after having created a computerized model of neuronal microcircuits, which highlights the crucial role of neuronal oscillations to decode spoken language, independently of speakers' pace or accent. If neuroscientists have suspected for a long time cortical oscillations to contribute to the interpretation of sensory stimuli in the brain, their exact role has never been demonstrated. Brain activity is indeed rhythmic and appears as periodic electrical variations, classified according to their wavelength. The most well-known -alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta and mu- are detected in association with different types of cognitive activities or states. The alpha waves, for example, are connected to an awake and relaxed state, beta waves to intense concentration, etc. Speech mobilises gamma and theta waves synergistically. To precisely identify the neurobiological processes at work when speech is heard by a human brain, Anne-Lise Giraud's team and colleagues at Ecole Normale Sup rieure (Paris) built a computerized model of neuronal microcircuits which replicates cerebral waves. Their objective was to discover if the theta and gamma-coupled oscillations observed in the auditory cortex are key to understanding and produce speech, or if they are only its consequence, that is, the expression of electrical activity of neurons mobilized at that time. The experts have thus modelled the two types of oscillations involved in speech processing, theta and gamma, and observed how this dual network worked. Using a large corpus of sentences pronounced by English-language speakers showing a great variety of pace and accents, researchers observed that these coupled oscillations split words in an intelligent way: they adapted to the pace of the speaker and could correctly detect not only the syllabic barriers but also syllables identity. Theta oscillation could follow the syllabic pace in a flexible way and synchronize the activity of gamma waves, which can encipher phonemes. A phoneme constitutes the smallest unit of spoken language and helps to constitute the word and distinguish it from other words. Synchronizing these two oscillations is therefore crucial to correctly understand speech. These results, published in eLife, confirm the significance of cortical oscillations in deciphering spoken language. But what happens when the system malfunctions, particularly in the case of dyslexia and autism? Scientists observed that dyslexic people show an anomaly in gamma wave activity, waves which perform phonemic division. As syllabic division is not affected, people with dyslexia can show no trouble in understanding. However, as the format of their mental representation does not match the universal phonemic representation format, learning written language, which is about combining phonemes with letters, becomes difficult. In people with autism, on the other hand, researchers identified that it is the speech information that is not divided up at the right place, which blocks speech deciphering. After examining functional MRI and electroencephalographic results of thirteen people with autism and thirteen people showing no specific troubles, researchers noticed that gamma and theta waves activity did not engage synergistically in the group with autism: theta waves activity fails to track speech modulations and the regulation of gamma oscillations, essential for deciphering the detailed spoken content of words, does not occur. Language disorders which most autistic people suffer from could therefore be explained by an imbalance between slow and fast auditory oscillations, an anomaly which would prevent the interpreting of sensorial information and would compromise the ability to form coherent conceptual representations. In addition, the study shows that the more the desynchronisation is significant, the more the verbal disorder is severe, likewise, autistic symptoms on the whole. ""Of course, autistic disorders are not summed up by the inability to decipher language,"" underlines Professor Anne-Lise Giraud. ""But this strong correlation between oscillatory anomalies in the auditory cortex and the severity of autism highlights a malfunction of cortical microcircuits, which is certainly present elsewhere in the brain. The phenomenon is most probably symptomatic of a more general issue of segmenting and coding sensory information."" These results are the subject of a recent publication in Frontiers in Human Neurosciences. The neuroscientists are now striving after their next experiment: attempting to change the rhythm of abnormal oscillations, and, if they succeed, observing the consequences of this intervention on speech and other cognitive functions, at both short- and long- terms.

Unlocking the mechanisms behind fragile X could make important revelations about the brain. In a new study published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Waisman Center and Department of Neuroscience show that two proteins implicated in fragile X play a crucial role in the proper development of neurons in mice. They also show that while the two proteins act through distinct mechanisms in the formation of new neurons   which send, receive and process information in the brain   they also share some duties. ""This is the first demonstration of the additive function of fragile X proteins in neuronal development,"" says study corresponding author and Waisman Center and Department of Neuroscience Professor Xinyu Zhao. Relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to the cognitive and learning deficits in fragile X syndrome, Zhao says, making it difficult to devise effective therapies. She studies the two fragile X proteins, FMRP and FXR2P, because doing so could yield new information that ultimately leads to treatment for fragile X and other disorders marked by defects in neuronal development, like autism and schizophrenia. For instance, while FXR2P has been shown to be important in autism, the function of the protein and its contribution to fragile X syndrome has been unclear, Zhao says. Fragile X is a genetic condition that affects one in 4,000 males and one in 8,000 females. It's linked to a mutation in the gene that makes the FMRP protein, located on the X chromosome. Up to a third of people with fragile X also have autism. Children with the syndrome are more prone to attention deficit disorder and a diagnosis on the autism spectrum; display physical features such as flat feet, a prominent jaw and forehead, and a long and narrow face; and may have anxiety. Additionally, an estimated one in 250 women and one in 500 men carry a ""premutation"" on the gene that makes FMRP protein, which renders the gene unstable. Carriers can pass it on to future generations and are at greater risk for a Parkinson's disease-like disorder called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. They may also be more prone to stress and other challenges. In a previous study, Zhao's team showed that both FMRP and FXR2P are integral for new neuron production in adult mice and are important for learning and cognition. In the current study, the research team looked at the function of the proteins in the maturation of newly formed adult neurons. The researchers found that mice lacking the FXR2P protein had impaired performance in learning and memory tasks. Using techniques to study newly formed neurons in the brain, the team also found these mice had neurons that did not mature properly. The neurons were also less well connected to other neurons that form important circuits in the brain compared to mice with the protein. The team also highlighted a new interaction between the FXR2P protein and a specific neuronal receptor, a protein charged with receiving messages and passing along information, and showed that the two work together for proper neuronal development. Additionally, it revealed that FXR2P and FMRP work together in regulating this receptor's activity and the maturation of neurons. ""The findings suggest that fostering new nerve cell development during the postnatal period may have therapeutic potential for people with fragile X syndrome and other neurological disorders,"" says Zhao. Her research group will continue to study these proteins and the role they play in neural development and fragile X syndrome   work that's likely to influence other fields of inquiry in autism and beyond. The lab will also work toward translating the findings in mice into human therapies. It is far more challenging to study brain development in people, so mice serve as a model for these studies. ""If we can find a way to reactivate the FMRP gene, we may be able to treat the disease,"" says Zhao.

This docking site functions like an elevator, transporting the toxins into the cell s interior. By binding to the surface receptor, the toxins are able to overcome the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, C. difficile exerts its full lethal effect. The intestinal pathogen C. difficile is most commonly found in hospitals and is often acquired by older people and people with weakened immune systems. In Western countries, infections with so-called hypervirulent strains of C. difficile are rapidly increasing and are much more dangerous and more difficult to treat. The pathology of C. difficile infections is primarily triggered by two toxins released by the pathogen, which then damage the intestinal epithelium. Particularly dangerous hypervirulent strains produce a third toxin, C. difficile transferase (CDT). This CDT toxin modifies the cytoskeleton, causing the host cells to collapse and die. Aktories and Papatheodorou identified the surface protein LSR (lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor) as the receptor for the CDT toxin already in 2011. It is through the LSR that CDT enters the host cell.Bacterial toxins usually exert their full deadly effect in the host cell s interior. The toxins overcome the cell membrane by binding to a surface receptor, which conveys them into the cell s interior. CREDIT:   Panagiotis Papatheodorou Papatheodorou, Aktories and their team of researchers have now identified the regions in the CDT toxin and the LSR receptor that interact with one another. In order to achieve this, the scientists genetically designed truncations of the toxin and the LSR receptor as well as cells without LSR. They then tested whether or not the CDT toxin could bind to its receptor and be absorbed in the cell. They discovered that the parts of the toxin that interact with the receptor are much smaller than previously believed. All that is necessary for toxin absorption is the part of the receptor outside of the cell.  In the future, it should be possible to block these areas in the toxin and receptor in order to prevent the toxin from entering the host cell,  Papatheodorou explained.","Published: June 11, 2015"

DNA sequences that are conserved across species are likely to be functionally important, while variations between members of the same species can indicate different susceptibilities to disease. The basic algorithm for determining how much two sequences of symbols have in common   the  edit distance  between them   is now more than 40 years old. And for more than 40 years, computer science researchers have been trying to improve upon it, without much success. At the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), MIT researchers will report that, in all likelihood, that s because the algorithm is as good as it gets. If a widely held assumption about computational complexity is correct, then the problem of measuring the difference between two genomes   or texts, or speech samples, or anything else that can be represented as a string of symbols   can t be solved more efficiently. In a sense, that s disappointing, since a computer running the existing algorithm would take 1,000 years to exhaustively compare two human genomes. But it also means that computer scientists can stop agonizing about whether they can do better.  This edit distance is something that I ve been trying to get better algorithms for since I was a graduate student, in the mid- 90s,  says Piotr Indyk, a professor of computer science and engineering at MIT and a co-author of the STOC paper.  I certainly spent lots of late nights on that   without any progress whatsoever. So at least now there s a feeling of closure. The problem can be put to sleep.  Moreover, Indyk says, even though the paper hasn t officially been presented yet, it s already spawned two follow-up papers, which apply its approach to related problems.  There is a technical aspect of this paper, a certain gadget construction, that turns out to be very useful for other purposes as well,  Indyk says. Edit distance is the minimum number of edits   deletions, insertions, and substitutions   required to turn one string into another. The standard algorithm for determining edit distance, known as the Wagner-Fischer algorithm, assigns each symbol of one string to a column in a giant grid and each symbol of the other string to a row. Then, starting in the upper left-hand corner and flooding diagonally across the grid, it fills in each square with the number of edits required to turn the string ending with the corresponding column into the string ending with the corresponding row. Computer scientists measure algorithmic efficiency as computation time relative to the number of elements the algorithm manipulates. Since the Wagner-Fischer algorithm has to fill in every square of its grid, its running time is proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings it s considering. Double the lengths of the strings, and the running time quadruples. In computer parlance, the algorithm runs in quadratic time. That may not sound terribly efficient, but quadratic time is much better than exponential time, which means that running time is proportional to 2N, where N is the number of elements the algorithm manipulates. If on some machine a quadratic-time algorithm took, say, a hundredth of a second to process 100 elements, an exponential-time algorithm would take about 100 quintillion years. Theoretical computer science is particularly concerned with a class of problems known as NP-complete. Most researchers believe that NP-complete problems take exponential time to solve, but no one s been able to prove it. In their STOC paper, Indyk and his student Art rs Ba kurs demonstrate that if it s possible to solve the edit-distance problem in less-than-quadratic time, then it s possible to solve an NP-complete problem in less-than-exponential time. Most researchers in the computational-complexity community will take that as strong evidence that no subquadratic solution to the edit-distance problem exists. The core NP-complete problem is known as the  satisfiability problem : Given a host of logical constraints, is it possible to satisfy them all? For instance, say you re throwing a dinner party, and you re trying to decide whom to invite. You may face a number of constraints: Either Alice or Bob will have to stay home with the kids, so they can t both come; if you invite Cindy and Dave, you ll have to invite the rest of the book club, or they ll know they were excluded; Ellen will bring either her husband, Fred, or her lover, George, but not both; and so on. Is there an invitation list that meets all those constraints? In Indyk and Ba kurs  proof, they propose that, faced with a satisfiability problem, you split the variables into two groups of roughly equivalent size: Alice, Bob, and Cindy go into one, but Walt, Yvonne, and Zack go into the other. Then, for each group, you solve for all the pertinent constraints. This could be a massively complex calculation, but not nearly as complex as solving for the group as a whole. If, for instance, Alice has a restraining order out on Zack, it doesn t matter, because they fall in separate subgroups: It s a constraint that doesn t have to be met. At this point, the problem of reconciling the solutions for the two subgroups   factoring in constraints like Alice s restraining order   becomes a version of the edit-distance problem. And if it were possible to solve the edit-distance problem in subquadratic time, it would be possible to solve the satisfiability problem in subexponential time.  This is really nice work,  says Barna Saha, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Massachusetts atAmherst.  There are lots of people who have been working on this problem, because it has a big practical impact. But they won t keep trying to develop a subquadratic algorithm, because that seems very unlikely to happen, given the result of this paper.  As for the conjecture that the MIT researchers  proof depends on   that NP-complete problems can t be solved in subexponential time    It s a very widely believed conjecture,  Saha says.  And there are many other results in this low-polynomial-time complexity domain that rely on this conjecture.","Published: June 11, 2015"

Bacterial can pick up external signals, which then relay to internal signaling pathways that direct their behavior. This surveillance also can trigger survival tactics for a variety of harsh situations, such as lack of nutrients or the presence of antibiotics. The microbiologists were particularly interested in the sensing done by the food-poisoning bacteria, Salmonella. The pathogen is adept at adjusting to different locations and surrounding conditions. One of its safety strategies is to gather into a biofilm: a collection of bacteria huddled together in a protective coating.In a screening method to detect signals that regulate bacteria behavior, a biosensor is at work in Salmonella. Courtesy of Erez Mills/Miller Lab/UW Salmonella biofilms can grow persistently on many surfaces and can make the pathogen resistant to infection control measures. This is significant problem in the food-processing industry. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Salmonella causes more than 1.2 million episodes of illness a year in the United States alone. To adapt so readily, noted the authors of the report, Salmonella typhimurium bacteria need to figure out if they are in the stomach, within cells, or on a plant or other surface.  Salmonella typhimurium is the most studied bacterial pathogen; yet, the researchers added, little is known about what Salmonella typhimurium senses in the environment. The researchers on the study were Erez Mills, Erik Petersen, and Bridget R. Kulasekara, working in the University of Washington laboratory of Samuel I. Miller, professor of medicine, microbiology, immunology, and genome sciences. They describe a new screen they designed to identify the environmental cues Salmonella picks up and that, in turn, modulate the production of a second messenger molecule. This molecule, cyclic-di-GMP, governs bacterial motility and biofilm formation in many species of bacteria in response to environmental conditions, but up to now specific signals that modulate cyclic-di-GMP in Salmonella were largely unknown. The researchers discovered that many environmental signals modulate cyclic-di-GMP in Salmonella typhimurium and subsequently altered its biofilm formation.  Their screen for these signals and their actions was based on a combination of leading-edge technologies, including a genetically engineered biosensor for cyclic-di-GMP, used with either microscopy or flow cytometry, a laser-based measurement on single cells suspended in a fluid.  The most interesting signal we identified was L-arginine, one of the twenty commonly used amino acids,  the researchers noted. They explained that Salmonella typhimurium specifically responds to very low concentrations of L-arginine, in amounts too little to be utilized as a nutrient source. The researchers think the sensing of these low levels of L-arginine tells the bacterium that it is in a particular type of environment and signals the bacterium to adapt accordingly. Future work, they said, will be aimed at determining the types of environments where L-arginine is sensed, as well as the bacterium s behavior in response to L-arginine. In addition to providing new information on how Salmonella typhimurium senses chemical signals in its environment, the method the scientists designed can be used in studies of other bacterial species to increase knowledge about microbial sensing.  Possible applications range from combating antibiotic resistant bacteria to ameliorating agricultural and industrial biofouling.","Published: June 11, 2015"

The two assays are the latest additions to the growing menu of CE-marked assays for use on the DxN VERIS Molecular Diagnostics System.  Beckman Coulter is committed to the ongoing development of assays for DxN VERIS and aims to rapidly expand the DxN VERIS infectious disease portfolio, delivering assays that are both cost- and time-effective,  said Arnd Kaldowski, president, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics. Like all DxN VERIS assays, the HCV and HIV assays are supplied in the unique DxN VERIS single cartridge system, which reduces wastage and consumable costs compared to traditional batch-plate systems.  Tests can be up and running in 10 minutes and, with true single sample random access and the shortest turnaround time available, results can be delivered to physicians faster than ever before,  said Richard Creager, senior vice president, Molecular Diagnostics Business Unit, and chief scientific officer at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics. With proven sensitivity, specificity and precision, the CE-marked DxN VERIS HCV Assay reliably detects HCV genotypes one to six, and is calibrated to the 4th WHO International Standard for HCV (NIBSC 06/102) using the DxN VERIS technology. The prevalence of HCV infection in Europe ranges from 0.4% to 3.5% by country, however the full burden of HCV is unknown due to differences in surveillance systems across Europe. HCV RNA quantification is invaluable for the assessment and monitoring of patients undergoing antiviral treatment, helping to assess patient compliance, to inform response guided therapy and to determine sustained viral response (SVR), which corresponds to a definitive cure of HCV infection in more than 99% of cases. With rapid, automated sample processing, amplification and detection on DxN VERIS and an assay run-time of less than 102 minutes, the DxN VERIS HCV Assay delivers results in the shortest time possible, allowing faster clinical decision making and improved HCV patient management. In 2011, it was estimated that 2.3 million people were living with HIV throughout Europe and Central Asia, with approximately 170,000 newly diagnosed cases that year. Quantitative measurement of HIV-1 RNA viral load in plasma plays a vital role in the prognosis and management of patients infected with HIV-1, helping to decide when antiretroviral therapy should be initiated, to monitor response to treatment and to predict clinical progression. With rapid, automated sample processing, amplification and detection on DxN VERIS and an assay run-time of less than 87 minutes, the DxN VERIS HIV-1 Assay delivers results in the shortest time possible, allowing faster clinical decision making and improved HIV patient management. With proven sensitivity and precision, the CE-marked DxN VERIS HIV-1 Assay is available for 1000  L and 175  L sample volumes. The DxN VERIS HIV-1 Assay reliably detects HIV-1 subtypes: Group M (A, C, D, F, G, H); Group N; Group O; CRF AE and CRF AG11, and is traceable to the WHO International Standard for HIV-1 using the DxN VERIS technology. In addition to the DxN VERIS HCV and DxN VERIS HIV Assays, the range of CE-marked assays for use on the DxN VERIS also includes DxN VERIS CMV Assay (for the quantitative determination of human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in plasma) and DxN VERIS HBV Assay (for quantitative measurement of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) in plasma and serum), with many other assays under development.","Published: June 11, 2015"

This gave them an advantage wherever crop rotation was practiced: If a female rootworm beetle lingered long enough in a soybean field to deposit her eggs there, and that field was planted with corn the following spring, her larvae would emerge, feed on corn roots and grow up to repeat the cycle. (Any larvae that emerge in soybean fields will die.)   The new study looks at gene expression in the insect s gut, and also finds significant differences between rotation-resistant and susceptible (also called  wild type ) rootworm beetles. These differences in gene expression may help researchers develop molecular markers to identify rotation-resistant rootworms and improve rootworm-management strategies.  We found many genes that are differentially expressed between wild-type and rotation-resistant rootworms   over 3,000 genes,  Seufferheld said.  Some of these genes code for proteins involved in immune regulation and antimicrobial functions, he said. This could help explain the differences seen in microbial populations in the digestive systems of rotation-resistant and wild-type rootworms, he said. The same types of microbes are present in each, but in different proportions. In an earlier study, Seufferheld and his colleagues found that rotation-resistant rootworms had higher activity of a protein known as cathepsin L. This enzyme helps the beetles digest soybean leaves and its increased activity gives rotation-resistant bugs an edge over their wild-type peers. When the researchers treated the bugs with antibiotics, however, the level of cathepsin L activity in the rotation-resistant rootworms dropped to that of the wild-type bugs. This caused the rotation-resistant beetles to die just as quickly as their wild-type peers on a diet of soybean leaves.   The microbial community is somehow helping the rootworms boost the cathepsin levels,  Seufferheld said.  We don t know exactly how.  We also found differentially regulated genes involved in detoxification and genes involved in transport of metabolic products, lipids, sterols and drugs in and out of the cell,  Seufferheld said. Some of these genes are associated with insect resistance to other toxins, he said.  The new study deepens scientists  understanding of the complex interplay of forces that give rise to rotation resistance, he said.   The evolution of resistance in insects is complex: Human activity, the evolutionary history of the insects, the host and non-host plants, the microbial community and the genes all play a role,  Seufferheld said.  All of these factors exist within an environmental context, he said. In areas dominated by corn and soybeans, rotation-resistance is more prevalent, while more diverse agricultural landscapes that also include corn and soybeans report no problem with rotation resistance.   When we disturb the ecology with our agricultural landscape, there are going to be consequences   even with the most ecologically benign approaches, such as crop rotation,  Seufferheld said.  Understanding the interplay of ecology and evolution will allow us to design more sustainable agricultural practices while minimizing undesirable consequences. ","Published: June 11, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/designing-new-pain-relief-drugs-192208,Designing New Pain Relief Drugs Researchers have identified the molecular interactions that allow capsaicin to activate the body s primary receptor for sensing heat and pain  paving the way for the design of more selective and effective drugs to relieve pain   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Capsaicin is the ingredient that makes chili peppers spicy and hot. The same pathway in the body that responds to spicy food is also activated after injury or when the immune system mounts an inflammatory response to bacteria, viruses, or in the case of autoimmune disease, the body s own tissues.  While we have known that capsaicin binds to the TRPV1 receptor with exquisite potency and selectivity, we were missing important atomic-level details about exactly how the capsaicin molecule interacts with TRPV1, one of the body s primary receptors for sensing pain and heat,  saidJie Zheng, professor of physiology and membrane biology at UC Davis and senior author on the paper. Using computer models based on atomic force fields and existing low resolution 3-D reconstructions of the TRPV1-capsaicin complex, the researchers identified several structural areas that enable capsaicin to strongly bind to the TRPV1 receptor.    Computational biology methods are becoming very powerful tools for predicting and ultimately validating the high-resolution structure of important biological proteins and ligands, such as capsaicin and TRPV1, when they interact,  said Vladimir Yarov-Yarovoy, assistant professor of physiology and membrane biology at UC Davis and co-author on the study.  These tools are especially useful when the interactions are small and transient, and cannot be captured easily with high-enough resolution using traditional experimental approaches.  Fan Yang, postdoctoral fellow in the Zheng lab at UC Davis and first author on the paper, agrees.  The electron density observed in the cryo electron microscopy structure of the TRPV1-capsaicin complex is much smaller in size compared to the chemical structure of capsaicin,  Yang said.  With computational docking, we were able to detail the atomic interactions between capsaicin and the TRPV1 channel and later validate the molecular architecture using other experimental approaches.  The new structural information may serve to guide the drug-design process, the researchers said.   Just as we can  get used to  a spicy dish by the end of the meal, we believe that there are ways to develop highly specific molecules that make TRPV1 less sensitive to painful stimuli,"" Zheng said.  The research also explains why capsaicin does not activate the body s other channels for sensing temperature, and why the TRPV1 receptor in many other species is not activated by capsaicin.  For example, birds are missing two key interaction sites, which explains why birds are insensitive to the spiciness of chili peppers.  It is thought that the presence of capsaicin is an evolutional advantage for plants, protecting them from species that would eat the leaves while allowing birds to ingest the peppers to spread the seed,  Zheng said.  The researchers also found that sweet peppers contain a compound called capsiate, which is almost identical to capsaicin in spicy peppers but differs at one key interaction site.    The difference is sufficient to make the sweet pepper compound bind to TRPV1 very poorly, which is probably part of the reason why it does not taste spicy,  Zheng said.  On the Scoville pungency scale, capsaicin is 16 million, and capsiate is only 16,000. ","Published: June 11, 2015"

When the PQBP1 encounters the virus, it starts a program that triggers an overall protective environment against infection and enhances the production of virus-specific antibodies. Human cell infected by multiple HIV particles. Courtesy of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute.   Vaccines work by teaching the immune system to react by mimicking a natural infection,  said lead author Sunnie Yoh, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Sumit Chanda, Ph.D., director of the Immunity and Pathogenesis Program at Sanford-Burnham.  Designing a drug that mimics the interface between HIV and PQBP1 would allow an HIV vaccine to more effectively re-create an immune environment that mirrors real infection.   Current approaches to HIV vaccine development have thus far yielded little fruit, partly because of the lack of an effective vaccine adjuvant. Adjuvants promote a robust immune response to vaccines and are critical to eliciting long-lasting immunity,  said Chanda.  Our study identifies a promising new target for a vaccine adjuvant that could advance the development of HIV vaccines and prevent infection.  How it works  Although the major target of HIV infection is CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells are one of the first cell types to encounter HIV during sexual transmission. After HIV infects cells, its DNA forms an interface with PQBP1 in sentinel dendritic cells and initiates the immune response. Dendritic cells control the innate immune response a generic, non-specific defense against pathogens. These cells also activate the adaptive immune response that generates highly specific antibodies that provide protective, long-lasting immunity. Both the innate and adaptive immune systems are necessary to provide an optimal immune response to vaccines.  PQBP1 acts as a sentry for innate immune response to HIV. The development of a highly effective HIV vaccine will likely depend on both combining the correct immunogens, which are viral proteins, and unlocking the innate response, to establish long-lived protection,  said Chanda.  Now that we know the gatekeeper, it will be much easier to find a key. ","Published: June 11, 2015"

To accelerate tACPA development towards clinical Proof of Concept, facilitate funding, and attract a development partner, Citryll B.V. was founded as a single asset drug development company. The tACPAs are active in different validated RA animal models and models for other human diseases. They exert their therapeutic effect by inhibiting the formation of Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as shown with primary human neutrophils. NETs are extracellular lattices of decondensed chromatin decorated with antimicrobial factors, whose function is to eliminate invading microorganisms. Dysregulated NETosis constitutes a pathogenic mechanism in autoimmune and sterile inflammatory diseases. This offers novel therapeutic opportunities for diseases with unmet medical needs, including RA, where existing treatments can have serious side-effects and comprise a significant percentage of non-responders. NETosis is peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) dependent, creating neo-epitopes that trigger autoimmunity and breaking of tolerance in RA. ModiQuest has discovered tACPAs using its proprietary antibody generation technology platforms ModiFuse  (highly efficient hybridoma electrofusion technology), ModiSelect  (B cell selection technology for low immunogenic or multiple antigen targets) and ModiPhage  (proprietary phage display libraries).

The initiatives include an additional staff shift for daily clinical manufacturing operations, as well as the doubling of capacities for performing visual inspection and In-Process Control (IPC). The facility also expanded its on-site offerings by giving customers the option to obtain secondary packaging services for small batches of frozen drug products such as vial labeling, cartoning, and carton labeling. Furthermore, the long-term collaboration with Sentry BioPharma Services, a provider of cGMP clinical packaging solutions and supply chain management, supports a streamlined path from filling to clinic. Satisfied customer demand creates a positive business outlook We are extremely pleased with our past years performance at the Skokie facility, as well as our overall success to date,  said Vetter Managing Director Peter Soelkner. The site, located at the Illinois Science + Technology Park in suburban Chicago has successfully passed audits and qualifications by as many as 30 companies, including 9 of the top 20 leading (bio-)pharmaceutical companies. This performance has resulted in a wide-ranging customer base that includes not only those in the US, but also European companies based for example in the UK and Denmark, as well as Asian headquartered companies such as in South Korea.  Many of our customers have already returned for development work for a second, third, or even fourth molecule,  added Dr. Susanne Resatz, President of Vetter Development Services USA, Inc. who is responsible for heading up the operation.  Furthermore, our outlook for future performance is very positive as demonstrated by a pipeline filled with high quality customer projects for biologics.  Drugs under development by Vetter s customers include treatments for blood cancer, muscular dystrophy, wound healing, and dwarfism. Company-wide consistency in filling lines, processes, and quality systemsAs a CDMO, Vetter offers manufacturing resources starting from early drug development through to market launch and commercial supply. If desired, customers can not only get a  modular service  offering, but also a seamless transfer approach for their drug product from Vetter s US early-stage facility to one of its European development and commercial manufacturing facilities. The sites on both continents use similar equipment and processes whenever possible, including product contact materials such as excipients and primary packaging materials. This flexible approach results in less overall risk of unforeseen manufacturing issues, and creates a consistency between clinical and commercial drug product handling. In addition, the core of the aseptic manufacturing process i.e., the filling lines themselves are designed in the same manner at Vetter s clinical and commercial sites. The Chicago facility, designed specifically for high yield and flexible use, employs scaled-down versions of the company s commercial filling lines. This aligned facilities approach reduces time and means less development work will be necessary to realize the transfer and scale-up process of the individual customer drug product. Furthermore, all Vetter sites in US and Europe are part of the same company-wide Quality System, offering a consistent quality approach over a project lifetime and avoiding non-productive time to adapt to new systems. The interaction of Vetter teams from both the US and Europe allows customers to access global expertise as necessary, an attribute that is especially valuable for projects with a very high level of complexity. To date, four customer products in development have already been successfully transferred from Vetter s US clinical manufacturing facility to the company s European sites for manufacturing of late-stage clinical supply and for subsequent commercial production. The company plans for additional product transfers from the US to Europe in the near future.","Published: June 11, 2015"

The findings could lead to the development of interventions to help the more than half of individuals with autism who have very strong negative responses to sensory stimuli, a condition called sensory over-responsivity. Interventions for this condition could significantly improve the lives of children with this form of autism and their families, said Shulamite Green, the study s first author and a postdoctoral fellow in the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA.  This condition is distressing and impairing for individuals on the autism spectrum, as well as for their parents, who often feel confined to their homes because it s too difficult to take their children out shopping, to the movies or to a restaurant,  Green said.  Our research provides new insights into the brain differences that may cause sensory over-responsivity, which helps us understand how to treat it   from simple interventions like limiting exposure to multiple sensory stimuli to more complex interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy.  The study was published online June 10 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. Autism spectrum disorder can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that about 1 in 68 children have autism, which is almost five times as common in boys as in girls. Green said research on sensory over-responsivity, and particularly brain imaging research, is still very new, and sensory symptoms were only recently added to the diagnostic criteria for autism.  One surprise finding was the large differences in brain response between youth with autism who have sensory over-responsivity and those who do not,  said Mirella Dapretto, the study s senior author and a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the Semel Institute.  Youth with autism who do not have sensory over-responsivity have brain responses to sensory stimuli much more similar to their counterparts without autism, and we showed that there may be a compensatory mechanism in the brain helping them regulate their responses.  For the study, the UCLA team imaged brain responses to auditory and tactile stimuli in young people between the ages of 9 and 17, some with autism and some without. During imaging, each of the study s participants was exposed to three kinds of sensory stimuli   hearing loud environment noises such as traffic, being rubbed on the inner arm with a scratchy wood fabric or experiencing both the auditory and tactile stimuli simultaneously. The team found that study participants with autism and sensory over-responsivity had stronger brain responses to the sensory stimuli in brain areas that process sensory information, as well as in the amygdala, an area involved in attention, response to threat and emotional reactions. The brain responses were even more severe when participants with autism and sensory over-responsivity were exposed to the auditory and tactile stimuli simultaneously. They also found that all study participants showed a similar initial brain response to the stimuli, but youth with autism and sensory over-responsivity took much more time to get used to the stimuli   and to reduce their brain response   than children with autism but not sensory over-responsivity. Green said that those children may be compensating through strong brain connectivity between their prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The prefrontal cortex, Green said, is helping to regulate the strong response of the amygdala.  We don t have many good treatments for sensory over-responsivity, but our results suggest that an effective treatment might focus on creating coping skills to deal with stimulating environments rather than focusing on changing sensory processing,  Green said.  I also think parents and others working with kids with autism need to be aware of their sensory environments.  The UCLA team has received a grant from the Simons Foundation to continue to study how youths with autism and sensory over-responsivity process sensory stimulation. They hope to better characterize the neurobiology of the brain s reaction. UCLA Health   press release Dapretto M et al.

Lesions include tumors, abnormal blood vessel formations and abscesses and inflammation due to infections. In the pediatric population, such lesions ""can have a large variety of underlying etiologies (causes), which can be challenging to differentiate on neuroimaging,"" lead author Marisa McGinley, MD, and colleagues report. The Loyola physicians report the case of a 12-year-old boy who came to his primary care physician with staring episodes. During these episodes, which lasted about one minute, the boy was unresponsive and would make wringing motions with his hands. Afterwards, he would feel tired. His physician put him on an anti-seizure medication. An MRI showed a lesion in the brain called the left mesial temporal lobe. The boy underwent brain surgery to remove a large portion of the lesion. He recovered well from the surgery, but continued to have occasional seizures. Five years after the surgery, he was having two to three seizures per month, despite taking two anti-seizure medications. In order to get better seizure control, he underwent a second surgery to remove the remaining lesion. His anti-seizure medications gradually were reduced, and three years after the second surgery, he was seizure-free. Pathology from the second surgery showed the lesion was consistent with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins. The AVM likely was present at birth. The case highlights the challenge in distinguishing different lesions based on imaging, researchers write. MRIs can provide much information about a lesion, and it is important to carefully analyze available imaging to obtain as much information as possible. If diagnosis remains uncertain, it may be helpful to use other imaging techniques, such as PET scans and MR spectroscopy. ""Finally, when a diagnosis remains unclear, biopsy needs to be considered, but ultimately it is the entire work-up and clinical picture that will lead to a correct diagnosis,"" researchers write.

Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have -- for the first time -- documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone. This novel research merges brain science and instructional innovation, two of Carnegie Mellon's university-wide initiatives -- BrainHub, which focuses on how the structure and activity of the brain give rise to complex behaviors, and the Simon Initiative, which aims to measurably improve student learning outcomes by harnessing decades of learning science research. Marcel Just, a leading neuroscientist, pointed to the Smithsonian Institute's 2013 announcement about the olinguito, a newly identified carnivore species that mainly eats fruits and lives by itself in the treetops of rainforests, as an example of the type of new concept that people learn. 'Millions of people read the information about the olinguito and in doing so permanently changed their own brains,' said Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. 'Our research happened to be examining this process precisely at that time in a laboratory setting. When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus -- as well as several other areas -- stored the new information according to its own code.' Just added, 'The new knowledge gained from the Smithsonian's announcement became encoded in the same brain areas in every person that learned the new information, because all brains appear to use the same filing system.' For the study, Andrew Bauer, a Ph.D. student in psychology, and Just taught 16 study participants diet and dwelling information about extinct animals to monitor the growth of the neural representations of eight new animal concepts in the participants' brains. Drawing on previous findings, the research team knew 'where' to expect the new knowledge to emerge in the brains of their participants. Information about dwellings and information about eating have each been shown to reside in their own set of brain regions, regions that are common across people. Over the course of an hour, the study participants were given a zoology mini-tutorial on the diets and habitats of the animals, while the scientists used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor the emergence of the concepts in the participants' brains. As the new properties were taught, the activation levels in the eating regions and the dwelling regions changed. One important result was that after the zoology tutorial, each one of the eight animal concepts developed its own unique activation signature. This made it possible for a computer program to determine which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at a given time. In effect, the program was reading their minds as they contemplated a brand-new thought. But even though the animals had unique activation signatures, the animals that shared similar properties (such as a similar habitat) had similar activation signatures. That is, a resemblance between the properties of two animals resulted in a resemblance between their activation signatures. This finding shows that the activation signatures are not just arbitrary patterns, but are meaningful and interpretable. 'The activation signature of a concept is a composite of the different types of knowledge of the concept that a person has stored, and each type of knowledge is stored in its own characteristic set of regions,' Just said. Another important result was that once a property of an animal was learned, it remained intact in the brain, even after other properties of the animal had been learned. This finding indicates the relative neural durability of what we learn. 'Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way,' said Bauer, the study's lead author. 'It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.' Just believes that the study provides a foundation for brain researchers to trace how a new concept makes its way into the brain from the words and graphics used to teach it, foreshadowing a capability to assess the progress in learning a complicated concept like those in a high-school physics lesson. fMRI pattern analyses could diagnose which aspects of a concept students misunderstand (or lack), in a way that could guide the next iteration of instruction. The results from this study also indicate that it may be possible to use a similar approach to understand the 'loss' of knowledge in various brain disorders, such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease, or due to brain injuries. The loss of a concept in the brain may be the reverse of the process that the study observed. Carnegie Mellon University   Original reporting by: Shilo Rea Andrew James Bauer, Marcel Adam Just.

This breakthrough finding also points to new approaches for treating chronic pain, which is second only to bipolar disorder among illness-related causes of suicide. About a quarter of Americans suffer from chronic pain, making it the most common form of enduring illness for those under the age of 60. The Institute of Medicine estimates that this costs our society more than $635 billion per year. In work with rodents, Catherine Cahill, associate professor of anesthesiology & perioperative care at UCI, Christopher Evans of UCLA's Brain Research Institute, and colleagues discovered that pain-derived brain inflammation causes the accelerated growth and activation of immune cells called microglia. These cells trigger chemical signals within neurons that restrict the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain's reward and pleasure centers. The study also reveals why opioid drugs such as morphine can be ineffective against chronic pain. Morphine and its derivatives normally stimulate the release of dopamine. But in research on mice and rats in chronic pain, Cahill and her colleagues learned that these drugs failed to stimulate a dopamine response, resulting in impaired reward-motivated behavior. Treating these animals in chronic pain with a drug that inhibits microglial activation restored dopamine release and reward-motivated behavior, Cahill said. 'For over 20 years, scientists have been trying to unlock the mechanisms at work that connect opioid use, pain relief, depression and addiction,' she added. 'Our findings represent a paradigm shift which has broad implications that are not restricted to the problem of pain and may translate to other disorders.' The results of the five-year study appear online in the Journal of Neuroscience. Next, Cahill and her team aim to establish that pain-derived changes in human brain circuitry can account for mood disorders. ""We have a drug compound that has the potential to normalize reward-like behavior,"" she said, ""and subsequent clinical research could then employ imaging studies to identify how the same disruption in reward circuitry found in rodents occurs in chronic pain patients.""

Calyxt s technology allows for the custom gene-editing of plant species to create novel traits and increase value. In particular, Calyxt will be applying its patented nuclease technology to develop a series of alfalfa seed products based on editing of native genes to improve the agronomic and quality value of alfalfa for the food and agriculture industries. The approach is based on the same principle as classical cross-breeding of different plants, however the gene editing technology developed by Calyxt dramatically accelerates the development timeline. The targeted approach of gene editing is more predictable and reliable than traditional breeding and can also be much more cost effective. The companies will look to commercialize products through S&W and Calyxt s distribution channels with pre-defined financial terms. Mark Grewal, Chief executive officer of S&W Seed Company commented,  This agreement with Calyxt continues to position S&W at the forefront of alfalfa seed research and development. The Calyxt technology allows for the development of unique traits in alfalfa seeds. The ability to provide enhanced traits in alfalfa seed varieties opens up what we believe will be a significant opportunity for us, our partners, and Calyxt. The world will continue to need varieties that can drive increases in productivity, while decreasing input costs to meet global demands. Our goal at S&W is to meet those challenges.  Luc Mathis, Chief executive officer of Calyxt commented,  S&W Seed Company is a great partner for us to address the alfalfa market, combining the ability to generate new traits into superior genetics, with a clear path to market. The partnership fits well with our vision of bringing higher quality products also for the feed industry. ","Published: June 10, 2015"

The germ is also estimated to cause infections killing 18,000 people every year in the U.S. But the potentially deadly unwelcome guests are a product of environment, not genes   and can be pushed out by benign bacteria, according to an international study of twins.  This is study is important because it suggests that the bacteria in the nose are not defined by our genes and that we may be able to introduce good bacteria to knock out bad bugs like Staph,  said Lance Price, the director of the Translational Genomics Research Institute  Center for Microbiomics and Human Health.  Using probiotics to promote gut health has become common in our culture. Now we re looking to use these same strategies to prevent the spread of superbugs.  The nasal microbiome is the collection of bacteria and germs living deep within the nose. The scientific team   which included the Statens Serum Institut and the Milken Institute at George Washington University   analyzed 46 identical twins and 43 fraternal twins through the famed Danish Twin Registry. They found there is  no genetically inherent cause for specific bacteria in the nasal microbiome,  said Paal Skytt Anderson, of the Statens Serum Institut. Instead, the bacteria appear to be determined by the environment. Other bacteria could be cultivated, instead, to prevent the buildup of Staph, the scientists believe. They also found, contrary to previous studies, that men are not at higher risk for Staph nasal colonization.  We believe this study provides the early evidence that the introduction of probiotics could work to prevent or knock out Staph from the nose,  said Cindy Liu, a pathology resident at Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine, who was also the study s lead author.  This was a surprising finding.  Stanford investigators first recognized that about a third of all people carry significant amounts of Staph deep in their nasal passages, in a 2013 study. Another third occasionally carry the germ, and the remaining third appear to never carry the bacteria in their noses, they found.","Published: June 10, 2015"

L. Wong, a UCLA professor of bioengineering and chemistry who is affiliated with CNSI, the multidisciplinary team also included Michel Gilliet of Switzerland s Lausanne University Hospital, and Jure Dobnikar and Daan Frenkel of the University of Cambridge.  Autoimmune diseases strike when the body attacks itself because it fails to distinguish between host tissue and disease-causing agents, or pathogens. Two such disorders are lupus, which can damage the skin, joints and organs, causing rashes, hair loss and fatigue; and psoriasis, which causes rashes, lesions and arthritis, and creates an increased risk for cancer and diabetes. When a healthy person is infected by a virus, viral DNA can activate immune cells via a receptor called TLR9. The receptor triggers the cells to send signaling molecules called interferons to initiate a powerful defensive response. In people with lupus or psoriasis, these cells are activated by their own DNA, or self-DNA.  Using synchrotron X-ray scattering and other techniques, researchers determined that a broad range of molecules, both organic and inorganic, can organize self-DNA into a liquid crystalline structure that binds strongly to the TLR9 receptors   like the teeth on either side of a zipper. This structure protects the DNA from becoming degraded and greatly amplifies the body s immune response. Synchrotron X-ray scattering utilizes a particle accelerator to generate X-ray beams that allow researchers to determine how atoms and molecules are organized into different structures.  Our research has identified a set of rules that tell us what types of molecules or materials can set off this aspect of the immune system,  Wong said.  This new knowledge will make it easier to design new therapeutic strategies to control immune responses.  Nathan Schmidt, one of the paper s lead authors, said,  Our colleagues had established empirically that certain molecules were activating self-DNA and triggering responses in disorders such as lupus and psoriasis. We were able to elucidate something that was poorly understood   a key to triggering the immune response is that the molecules must arrange the DNA so that the receptors bind to them strongly.

Sounds unlikely, until you visit Charles Lieber s lab. Led by Lieber, the Mark Hyman Jr. Professor of Chemistry, an international team of researchers has developed a method of fabricating nanoscale electronic scaffolds that can be injected via syringe. The scaffolds can then be connected to devices and used to monitor neural activity, stimulate tissues, or even promote regeneration of neurons.   I do feel that this has the potential to be revolutionary,  Lieber said.  This opens up a completely new frontier where we can explore the interface between electronic structures and biology. For the past 30 years, people have made incremental improvements in micro-fabrication techniques that have allowed us to make rigid probes smaller and smaller, but no one has addressed this issue   the electronics/cellular interface   at the level at which biology works. Bright-field image showing the mesh electronics being injected through sub-100 micrometer inner diameter glass needle into aqueous solution. Image courtesy of Lieber Research Group, Harvard University In an earlier study, scientists in Lieber s lab demonstrated that cardiac or nerve cells grown with embedded scaffolds could be used to create  cyborg  tissue. Researchers were then able to record electrical signals generated by the tissue, and to measure changes in those signals as they administered cardio- or neuro-stimulating drugs.  We were able to demonstrate that we could make this scaffold and culture cells within it, but we didn t really have an idea how to insert that into pre-existing tissue,  Lieber said.  But if you want to study the brain or develop the tools to explore the brain-machine interface, you need to stick something into the body. When releasing the electronic scaffold completely from the fabrication substrate, we noticed that it was almost invisible and very flexible, like a polymer, and could literally be sucked into a glass needle or pipette. From there, we simply asked,  Would it be possible to deliver the mesh electronics by syringe needle injection?  Though not the first attempt at implanting electronics into the brain   deep brain stimulation has been used to treat a variety of disorders for decades   the nanofabricated scaffolds operate on a completely different scale.  Existing techniques are crude relative to the way the brain is wired,  Lieber said.  Whether it s a silicon probe or flexible polymers   they cause inflammation in the tissue that requires periodically changing the position or the stimulation.  But with our injectable electronics, it s as if it s not there at all. They are one million times more flexible than any state-of-the-art flexible electronics and have subcellular feature sizes. They re what I call  neuro-philic    they actually like to interact with neurons.  The process for fabricating the scaffolds is similar to that used to etch microchips, and begins with a dissolvable layer deposited on a substrate. To create the scaffold, researchers lay out a mesh of nanowires sandwiched in layers of organic polymer. The first layer is then dissolved, leaving the flexible mesh, which can be drawn into a needle and administered like any other injection. The input-output of the mesh can then be connected to standard measurement electronics so that the integrated devices can be addressed and used to stimulate or record neural activity.  These type of things have never been done before, from both a fundamental neuroscience and medical perspective,  Lieber said.  It s really exciting   there are a lot of potential applications.  Going forward, researchers hope to better understand how the body reacts to the injectable electronics over longer periods.  The idea of being able to precisely position and record from very specific areas, or even from specific neurons over an extended period of time   this could, I think, make a huge impact on neuroscience,  Lieber said.","Published: June 10, 2015"

Overall, the study indicated people born in May had the lowest disease risk, and those born in October the highest.  This data could help scientists uncover new disease risk factors,  said study senior author Nicholas Tatonetti, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and Columbia s Data Science Institute. The researchers plan to replicate their study with data from several other locations in the U.S. and abroad to see how results vary with the change of seasons and environmental factors in those places. By identifying what s causing disease disparities by birth month, the researchers hope to figure out how they might close the gap.This data visualization maps the statistical relationship between birth month and disease incidence in the electronic records of 1.7 million New York City patients. (Credit: Dr. Nick Tatonetti) Earlier research on individual diseases such as ADHD and asthma suggested a connection between birth season and incidence, but no large-scale studies had been undertaken. This motivated Columbia s scientists to compare 1,688 diseases against the birth dates and medical histories of 1.7 million patients treated at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/CUMC between 1985 and 2013. The study ruled out more than 1,600 associations and confirmed 39 links previously reported in the medical literature. The researchers also uncovered 16 new associations, including nine types of heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. The researchers performed statistical tests to check that the 55 diseases for which they found associations did not arise by chance.  It s important not to get overly nervous about these results because even though we found significant associations the overall disease risk is not that great,  notes Dr. Tatonetti.  The risk related to birth month is relatively minor when compared to more influential variables like diet and exercise.  The new data are consistent with previous research on individual diseases. For example, the study authors found that asthma risk is greatest for July and October babies. An earlier Danish study on the disease found that the peak risk was in the months (May and August) when Denmark s sunlight levels are similar to New York s in the July and October period. For ADHD, the Columbia data suggest that around one in 675 occurrences could relate to being born in New York in November. This result matches a Swedish study showing peak rates of ADHD in November babies. The researchers also found a relationship between birth month and nine types of heart disease, with people born in March facing the highest risk for atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and mitral valve disorder. One in 40 atrial fibrillation cases may relate to seasonal effects for a March birth. A previous study using Austrian and Danish patient records found that those born in months with higher heart disease rates March through June had shorter life spans.  Faster computers and electronic health records are accelerating the pace of discovery,  said the study s lead author, Mary Regina Boland, a graduate student at Columbia.  We are working to help doctors solve important clinical problems using this new wealth of data. ","Published: June 10, 2015"

""Protein phosphorylation is a central regulatory mechanism for functions within the normal cells and biological processes in the body, while disruption of phosphorylation can lead to the initiation of a variety of diseases including cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine and cancer,  says Ken Greis, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Cancer Biology, member of both the UC Cancer Institute and the Cincinnati Cancer Center and co-author on the study. ""Studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of phosphorylation have come to the forefront of biological research as the research community attempts to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms of disease with the goal of providing new targets for therapeutic intervention.  Greis says the study of cellular phosphorylation of proteins (or phosphoproteomics) is typically done by separating and categorizing the proteins by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Enrichment by adding metal materials is needed to help with this separation.  ""Mesoporous titania particles  are widely used for phosphopeptide enrichment but are expensive and offer very limited opportunities for improvement in function,  he continues. ""Titanium dioxide (commonly known as titania) nanotubes grown on titanium wire have shown promising characteristics for phosphopeptide separation. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of nanotubes on titanium wire for phosphoproteomics research.  Researchers used titanium wire based titania nanotubes and compared results when commercial particles were used on a set of known standard phosphopeptides and then on hundreds of phoshophopeptides derived from animal liver tissue.  ""Our studies revealed that the titania nanotubes on metal wire provide comparable efficacy for enrichment of phosphopeptides and easier use when compared to the particles. This could reduce costs and be a more effective method for future studies,  Greis says. ""The ability to vary the length and the size of the nanotubes also opens the door to further development of the enrichment technology. This is truly an exciting collaboration which also highlights the benefit of scientific interactions across disciplines.   ""This interaction was initiated by a discussion between postdocs at the two institutions and has blossomed into a fruitful collaboration with professor Oomman Varghese, who is a leading expert in technologies, to generate and develop titanium nanotubes for use as chemical sensors and for solar energy conversion technologies at the University of Houston. Now, we are combining our expertise to design and test new enrichment materials to further enhance our understanding of phosphorylation changes in disease to help us in the fight against cancer and other maladies.

DLX1008 is a monovalent anti-VEGF-A antibody fragment that binds with 20-30 picomolar affinity to both human as well as mouse VEGF-A. VEGF-A is a key mediator of neo-angiogenesis promoting tumor growth by enhancing the supply of the tumor mass with nutrients and oxygen. DLX1008 shows superiority to Avastin , an anti-VEGF-A IgG antibody, and Lucentis , an anti-VEGF-A Fab antibody fragment, in the inhibition of VEGF-A binding to VEGF-R1 in ELISA by a factor of around 10 and 15, respectively. Glioblastomas are the most common primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Despite significant research efforts and a large number of clinical trials during the past decades, limited progress has been made to improve the lethal prognosis of this disease where angiogenesis mediated by VEGF-A is a hallmark. A team led by Prof. Michael Weller from the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Switzerland, demonstrated that DLX1008 is highly potent in an in vitro tube formation assay based on human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. In vivo, DLX1008 significantly improved survival in a mouse orthotopic U87 xenograft model and significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse subcutaneous U87 xenograft model compared to controls. Prof. Weller said that ""these data warrant further clinical development of DLX1008 in a biomarker-driven approach to glioblastoma.

The researchers revealed that increasing levels of a certain key protein successfully protected against cell death in both genetic and sporadic versions of the disease. What's more, treating this pathway may also have implications for frontotemporal dementia because many of the same proteins are involved. ALS, a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, leads to paralysis and death due to the loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. A primary feature of ALS is an accumulation of the protein TDP43, too much of which is toxic to cells. In the current study, published in the journal PNAS, the researchers identified another protein, hUPF1, that keeps TDP43 in check, thereby preventing cell death. ""TDP43 is a 'Goldilocks' protein: too much, or too little, can cause cellular damage,"" says first author Sami Barmada, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School and former post-doctoral fellow at Gladstone. ""Over 90% of ALS cases exhibit TDP43-based pathology, so developing a treatment that keeps protein levels just right is imperative."" Previous investigations had identified hUPF1 as a potential therapeutic target for ALS, but it was unclear how this protein prevented cell death. In the current study, the scientists tested hUPF1's ability to protect against neurodegeneration using a cellular model of ALS. They discovered that genetically increasing levels of hUPF1 extended neuron survival by 50-60%. Digging deeper, the researchers revealed that hUPF1 acts through a cellular surveillance system called nonsense mediated decay, or NMD, to keep TDP43 levels stable and enhance neuronal survival. This protective mechanism (NMD) monitors messenger RNA (mRNA). If a piece of mRNA is found to be defective, it is destroyed so that it cannot go on to produce dysfunctional proteins that can harm the cell. It now appears that NMD also helps control the levels of proteins, like TDP43, that bind to RNA and regulate splicing. Since hUPF1 is a master regulator of NMD, altering it has a trickle-down effect on TDP43 and other related proteins. ""Cells have developed a really elegant way to maintain homeostasis and protect themselves from faulty proteins,"" says senior author Steven Finkbeiner, MD, PhD, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease. ""This is the first time we've been able to link this natural monitoring system to neurodegenerative disease. Leveraging this system could be a strategic therapeutic target for diseases like ALS and frontotemporal dementia."" The scientists say the next step is to develop a drug that can target NMD--by manipulating hUPF1 or through other proteins that affect this system--to influence levels of TDP43 and protect neurons.

Like a health-care worker keeping tabs on a patient's blood pressure, the finger-like appendages of astrocytes, called endfeet, quite literally wrap around the countless, fragile blood vessels in the brain, constantly monitoring what's going on inside and around them, said Dr. Jessica A. Filosa, neurovascular physiologist in the Department of Physiology at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents University. Filosa calls astrocytes ""housekeepers"" and the new findings indicate that, when they sense a change in blood pressure inside the fragile parenchymal arterioles, one of their many duties is releasing signals that help dilate or constrict the blood vessels, whichever it takes to maintain the healthy status quo. ""This is the first evidence of the astrocyte's role in pressure-induced myogenic (muscle) tone, which is keeping things regular,"" said Filosa, corresponding author of the study in The Journal of Neuroscience. In fact, astrocytes keep their fingers on the pulse of blood vessels and neurons simultaneously, apparently playing an important role in balancing their needs. ""They are perfect bridges between what is going on with neuronal activity and blood flow changes to the brain,"" Filosa said. Still the new study suggests that, even if the neurons are not in need of an adjustment to accommodate a changing demand for energy and oxygen, astrocytes relentlessly monitor and respond to changes in pressure in the parenchymal arterioles to help keep the brain from getting too much blood. ""It actually requires active astrocytes to maintain a constant tone,"" Filosa said. Astrocyte activity is driven by changes in the cell's internal calcium levels: usually an increased calcium level means increased activity. Scientists used a model that enabled them to perfuse the parenchymal arterioles in a brain slice. When they increased pressure inside the blood vessels, they constricted as they should, which triggered an increase in the astrocytes' intracellular calcium levels that enabled the cells to help the blood vessels maintain a healthy vascular tone. When scientists reduced available calcium inside astrocytes, through a process called chelation, the parenchymal arterioles still responded to changes in pressure, but could not hold a consistent tone without the support of the astrocyte endfeet. ""We want to maintain pressure and flow within normal ranges,"" she said. ""You can think of the concept of maintaining something that is constant, something that is always going on in your blood vessels and in your brain."" This basal control gets overridden in a time- and region-specific manner by task-evoked increases in blood flow needed to, for example, memorize a poem, read a scientific study, or do brain surgery. However, Filosa notes that the majority of the brain's energy goes toward maintaining resting brain activity that enables basics such as breathing and walking. Calling fragile parenchymal arterioles ""astrocyte-coated"" is no exaggeration since about 99 percent of their outside surface is literally covered by endfeet, which have the look of spider webs, Filosa said. ""You don't want to damage these vessels."" Filosa notes that chronic stress, such as high blood pressure, can actually damage multiple layers of protection, leaving fragile parenchymal arterioles rigid and unable to do their jobs and astrocytes without their supportive, responsive grip. Too much blood flow or too high pressure in the brain can result in swelling, hemorrhage and/or stroke and leave the brain more vulnerable to ischemia and infection. Too much calcium in astrocytes also has been associated with neurodegenerative maladies such as Alzheimer's. Next steps include figuring out what effect activating astrocytes has on neuronal activity, so Dr. Ki Jung Kim, postdoctoral fellow and first author on the current study, is now recording from neurons as they change pressure inside blood vessels. The brain is one of the body's most vascular organs. The subtly pulsing carotid arteries on either side of the neck are essentially where the brain's vascular system starts. The carotids come together at the base of the brain to form the Circle of Willis, and branches off that structure give rise to smaller, muscular extracerebral blood vessels that eventually cover the surface of the brain. These muscular vessels, also called resistance cells, branch many times, shedding all but one smooth muscle cell layer as they dive into the brain tissue to become parenchymal arterioles. Astrocytes have connections that reach all the way back to the muscular extracerebral blood vessels. She notes that the sturdy, extracerebral blood vessels also play an important role in pressure control and vascular tone inside the brain. As examples, when anger or terror cause a sharp increase in blood pressure in the body, these big vessels will constrict to prevent sudden changes in cerebral blood flow and prevent large pressure changes from reaching fragile parenchymal arterioles. Even routine changes in blood pressure, such as those that take place in the simple act of standing, require these adjustments. Filosa notes, that when you stand up real fast, the reason you may feel dizzy is, in part, because astrocytes and smooth muscles didn't have enough time to make their respective proper adjustments.

The study - the first to document that sleep originates in small neural networks - opens the door to deeper understanding of the genetic, molecular and electrical aspects underlying sleep disorders. WSU Regents professor James Krueger and doctoral student Kathryn Jewett cultured neurons and glial cells that matured over two weeks into active neural networks exhibiting some of the same EEG sleep patterns seen in the brains of animals. The networks are the simplest unit of sleep identified to date. Krueger predicted 20 years ago that sleep originates in small networks of neurons and glia. He said this study supports the hypothesis and will allow sleep to be independently isolated for research without the intrusion of physiological factors like changing body temperature. The findings were recently published in the European Journal of Neuroscience. The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke and the National Science Foundation. Sleep clinics typically use EEG (electroencephalogram) measurements such as slow wave voltage (SW) and synchronization (SYN) to determine if a patient has fallen asleep. For the study, Krueger and Jewett used a number of readings including SW and SYN to determine sleep states of the mature cell cultures. Krueger said the normal state of cultured neurons is sleep-like. To drive them into deeper sleep, the researchers added tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to the petri dish, which also contained an array of EEG electrodes. TNF is an immune protein that helps regulate sleep and is found in all animals from fruit flies to humans. ""TNF is also known to stabilize synapses - the junction between two neurons - so you don't lose old memories and can simultaneously retain new memories,"" he said. Krueger and Jewett reversed the effects of TNF and awakened the neurons by applying mild electrical stimulation. During this period, the cells displayed EEG signs equivalent to wakeful activity. When the researchers prolonged electrical stimulation, the cells responded with a miniature version of sleep homeostasis seen in animals; that is, after their extra activity, the nerve cells ""slept in"" the next day. ""Everyone has experienced this type of homeostasis,"" said Krueger. ""If you stay up late one night, you sleep more the next night to catch up."" The researchers said the pathway for this sleep-wake cycle is consistent with the way sleep occurs in life. When the neuron cultures are activated they signal that activity by releasing ATP, which in turn releases TNF and another immune hormone called interleukin-1. Together they trigger the sleep phase. The study builds on the work of former WSU neuroscientist David Rector who, in 2005, showed that individual cortical columns in the brain go to sleep and wake up at different times. His research confirmed that after a day of unusual exertion certain parts of the brain will continue sleeping the next day. In effect, you really can be ""half asleep."" Rector and Krueger also showed that a cortical column could be driven into a sleep-like state by the application of TNF. Krueger said that although it is late in his 40-year career, his discovery of the neural networks is opening up exciting new fields in sleep research and will help address the elusive mystery of sleep function. ""It is forcing scientists to see sleep as a small network property,"" he said. ""Before, people viewed sleep as a whole-brain phenomenon - using theories that often invoke, ""a miracle occurs and then you go to sleep."" ""In our theory, there is no miracle at all,"" said Krueger. ""Bits and pieces of the brain oscillate between sleep and wake-like states depending on how much activity they had the day before. ""And the reason they do that is because synapses are activity dependent - the more you use them, the better they get,"" he said. ""While our bodies rest, sleep stabilizes the neural network and provides an alternate pattern of stimulation to help preserve our memories.""

The results reinforce the observation that patients with a shorter duration of symptoms, and a younger age at implantation, experience better outcomes, said Fabi n Piedimonte, M.D., FIPP, of the Argentinean chapter of the International Neuromodulation Society   Sociedad Argentina de Neuromodulaci n (SANE), the CENIT Foundation, and Buenos Aires Provincial Program of Neuromodulation. The study is being presented as an oral abstract at the 12th World Congress by co-author and SANE President Juan Carlos Andreani, M.D., of the CENIT Foundation and Buenos Aires Provincial Program of Neuromodulation. Dystonia is considered the third most-common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson s disease. Its symptoms include twisting and repetitive motions or abnormal posture, which can be frustrating and painful. While there are many types and causes, one of the most severe types of dystonia can begin in childhood and become severe before the end of the teen years. Previous experience in Parkinson s disease has suggested that if conservative measures do not adequately control dystonia symptoms, deep brain stimulation to the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) may be effective. The study being reported today confirms growing evidence that deep brain stimulation to the Gpi is most effective in patients with primary dystonia (not secondary to some other condition or lesion), particularly in patients with primary dystonia who have a hereditary component, and carry the DYT1 mutation. The 16 patients in the study were treated at medical centers in Buenos Aires. Their average age of onset was 9 years old (between 1   14 years of age); the median age at surgery was 12 years (between 8   19 years of age). On average, patients  motor symptoms improved 69 percent and their disability sub-scores improved 60 percent. Some patients saw complete symptom relief. In four of the 16 patients, the motor-symptom improvement was less than 50 percent. Half of those patients did not carry the DYTI mutation. The patients were seen every few months to adjust their stimulation parameters, since the natural evolution of the disease can cause new symptoms to develop. The pediatric patients were operated on under general anesthesia in a single-stage procedure, using microelectrode recordings to map the best path to guide the stimulation leads to the stimulation target structure. As rechargeable pulse generators became available, they were preferentially used to provide the therapeutic stimulation, since they do not require replacement surgery every few years. n dystonia, initial symptom relief from deep brain stimulation appears in weeks, with settings being optimized over the first two or three months. The best relief generally develops during the first year post-surgery. In addition to helping reduce patients  symptoms, other important benefits of adequately managing dystonia include allowing the children s bones to continue growth with less risk of deformity from ongoing muscle contraction, and enabling ease of hygiene through better voluntary movement.

Previous studies have shown that psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, tend to be found in the same families where creative professions are common. However, until now it had not been possible to pinpoint whether this was simply due to shared environmental factors or socioeconomic status.Although creativity is difficult to define for scientific purposes, researchers consider a creative person to be someone who takes novel approaches requiring cognitive processes that are different from prevailing modes of thought or expression. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are disorders of thoughts and emotions, which means that those affected show alterations in cognitive and emotional processing.  Genetic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were examined in a sample of 86,292 individuals from the general population of Iceland, in collaboration with researchers from deCODE Genetics, who provided the data. In the study, published in Nature Neuroscience, creative individuals were defined as those belonging to the national artistic societies of actors, dancers, musicians, visual artists and writers.  Researchers found that genetic risk scores for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were significantly higher in those defined as creative individuals, with scores approximately halfway between the general population and those with the disorders themselves.  These findings lend support to the direct influence of genetic factors on creativity, as opposed to the effect of sharing an environment with individuals who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Robert Power, first author from the MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre at the IoPPN, said: ""For most psychiatric disorders little is known about the underlying biological pathways that lead to illness. An idea that has gained credibility is that these disorders reflect extremes of the normal spectrum of human behaviour, rather than a distinct psychiatric illness. By knowing which healthy behaviours, such as creativity, share their biology with psychiatric illnesses we gain a better understanding of the thought processes that lead a person to become ill and how the brain might be going wrong.""  Our findings suggest that creative people may have a genetic predisposition towards thinking differently which, when combined with other harmful biological or environmental factors, could lead to mental illness.

Schwartz, a professor of genetics and chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To make his point, he brings his face close to the table where he sits - his mosaic for the purpose of illustration - and describes the details of each imaginary tile.  ""I can get an accounting of the tiles,"" he says, ""but I can't see the whole picture because I can't step back far enough."" In a new study published Schwartz and his research team, spearheaded by recently minted Ph.D. Aditya Gupta, describe a new approach for studying the cancer genome that Schwartz says will let scientists account for both the individual tiles and the whole mosaic. It enables researchers and clinicians to look at the small- and large-scale genetic changes that define individual cancers.Researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison By using the approach in the study, the researchers describe unique genomic features of a tumor from a patient with multiple myeloma and identify potential new drug targets for the treatment of this incurable blood cancer.  ""Cancer genomes are complicated but we found that, using an approach like this, you can begin to understand them at every level,"" Schwartz says. Put another way, the approach is like creating a Google Maps for cancer. It could allow scientists and clinicians to zoom in for a ""street view"" of individual changes in the genetic alphabet of cancer, or zoom out for a more Google Earth-style perspective of whole genome changes and everything in between. It could allow them to examine changes in a patient's cancer over the progression of the illness, monitor for signs of drug resistance, and fine-tune treatments, Schwartz says.  While the study does not carry statistical power - only one patient's tumor was analyzed - it opens the door for others to test what the researchers found. It also demonstrates the potential of the approach, which combines a system Schwartz invented, called optical mapping, with more traditional genetic tools like DNA sequencing. ""The approach allows an intimate view of a cancer genome,"" he says. ""You get to see it, you get to measure it, and you get to see it evolve at many levels. This is what we should be doing with every cancer genome and the goal here is to make the system fast enough so this becomes a routine tool."" The genome is the full complement of DNA of an individual plant, animal, human, or cancer cell, including the genes and all of the material in between (which was once erroneously called junk DNA). The cancer genome is riddled with mutations that render it not only different from the rest of the cells in the human body but also often harmful. Multiple myeloma in particular is characterized by widespread changes in the genome over the course of disease, says study co-author, Fotis Asimakopoulos, professor of medicine and a multiple myeloma researcher and physician at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health. In the approach, researchers obtained tumorous and noncancerous samples from a patient with multiple myeloma at two different times: at a stage of illness where the cancer was responsive to drug treatment and after it had progressed and was resistant to chemotherapy.  They performed standard DNA sequencing to read each of the single letters spelling out the genomic code of the cancer, yielding small pieces of information like the individual tiles of a mosaic, or the zoomed-in section of a map. Then, isolating individual DNA molecules from the cancer, the researchers performed optical mapping in a unique facility at the UW-Madison Biotechnology Center, where Schwartz is also affiliated. In that system - which Schwartz used as part of the team that first elucidated the complex genome of maize in 2009 - single strands of DNA are stretched out and placed in a special device. The strands are given specific landmarks, like tabs in a book, and marked with a fluorescent dye. An automated system takes images of each of these marked segments, cataloging the molecules barcode-like into large datasets that are then pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle to provide a zoomable view of a genome. The research team then layered the two together, assembling the ""tiles"" from DNA sequencing and then stepping back to see the full mural with optical mapping, providing a comprehensive view of the patient's multiple myeloma genome. ""It's a rare, near-complete characterization of the complexity of a myeloma genome, from the smallest variance all the way to big chunks of chromosomal material that differ between the tumor DNA and the normal DNA of the patient,"" Asimakopoulos says. Schwartz says the approach allowed them to see that, compared to the patient's noncancerous genome, and across the two cancer time points, the multiple myeloma genome was marked by an increase in notable mutations and larger-scale changes. Not only were there more unusual tiles in the mosaic (mutations) as the cancer progressed, but whole sections of tiles were removed, flipped around, or even inserted.  ""Accounting for individual tiles wouldn't tell you anything about that and that's why you need a comprehensive view,"" he says. ""You want every single base, but you also want the local and global order as correct as possible, and that's what we've done here."" In the study, the researchers highlight the changes they believe are most worthy of further exploration and that yield the greatest potential for future therapies. While new drug treatments have improved the survival rate for patients with multiple myeloma in recent decades, the cancer almost always becomes resistant to treatment, leading to poor outcomes for patients over time. The researchers hope this approach could help prevent drug resistance altogether, or help scientists and physicians develop ways to work around it. ""To cure myeloma, we need to understand how genomes evolve with progression and treatment,"" says Asimakopoulos. ""The more we can understand the drivers in cancer in significant depth, and in each individual, the better we can tailor treatment to each patient's disease biology."" We have entered an era focused on more personalized, precision medicine, both he and Schwartz say, and this approach is a step toward better achieving that. Asimakopoulos is taking some of the findings from the study back to his lab, and Schwartz would like to see the system used to map individual patient cancer genomes over the course of their disease. ""Instead of Grade 1, we can say, 'This is Joe's myeloma, and given this list of mutations and other info, this is the treatment,'"" he says. ""No two myeloma are alike."" Schwartz continues to work toward ways to advance the system, making it higher-resolution, more cost-effective and scalable. Ultimately, he'd like to build a system capable of analyzing 1,000 genomes - cancerous or otherwise - in 24 hours. He also wants to continue to build the capacity of the university to perform meaningful human studies, to harness and link the tools of physics, chemistry, biology, bioinformatics and medicine to change outcomes for patients. He sees UW-Madison becoming a national or even international center for this kind of work. ""I like to look at problems and get down and dirty; I'll a take hammer and hatchet to them, tie them up, put a match to them - anything to get an answer,"" he says. ""I just adore being able to take what we do - the physics, the microscopy, the chemistry - and use them to have a real impact on human biology."" ","Published: June 9, 2015"

The results of their research, which required combining specialties and inventing new experimental techniques, should help scientists better understand how cells convey information through Notch signaling.  Notch is important for processes such as determining cell fate during embryonic development. In addition, mutations of the gene encoding Notch are found in some diseases, including more than half of all cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The study could therefore inform researchers  understanding of what is going wrong in such diseases, said co-corresponding author Joseph Loparo, assistant professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School. The tools the team created should help scientists investigate the role physical force plays in regulating a variety of biological systems.  Knowing that this ancient system for cell-cell communication has built into it a dependence on mechanical force has relevance to the fundamental question of how Notch signaling guides normal developmental decisions in multicellular organisms, and should provide insight into mutations that likely bypass the force requirement in disease,  said Stephen Blacklow, the Gustavus Adolphus Pfeiffer Professor and chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at HMS, who led the study with Loparo.  I am excited that our work provides new insights into Notch signaling, and we hope that the tools we developed will be useful to our colleagues in the Notch signaling field,  said Wendy Gordon, who conducted the work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Blacklow lab. Gordon is now an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota.  Furthermore, altered mechanical forces in the microenvironment of cells in disease states like cancer is an emerging concept that necessitates new tools like the ones we developed to understand how other proteins on the surface of cells use mechanical force to communicate signals to the inside of cells,  she said. Before this study, researchers understood the basic order of events needed to convey a Notch message. But pieces were missing. They knew that a molecule called Delta on the surface of the  speaking  cell binds to a molecule called Notch on the surface of the  listening  cell. Then an enzyme swoops in, and, like a pair of scissors, snips off a piece of Notch, releasing the signal into the cell. Notch s  cut here  site is initially hidden. It wasn t clear how it becomes available to the enzyme scissors. Experiments showed that the mere binding of Delta and Notch molecules wasn t enough to expose it. Fifteen years ago, scientists proposed that a mechanical force might be needed. In the current study, Blacklow and Loparo s teams became the first to directly test the idea and show that it s probably correct.  You need to pull on Notch,  said Blacklow. To make their discoveries, the researchers first set up simplified Notch systems on a glass slide. They attached tiny magnetic beads to individual Notch molecules tethered to the slide and bathed them in the Notch-cutting enzymes. At first, nothing happened. Then they used what they called magnetic tweezers to pull on the beads. When they achieved enough force, the Notch molecules were cut and the beads floated away.  It was a really clever idea,  said Blacklow of Gordon s experimental design. When pulled, fluorescently tagged magnetic beads are cut free of Notch and float away. Experiment shown at 100 times normal speed. Video: Wendy GordonThe tests revealed that the force needed to reveal the cutting site was within the realm of what might occur in a real cell. The researchers pursued their findings in a second set of experiments conducted in real cells using complete Notch and Delta molecules. They confirmed that magnetically tugging at Delta within a certain range of forces revealed Notch s cutting site and released the signal without tearing apart either molecule. Finally, the researchers built synthetic alternatives to the natural Delta-Notch connections to test whether anything about the natural bond other than the pull force might help expose the cutting site.  Is it just a tether?  asked Loparo.  Or does something else in the connection lower the barrier to the door opening?  Gordon designed one synthetic system. Norbert Perrimon, the James Stillman Professor of Developmental Biology at HMS, and members of his lab designed another. Both systems showed that the pull force alone was sufficient to reveal the cutting site and release the signal. The experiments also revealed which parts of the Delta-Notch system are essential. As they slot one more piece into the puzzle of Notch signaling, the research teams look forward to exploring new questions their work has raised.  We came to this problem with two complementary areas of expertise,  said Loparo.  Neither of our labs could ve done this on their own. It s a fun and exciting way to do science.

One is called lignin, which traps sugars and starches used for biofuel production inside the tree's sturdy cell walls. The other is known as condensed tannin, and its presence in leaves and barks of the tree deters feeding by ruminants, such as deer, cattle, goats and sheep. ""CRISPR is a relatively new technology, but it could improve our ability to produce novel varieties of food crops, animal feeds and biofuel feedstocks,"" said the study's lead researcher C.J. Tsai, a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in UGA's Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and department of genetics. ""Compared to some other gene editing techniques, this is incredibly simple, cost-effective and highly efficient, and it could serve as the foundation for a new era of discovery in plant genetics."" CRISPR technology is derived from a defense mechanism evolved by bacteria and other single-celled organisms. When a bacterium is attacked by an invader like a virus, it captures some of the virus's DNA, chops it up into pieces and incorporates a segment of the viral DNA into its own genome. As the bacterium experiences more threats, it accumulates a bank of past infections in a special part of its genetic code called CRISPRs short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats which act as a kind of immune system to protect against future invasions. ""This is a mechanism that evolved naturally, but we can borrow the bacteria's gene-cutting abilities and use it to edit very specific genes in all kinds of organisms, including plants and animals,"" said Tsai, who is also director of UGA's Plant Center. ""It's like using a pair of scissors with GPS tracking to locate and snip out tiny bits of DNA--enough to nullify the gene you don't want, while leaving everything else unchanged."" Tsai credits her collaborator Thomas Jacobs, a former doctoral student in UGA's Institute of Plant Breeding, Genetics and Genomics, who adapted the CRISPR system for plant genome editing. ""Tom was a student in my class a few years back, and we were testing some of the gene silencing systems he developed for soybean in poplars,"" Tsai said. ""It was a side project, also involving Xiaohong Zhou, a visiting doctoral student from Nanjing Forestry University, to test the new CRISPR system, and its high efficiency exceeded all of our expectations."" Every single poplar plant Zhou produced from the lignin-gene-targeting experiment had red-colored wood. Red stem is a known side effect of lignin modification found in natural mutants of maize, sorghum and pine, Tsai explained, so the researchers knew the CRISPR system worked when they saw the telltale red stems on their Populus plants. ""I was blown away by the results,"" Jacobs said. ""This is one of the highest efficiencies ever reported, even in mouse and other animal models where the technology has been more extensively tested."" The modified Populus plants contained about 20% less lignin and 50% less condensed tannins than wild trees. ""We thought we knew what genes control lignin and condensed tannin production, and we did target the right genes, but the work showed us that there are other genes with overlapping roles,"" Tsai said. ""The CRISPR system can now guide researchers seeking to identify these previously unknown gene family members.""","Published: June 9, 2015"

The study, relies on the use of phages, which transfer ""edited"" DNA into resistant bacteria to kill off resistant strains and make others more sensitive to antibiotics. According to the researchers, the system, if ultimately applied to pathogens on hospital surfaces or medical personnel's hands, could turn the tide on untreatable, often lethal bacterial infections. ""Since there are only a few pathogens in hospitals that cause most of the antibiotic-resistance infections, we wish to specifically design appropriate sensitization treatments for each one of them,"" notes Udi Qimron, Ph.D., of the department of clinical microbiology and immunology at TAU's Sackler Faculty of Medicine. ""We will have to choose suitable combinations of DNA-delivering phages that would deliver the DNA into pathogens, and the suitable combination of 'killing' phages that could select the re-sensitized pathogens."" Antibiotic-resistant pathogens constitute an increasing threat because antibiotics are designed to select resistant pathogens over sensitive ones. ""The injected DNA does two things: It eliminates the genes that cause resistance to antibiotics, and it confers protection against lethal phages,  continues Dr. Qimron. ""We managed to devise a way to restore antibiotic sensitivity to drug-resistant bacteria, and also prevent the transfer of genes that create that resistance among bacteria. Earlier research by Dr. Qimron revealed that bacteria could be sensitized to certain antibiotics and that specific chemical agents could ""choose"" those bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics. His strategy harnesses the power of the CRISPR-Cas system.  We use phages for delivering a programmable DNA nuclease, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated (Cas), to reverse antibiotic resistance and eliminate the transfer of resistance between strains,  write the investigators.  This approach combines CRISPR-Cas delivery with lytic phage selection of antibiotic-sensitized bacteria. The strategy may reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in treated surfaces and on skin of medical personnel, as it uses phages in a unique way that overcomes many of the hurdles encountered by phage therapy.  Dr. Qimron and his team are now set to apply the CRISPR/phage system on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the world's most prevalent antibiotic-resistant pathogens involved in hospital-acquired infections, and to test whether bacterial sensitization works in a more complex microbial environment: the mouse cage.","Published: June 9, 2015"

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is probably the most common adhesive that offers a stick-and-play concept for device integration, allowing increased functionality. But reversible bonding is weak so researchers are looking for more secure materials. Adhesive abilities of geckos are the result of one key factor: Van der Waals forces. On their own, these forces are weak, but they exhibit significant adhesion capacities when acting over large areas. Inspired by that concept, Dan Sameoto and Abdul Wasay, from the University of Alberta, designed and manufactured a reversible system over 10 times stronger than PDMS. The difference with current techniques is in the design of the channels, which involves creating a gasket to contain the fluidics. Dry adhesive fibres of styrene ethylene butylene styrene surround this gasket, generating a mushroom shaped geometry and act as a sweep to define the path of the desired channel. Apart from acting as sidewalls, these fibres enhance net adhesion and contribute to make the whole geometry tolerant to defects and surface variation.  From a technical standpoint, the development of a process to make reliable mushroom shaped fibres was the biggest challenge,  admits Sameoto.  The infrastructure needed to apply this work is not that onerous at all and can permit very high quality structures to be produced at quite low costs.   This new adhesive technology will make complex microfluidic patterns much simpler to assemble,  says Ali Dhinojwala, from the University of Akron, US, who is also interested in mimicking the sticking power of geckos.  By incorporating mushroom-shape tips in the fabrication of the device, they demonstrate reversible seals with larger burst pressures than PDMS-based devices.  Sameoto is now exploring the full potential of this study, stressing how significant this advance is for resource-limited projects. He is confident that microfluidics processes and materials will be cheap enough someday that disposable devices could be distributed  almost like Band-Aids, sealed and sterilised, and ready to implement in point-of-care settings at a price point affordable to nearly anyone in the world.

At best, some may view microbes as quasi-helpful when they are packaged in the form of probiotic food or supplement. What if, however, we were able to use bacterial species as a diagnostic tool to detect disease?   The investigators had the idea of using concepts from synthetic biology that utilized electronics in order to construct genetic systems, making it possible to program living cells like a computer.  We report that bacterial biosensors with genetically encoded digital amplifying genetic switches can detect clinically relevant biomarkers in human urine and serum,  the authors explained.  These bactosensors perform signal digitization and amplification, multiplexed signal processing with the use of Boolean logic gates, and data storage.  Using the transistor as a model, which can act as both a switch and as a signal amplifier, the researchers quickly realized that they could construct logic gates within microorganisms. Logic gates respond to signal combinations according to a predetermined judgment, for example a dual input ""AND"" logic gate will produce a signal only if two input signals are present. The CNRS teams inserted genetic transistors, or transcriptors, into live bacteria. Transcriptors are transistor-like devices composed of DNA and RNA rather than a semiconducting material such as silicon. Insertion of one or more transcriptors into bacteria transforms them into microscopic calculators, where the electrical signals used in electronics are replaced by molecular signals that control gene expression allowing for the implantation of simple genetic programs into living cells in response to different combinations of molecules. ""We have standardized our method, and confirmed the robustness of our synthetic bacterial systems in clinical sample,  stated Alexis Courbet, graduate student at CNRS and lead author on the current study.  We have also developed a rapid technique for connecting the transcriptor to new detection systems. All this should make it easier to reuse our system."" The researchers were able to exploit the transcriptor's amplification abilities to detect disease markers, even when present in minuscule amounts. Moreover, they also succeeded in storing the results of the tests in the bacterial DNA for several months. Additionally, the investigators connected the transcriptor to a bacterial system that responds to glucose and were able to detect slight elevations of glucose within the urine of diabetic patients. ""We have deposited the genetic components used in this work in the public domain to allow their unrestricted reuse by other public or private researchers,  says J r me Bonnet, Ph.D., research investigator at Montpellier's Centre for Structural Biochemistry (CBS) and lead author on the current study.

However, despite annual surveys for E. betae prevalence little is known about the disease s diversity, its source of infection and strains that re-infect after fungicidal treatment. Sugar beet leaf showing symptoms of powdery mildew (left) - grey-white mycelium and (right) - Rust (Uromyces betae) - orange/brown pustules Following a successful proposal, titled:  Discovering the source of sugar beet infection and re-infection by Erysiphe betae , the British Beet Research Organisation (BBRO) granted TGAC the funding to, quantify the diversity of the UK E. betae species, determine the source of infection of the sugar beet crop, and identify the effects of fungicidal application on pathogen genetic diversity. The research project will use a hundred E. betae genome sequences from both an agricultural and wild setting, contributed via the BBRO and wider sugar beet industry, and will analyse the pathogen to design genetic markers that will be used in a rapid detection technology to identify infection in sugar beet species.  This will be accompanied by the generation of a draft genome assembly of a secondary beet pathogen, the rust Uromyces beticola, which will allow the research team to gain further insight into the sugar beet pathogen, answering questions regarding its size and complexity, and informing potential follow-up studies. Dr Mark McMullan, Population & Evolutionary Biologist in the Plant & Microbial Genomics Group at TGAC, said:  Evolution of powdery mildew in the wild may drive adaptation to crop hosts and cause losses in agriculture. By analysing the population genetics of pathogens that span both wild and agricultural ecosystems we hope to shed light on the causes of sugar beet infection and also on the causes of agricultural host-pathogen evolution.  Priorities in the sugar beet industry are to protect and promote sugar beet yield and performance and an important part of this objective is to decrease yield losses caused by fungal pathogens.  Currently, the main treatments for E. betae, are the triazole/strobilurin fungicides which are currently under scrutiny, due to concerns of their effects on the human endocrine system. Alternatives to widespread fungicide treatment are: targeted fungicidal applications and optimal deployment of current resistant cultivars via improved disease forecasting and identification of pathogen reservoirs. Dr Matthew Clark, Plant & Microbial Genomics Group Leader, said:  Wild plants can often be a reservoir of agricultural diseases especially important if it s where they complete their life cycle. A better understanding the biology of E. betae and how modern agriculture is affecting it could enable better land management to minimise yield loss, pesticide use and harm to the environment.  Understanding the diversity of a pathogen population can improve development of resistant cultivars, facilitate treatment programmes and allow the identification of new infectious strains. Studying the diversity of E.betae strains will inform resistance trials and allow for the future development of targeted treatment of possible virulent strains.  Identification of genetic variation will enable the researchers to design DNA markers for an infield detection system using an isothermal DNA amplification system from TwistDx as a diagnostic tool. Knowing the source of the E. betae agricultural outbreak will inform surveillance and treatment decisions to reduce fungicide treatment. By analysing E. betae species that infect both before and after fungicidal treatment will identify those that are more resistant to current treatment strategies.  E. betae genome sequencing is especially favourable because of the recent release of the sugar beet genome sequence. Together, these genomic resources are valuable tools for the future discovery of novel resistance genes for E. betae infection and improved sugar beet varieties. Dr Lawrence Percival-Alwyn, Research Associate in Plant & Microbial Genomics at TGAC, added:  Currently it s unknown how fungicidal treatment affects the success of different E.betae strains. By sequencing strains that infect prior to and those that re-emerge following fungicidal treatment, we hope to identify those strains that are more resistant to current treatments. With greater insight into the mode of infection and progression of E. betae on the sugar beet crop, combined with strain specific identification in the form of a diagnostic assay, the ultimate goal is to inform disease management strategy and potentially introduce targeted treatment programmes.  TGAC s research has the potential to lead to the development of markers for an infield diagnostic test for Erysiphe betae. Scientists will develop two types of DNA-based diagnostic tests, lab-based and infield based test kits using the TwistDx technology. ","Published: June 9, 2015"

With VirScan, researchers can run a single test to determine which viruses have infected an individual, rather than limiting their analysis to particular viruses. That unbiased approach could uncover unexpected factors affecting individual patients' health, and also expands opportunities to analyze and compare viral infections in large populations. The analysis reportedly can be performed for about $25 per blood sample.  We've developed a screening methodology to basically look back in time in people's sera and see what viruses they have experienced,  says Stephen J. Elledge, an HHMI investigator at Brigham and Women's Hospital who led an international team that developed VirScan.  Instead of testing for one individual virus at a time, which is labor intensive, we can assay all of these at once. It's one-stop shopping.  Dr. Elledge and his colleagues have already used VirScan to screen the blood of 569 people in the U.S., South Africa, Thailand, and Peru.  VirScan works by screening the blood for antibodies against any of the 206 species of viruses known to infect humans. The immune system produces pathogen-specific antibodies when it encounters a virus for the first time, and it can continue to make those antibodies for years or decades after it clears an infection. That means VirScan not only identifies viral infections that the immune system is actively fighting, but also provides a history of an individual's past infections. To develop the new test, Elledge and his colleagues synthesized more than 93,000 short pieces of DNA encoding different segments of viral proteins. They introduced those pieces of DNA into bacteriophage. Each bacteriophage manufactured one of the peptides and displayed the peptide on its surface. As a group, the bacteriophage displayed all of the protein sequences found in the more than 1,000 known strains of human viruses. Antibodies in the blood find their viral targets by recognizing unique features known as epitopes that are embedded in proteins on the virus surface. To perform the VirScan analysis, all of the peptide-displaying bacteriophage are allowed to mingle with a blood sample. Antiviral antibodies in the blood find and bind to their target epitopes within the displayed peptides. The scientists then retrieve the antibodies and wash away everything except for the few bacteriophage that cling to them. By sequencing the DNA of those bacteriophage, they can identify which viral protein pieces were grabbed onto by antibodies in the blood sample. That tells the scientists which viruses a person's immune system has previously encountered, either through infection or through vaccination. Dr. Elledge estimates it would take about 2 3 days to process 100 samples, assuming sequencing is working optimally. He is optimistic the speed of the assay will increase with further development. Dr. Elledge says the approach his team has developed is not limited to antiviral antibodies. His own lab is also using it to look for antibodies that attack a body's own tissue in certain autoimmune diseases that are associated with cancer. A similar approach could also be used to screen for antibodies against other types of pathogens.","Published: June 9, 2015"

These particular fungi, best known as a cause of yeast infections and oral thrush, can be lethal if they overgrow and invade the bloodstream from the gut. At high risk for this type of infection are stem cell transplant and leukemia patients whose immune systems are suppressed during treatment. Up to 25 percent of cancer patients develop bloodstream infections from bacteria or fungi.  For a cancer patient with a Candida bloodstream infection, the fatality rate is about 30 percent. Candida is the No. 1 fungal pathogen,  said senior author Dr. Andrew Koh, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Microbiology, and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. Certain antibiotics do fight invasive Candida infection, but they are not always effective and antibiotic resistance increasingly has become an issue. Dr. Koh s research team aimed to uncover how the body s natural immune defense system might be enhanced to fight a Candida infection. About half of the population carries Candida in the gut, where the yeast is usually harmless. When the organism overgrows, it may leave the gut and cause infection. Commensal bacteria, the resident bacteria of the gut, normally defend against disease by inhibiting growth of potentially pathogenic organisms. By studying how mice infected with Candida responded in different scenarios, the researchers discovered how to enhance the body s natural ability to eradicate infection, in this case Candida.  The commensal bacteria stimulate gut tissue to make a transcription factor and a natural antibiotic, which then kills the Candida fungus,  said Dr. Koh, Director of the Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Program at UT Southwestern and Children s Medical Center Dallas.  When we gave the mice a pharmacologic agent called L-mimosine that stimulates the transcription factor, the agent knocked down Candida 100-fold, which translated into a 50 percent reduction in mortality from invasive Candida infection.  Specifically, the researchers found that enhancing the transcription factor HIF-1  with L-mimosine led to increased production of the natural antibiotic peptide LL-37, which in turn killed the fungi. L-mimosine is a natural product derived from seeds of the koa haole tree that is not approved as a drug but is known to boost HIF-1  activity. The study also suggested that certain gut bacteria   Cloistridial Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes - may be important in producing short-chain fatty acids that help fight infection. More study is needed to pinpoint the optimal method of inducing the body s gut defense system, whether through use of an agent like L-mimosine or by administering short-chain fatty acids such as vinegar.  Can we modulate the gut system to maintain balance so that it never gets to the point of pathogens invading the bloodstream?  asked Dr. Koh.  Boosting GI mucosal immune effectors to reduce fungal burden may be the key to tipping the balance back toward normal and preventing invasive fungal disease. ","Published: June 9, 2015"

A collaboration of researchers in Japan has now demonstrated a technique for simultaneously mapping the morphology as well as electronic and bonding states on fuel cell electrode membranes for the first time. The results show how the catalysts on the membrane electrodes degrade and provide insights for improving the durability. Yasuhiro Iwasawa and colleagues from the University of Electro-Communications, the University of Tokushima and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute studied proton exchange membrane fuel cells based on Nafion - an ion-containing polymer (ionomer) widely used for these devices. In their report of the results they point out how they might expect the non-uniform distribution of catalytic platinum nanoparticles to lead to non-uniform degradation throughout the fuel cell. As a result spatially resolved imaging of the membrane and catalytic platinum chemical species is key to determining how to reduce the deterioration of the catalyst, and hence improve the durability. The researchers combined scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques with X-ray absorption fine structure measurements (XAFS).  The STEM/EDS can give morphological information on atomic arrangement and element distribution, while the nano-XAFS can give molecular-level chemical information on electronic (oxidation) states and coordination structures with chemical bonding,  they explain in their report of the work. By using their same-view STEM/EDS and XAFS equipment to compare the membranes before and after 300 cycles of gas exchange, they were able to identify two processes causing irreversible degradation of the platinum catalyst: detachment of the platinum nanoparticles from the carbon support and the formation of platinum ions. Further they found that these processes were dependent on the ratios of platinum and ionomer. Background Proton exchange membrane fuel cellsFuel cells produce electrical energy from hydrogen and an oxidizing agent such as oxygen or air. Catalysts cause the hydrogen molecules to break up into positive ions - that is, protons - and electrons. The proton exchange membrane allows the protons to pass through but the electrons follow an external circuit to the anode to complete the circuit, providing electricity (electric current).Nafion was the first reported ion-containing polymer or ionomer. It has attracted a great deal of interest for fuel cells because of its high thermal and mechanical stability. Electron microscopyThe resolving power of traditional optical microscopes is limited by the diffraction limit to around half the wavelength of the incident light. The resolving power of electron microscopes is much greater because the wavelength associated with the electron beams used is up to several orders of magnitude shorter than optical light. Electron microscope images are derived from the changes in the electron beam after it is transmitted through the sample. By scanning the beam across the sample scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images are achieved. STEM images provide atomic-scale information about the shape and contours of a sample. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopyThe electron beam can also stimulate the emission of x-rays from a sample. The wavelength of the x-rays emitted is determined by the atomic structure, which is specific to each individual element. As a result, measuring the peaks in the x-ray spectra - energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) - can identify the elements in STEM images. X-ray absorption fine structureWhen a sample is irradiated with a beam of x-rays, some pass through and some are absorbed at specific wavelengths depending on the binding energy of the electrons in the sample. Identifying these binding energies in this way gives an indication of the molecular-level chemical information on electronic (oxidation) states and coordination structures with chemical bonding. Same-view cellThe researchers produced a  same-view  membrane cell that allows the simultaneous view of both chemical distribution by STEM and bonding states by nano-XAFS in fuel cell membranes. By combining the information in these imaging techniques in the  same-view  cell in this way they could monitor and locate the movement and ionization of the catalytic platinum nanoparticles that deteriorates the fuel cell.","Published: June 9, 2015"

By sampling a suspect s personal items, law enforcement might have the ability to determine a person s previous locations and movements by examining microbial communities that have been left behind. ""Human microbial signatures have already been used to match individuals to objects they've interacted with, such as computer keyboards,  said researcher, Simon Lax, who coauthored the study.  We found that even moving from one's own living room to a friend's living room leads to a highly detectable shift in microbial community structure on an individual's personal items.  Participants in the study used a sterile swab to sample the soles of the shoes and the floor beneath them, as well as the front and back of their cell phones over a two-day period. Swabbing every hour, the participants recorded their exact location throughout the day, giving researchers an unprecedented look into the microbial communities beneath our feet. The study only consisted of two participants, and the need for further research is evident. ""Microbial forensics is an emerging field and many more studies are needed to better understand its potential utility,  Lax said in the article. The field needs a lot more research to even determine if it can be viable. The study said that microbial forensic evidence could last at a crime scene that remained at room temperature for up to two weeks. How long until that evidence might be admitted in a court of law is obviously unknown, although even the most generate estimates are still probably over a decade.  This current study is a small pilot, and so a major priority will be scaling up the number of individuals in these sorts of studies,   said Lax,  and seeing if we're still able to match people to objects with high precision.""","Published: June 9, 2015"

The alliance is a partnership between Illumina, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Genea, which develops innovative fertility technologies. The alliance aims to improve the consistency in ART worldwide and addresses the need for more standardization of fertility processes within the ART laboratory. The three companies will launch their initiative at the 31st Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Lisbon, Portugal, on 13 June 2015. This is another important step for Illumina towards establishing global standards in the growing market of fertility technologies and the ultimate goal of helping families to have a baby.  We are the global leader in the field of fertility drugs and committed to supporting the success and improvement in ART by going beyond drugs with innovative technologies,  explained Meeta Gulyani, Head of Global Strategy and Franchises at the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.  By forging the Global Fertility Alliance with partners like Illumina and Genea, we aim to support the development of needed global standards in ART labs. This will ensure a consistently high level of performance between different centers and countries.  With the establishment of the alliance, Illumina, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Genea emphasize their desire to help improve fertility outcomes by contributing to the standardization of technologies and protocols in ART labs. Currently, variation in practices and techniques can lead to inconsistent results and outcomes. Recognizing the importance of innovation in ART technologies, the alliance aims to enhance progress and innovation in three ways. Firstly, the founding members aim to foster integration of multiple, leading fertility technologies. Secondly, building on this, the alliance will aim to collaborate with leading health care professionals and medical societies to develop global standards. And finally, as technologies in the fertility space are rapidly advancing, the alliance will also develop educational resources for health care professionals worldwide. These efforts will include training curricula and workshops, as well as access to model labs, symposia and events at medical meetings.  Illumina has a strong commitment to improving in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes through the use of industry-leading genomics, but appreciates that there are many factors that impact ART outcomes,  said Tristan Orpin, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Reproductive and Genetic Health for Illumina.  Founding the Global Fertility Alliance together with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Genea represents an exciting opportunity for us to share our knowledge and experience with the wider community and to help bring alignment and higher consistency to ART practices worldwide. Having already partnered with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in other treatment areas, we are confident this collaboration of innovators in the fertility field will deliver a significant positive impact for health care professionals, fertility labs, and most importantly their patients.   Increasing success rates for patients worldwide and advancing the science of fertility treatment is an integral part of our mission,  said Tomas Stojanov, CEO of Genea.  The new Global Fertility Alliance for excellence in ART will drive automation and standardization in the field and support health care professionals in providing their patients with the best possible outcomes.  In order to rapidly progress the initiative, Illumina, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Genea will actively contribute to the alliance and establish a board of representatives, which will meet regularly. At the same time, the companies invite new members, who demonstrate a consistent commitment to driving technology innovation and improving ART results, to join the alliance.","Published: June 9, 2015"

The trial seeks to determine whether targeted therapies for people whose tumors have specific gene mutations will be effective regardless of their cancer type. NCI-MATCH will incorporate more than 20 different study drugs or drug combinations, each targeting a specific gene mutation, in order to match each patient in the trial with a therapy that targets a molecular abnormality in their tumor. The study was co-developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, part of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). It is being led by ECOG-ACRIN. NCI-MATCH is a phase II trial with numerous small substudies (arms) for each treatment being investigated. It will open with approximately 10 substudies, moving to 20 or more within months. The study parameters for the first 10 arms are being sent to 2,400 participating sites in the NCTN for review in preparation for patient enrollment beginning in July. The exact date for the opening of patient enrollment will be decided shortly after the ASCO meeting. Additional substudies are in development and will be added over time as the trial progresses. The NCI-MATCH trial has two enrollment steps. Each patient will initially enroll for screening in which samples of their tumor will be removed (biopsied). The samples will undergo DNA sequencing to detect genetic abnormalities that may be driving tumor growth and might be targeted by one of a wide range of drugs being studied. If a molecular abnormality is detected for which there is a specific substudy available, to be accepted in NCI-MATCH patients will be further evaluated to determine if they meet the specific eligibility requirements within that arm. Once enrolled, patients will be treated with the targeted drug regimen for as long as their tumor shrinks or remains stable. Overall, trial investigators plan to screen about 3,000 patients during the full course of the NCI-MATCH trial to enroll about 1,000 patients in the various treatment arms. Adults 18 years of age and older with solid tumors or lymphomas that have advanced following at least one line of standard systemic therapy, or with tumors for which there is no standard treatment, will be eligible. Each arm of the trial will enroll up to 35 patients. The trial s design calls for at least a quarter of the 1,000-patients enrolled to involve people with rare types of cancer.  NCI-MATCH is a unique, ground-breaking trial,  said Doug Lowy, M.D., NCI acting director. ""It is the first study in oncology that incorporates all of the tenets of precision medicine. There are no other cancer clinical trials of this size and scope that truly bring the promise of targeted treatment to patients whose cancers have specific genetic abnormalities. It holds the potential to transform cancer care.  Since many gene mutations in tumors are infrequent or unique, screening for individual mutations is not cost-effective or efficient in clinical trials. Instead, NCI-MATCH will use advanced gene sequencing techniques to screen for many molecular abnormalities at once. Large numbers of patient tumors will need to be screened because most gene mutations occur in 10 percent or less of cancer patients. Most patients are expected to have one, or at most two, treatable mutations in their tumors. By having multiple treatments available for these genetic abnormalities in a single clinical trial, several different study drugs or drug combinations can be evaluated simultaneously.  In addition to exploring very fundamental aspects of cancer biology and therapy, this trial will bring cutting-edge molecular analysis and a large portfolio of targeted therapy treatment regimens to patients being treated at oncology practices large and small,  said ECOG-ACRIN study chair, Keith T. Flaherty, M.D., a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor, Harvard Medical School, both in Boston. NCI-MATCH will use a single DNA sequencing test to identify gene mutations in patients  tumors. The NCI Molecular Characterization Laboratory at the NCI Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research in Frederick, Maryland, has developed the test which looks for 143 genes associated with cancer that can be targeted by drugs in the trial. To ensure quality control, biopsy specimens from all 3,000 screened patients will be sent to a single location for processing: the ECOG-ACRIN Central Biorepository and Pathology Facility at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The DNA sequencing analysis will be done at one of four facilities using a standardized process. ""The use of a unique kit for specimen collection, shipment, and centralized tissue processing, assures high-quality analysis,  said ECOG-ACRIN laboratory lead, Stanley R. Hamilton, M.D., head of pathology and laboratory medicine at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.  The network of four molecular diagnostics labs provides capacity for large numbers of patients to be screened in the trial. Pilot testing of specimens across the four locations showed remarkable reproducibility of the molecular results another important aspect of quality assurance in trials of this scope and scale."" The cancer treatment drugs being used in NCI-MATCH include both U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs as well as investigational agents that are being contributed by a number of pharmaceutical companies. Most of the arms in the trial will incorporate single-agent drugs that are either commercially available or are still being tested in clinical trials. However, a few arms will contain combinations of drugs for which there are enough safety data and evidence that they might be active against a particular genetic abnormality. Since NCI-MATCH is designed to explore whether drugs are effective against specific molecular abnormalities, patients who have tumors that can be treated with a drug already approved by the FDA for their molecular abnormality will not be eligible to use the same drug in NCI-MATCH. They could be considered for other drugs within NCI-MATCH if they have already received an approved therapy and have a different genetic abnormality that could be targeted with a new drug. There are two main clinical endpoints in the NCI-MATCH trial. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate, which is the proportion of patients in the trial whose tumors shrink by a predefined amount over a specific time period. The secondary endpoint is 6-month progression-free survival, which is a measure of whether a patient s disease remains stable.  For our purposes, a response rate of 5 percent or less in a molecularly-defined population will not be considered promising, whereas a response rate of 16 percent to 25 percent will be encouraging,  said NCI study co-chair Barbara A. Conley, M.D., associate director of the NCI s Cancer Diagnosis Program.  After starting treatment in NCI-MATCH, a 6-month progression-free survival of 15 percent will not be considered promising, whereas a progression-free survival at six months of 35 percent will indicate that we would want to develop that treatment further.  Enrollment in NCI-MATCH will be available across the country through NCTN sites. In addition, the trial will be available through sites nationwide that participate in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. All of the approximately 2,400 sites that participate in the trial will use the NCI Central Institutional Review Board as the institutional review board of record. Sites will access the trial under the protocol identification EAY131 via the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit. The principal investigators who will lead the substudies are situated throughout the NCTN and its participating network groups: ECOG-ACRIN, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, NRG Oncology and SWOG. All of these investigators have expertise in molecular studies, and many are junior researchers involved with, and being mentored by, experienced senior investigators. Patient advocates were engaged in the development of the trial and will help oversee the protocol and other aspects of the study.","Published: June 9, 2015"

The study findings were reported in the June 3, 2015, issue of Science Translational Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Key collaborators in the study, which was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, included Yong Zhang, PhD (LIMR), Iossif Strehin, PhD (Allergan), and Phillip Messersmith, PhD (University of California, Berkeley).  We discovered that the HIF-1 pathway-an oxygen regulatory pathway predominantly used early in evolution but still used during embryonic development-can act to trigger healthy regrowth of lost or damaged tissue in mice, opening up new possibilities for mammalian tissue regeneration,  says Heber-Katz, a professor at LIMR who heads the Laboratory of Regenerative Medicine. The discovery is the latest development in a long investigation sparked by a chance observation in an unusual mouse strain. Almost 20 years ago, Heber-Katz noticed that the MRL mouse can spontaneously regenerate cartilage and other tissues after injury, making it a rare exception among mammals. Years of subsequent research involving the MRL mouse led Heber-Katz and colleagues to theorize that the HIF-1 pathway, which helps cells respond to low oxygen conditions, may also hold the key to the unique regenerative capability of MRL mice. In the current study, the scientific team focused on the HIF-1a protein, the expression of which is markedly increased before and after injury in the MRL mouse. Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF-1a is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Stabilization of HIF-1a levels can be accomplished through inhibition of PHDs. To test their theory, the researchers first experimentally down-regulated HIF-1a in MRL mice, which they found led to a loss of regenerative capability in the mice. Next, they selected a non-regenerating strain of mice to see what would happen when they experimentally up-regulated (stabilized) HIF-1a levels after an ear hole punch injury. The mice received three injections of a PHD inhibitor in a slow-release formulation at 5-day intervals. After 30 days, the researchers observed ear hole healing with closure and regrowth of cartilage and new hair follicles. In addition, the drug-treated mice showed a pattern of molecular changes indistinguishable from that observed in MRL mice during regeneration in response to injury, confirming HIF-1a as a central driver of healthy regeneration of lost or damaged tissue in mice. Heber-Katz notes that unlike other approaches to tissue regeneration, their group found that it was possible to achieve healthy tissue regrowth in a mouse model in situ, without the use of stem cells.  Our experiment shows the possibility of taking mature cells and, with addition of HIF-1a, causing dedifferentiation to a highly immature state where the cells can proliferate, followed by redifferentiation upon withdrawal of HIF-1a,  says Heber-Katz.  Many researchers in the field see tissue regeneration as a very complex set of events, but some of us look at it more as a process that needs to be turned on and allowed to go to completion. This is what is so exciting about what we saw with drug-induced stabilization of HIF-1a.  Heber-Katz and her collaborators plan to move ahead to modify the drug delivery system to achieve an ideal formulation, which they will use to investigate regrowth potential in many types of tissues.  This remarkable work has vast importance in medicine and surgery and spotlights the diverse and important scientific investigations underway at LIMR,  says George Prendergast, PhD, President and CEO of LIMR.  We are committed to the quest to discover therapies that make healthy tissue regeneration a possibility in humans. ","Published: June 9, 2015"

The results, which are published in the scientific journal Scientific Reports, show that human stem cells that are transplanted to the injured spinal cord contribute to restoration of some sensory functions. Traffic accidents and severe falls can cause ruptures of nerve fibers that enter/exit the spinal cord. Most commonly, these avulsion injuries affect the innervation of the arm and hand, and lead to paralysis, loss of sensation and cause chronic pain. Surgical interventions can help the patient regain some muscle function, but there is currently no treatment able to restore sensory functions. The reason for this is the emergence of a  barrier  at the junction between the ruptured nerve fibers and the spinal cord which prevents them from growing into the spinal cord and restore lost nerve connections. In a new study the PhD students Jan Hoeber, Niclas K nig and Carl Trolle, working in Dr.Elena Kozlova s research group transplanted human stem cells to an avulsion injury in mice with the aim to restore a functional route for sensory information from peripheral tissues into the spinal cord. The results show that the transplanted stem cells act as a  bridge  which allows injured sensory nerve fibers to grow into the spinal cord, rebuild functional nerve connections, and thereby achieve long term restoration of major parts of the lost sensory functions. The transplanted stem cells differentiated to different types of cells with variable level of maturation, specific for the nervous system. No signs of tumor development or any functional abnormalities from the transplants were observed in the study, outcomes which are important in view of potential risks with transplantation of embryonic stem cells. The results encourage further research on the use of stem cells for treatment of injury and disease in the spinal cord, and may contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies in these disorders.

Part of what makes them so successful is their ability to invade our bodies, overcoming our natural defences. Understanding how they do this could lead to new ways of preventing their invasion.Image: Institute of Food Research  Most Salmonella infections result in gastroenteritis, when the bacteria invade the epithelial cells lining our gut. However, under certain conditions, Salmonella can subsequently cause a potentially lethal systemic typhoidal infection when they invade the underlying immune cells. The invasion of epithelial cells and immune cells are controlled by two separate gene clusters called Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands 1 and 2 (SPI1, SPI2) respectively. Now Dr Arthur Thompson and colleagues from the Institute of Food Research have shown how certain factors within Salmonella help to coordinate the deployment of SPI1 and SPI2. The control system involves two proteins (RpoS and DksA) and ppGpp, an alarmone. Alarmones are molecules that bacteria produce in response to extreme environments, such as in the harsh environment of the gut. In conjunction with each other, these components help to coordinate when and where SPI1 and SPI1 genes are expressed, in phases that match the steps in Salmonella s infection strategy.  We ve shown how RpoS, DskA and ppGpp modulate the distribution and activity of RNA polymerase to allow the phased expression of SPI1 and SPI2  said Dr Thompson of the IFR, which is strategically funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

The breakthrough will make a big splash in the field of drug discovery and development, where precise protein structure blueprints can help researchers understand how individual proteins work. Critically, these blueprints can show weaknesses that allow drug developers to draw up specific battle plans in the fight against diseases and infections. Professor of Membrane Structural and Functional Biology at Trinity, Martin Caffrey, is the senior author of the research.. He said:  This is a truly exciting development. We have demonstrated the method on a variety of cell membrane proteins, some of which act as transporters. It will work with existing equipment at a host of facilities worldwide, and it is very simple to implement.  Over 50% of drugs on the market target cell membrane proteins, which are vital for the everyday functioning of complex cellular processes. They act as transporters to ensure that specific molecules enter and leave our cells, as signal interpreters important in decoding messages and initiating responses, and as agents that speed up appropriate responses. The major challenge facing researchers is the production of large membrane protein crystals, which are used to determine the precise 3-D structural blueprints. That challenge has now been lessened thanks to the Trinity biochemists  advent - the in meso in situ serial crystallography (IMISX) method. Beforehand, researchers needed to harvest protein crystals and cool them at inhospitable temperatures in a complex set of events that was damaging, inefficient and prone to error. The IMISX method allows researchers to determine structural blueprints as and where the crystals grow. Professor Caffrey added:  The best part of this is that these proteins are as close to being  live  and yet packaged in the crystals we need to determine their structure as they could ever be. As a result, this breakthrough is likely to supplant existing protocols and will make the early stages of drug development considerably more efficient.  ","Published: June 8, 2015"

The alliance aims to improve the consistency in ART worldwide and addresses the need for more standardization of fertility processes within the ART laboratory. The three companies will launch their initiative at the 31st Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Lisbon, Portugal, on 13 June 2015. This is another important step for Illumina towards establishing global standards in the growing market of fertility technologies and the ultimate goal of helping families to have a baby.  ""We are the global leader in the field of fertility drugs and committed to supporting the success and improvement in ART by going beyond drugs with innovative technologies,"" explained Meeta Gulyani, Head of Global Strategy and Franchises at the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. ""By forging the Global Fertility Alliance with partners like Illumina and Genea, we aim to support the development of needed global standards in ART labs. This will ensure a consistently high level of performance between different centers and countries.""  With the establishment of the alliance, Illumina, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Genea emphasize their desire to help improve fertility outcomes by contributing to the standardization of technologies and protocols in ART labs. Currently, variation in practices and techniques can lead to inconsistent results and outcomes. Recognizing the importance of innovation in ART technologies, the alliance aims to enhance progress and innovation in three ways. Firstly, the founding members aim to foster integration of multiple, leading fertility technologies. Secondly, building on this, the alliance will aim to collaborate with leading health care professionals and medical societies to develop global standards. And finally, as technologies in the fertility space are rapidly advancing, the alliance will also develop educational resources for health care professionals worldwide. These efforts will include training curricula and workshops, as well as access to model labs, symposia and events at medical meetings.  ""Illumina has a strong commitment to improving in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes through the use of industry-leading genomics, but appreciates that there are many factors that impact ART outcomes,"" said Tristan Orpin, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Reproductive and Genetic Health for Illumina.

In a study posted online on June 5, 2015, and to be published in the July 2015 issue of Genome Research, the researchers reported that the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas9 is six times more effective than other techniques at homing in on target genes and inserting or deleting specific sequences. The study also demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 method can be used in a  multiplexed  fashion   that is, targeting and mutating multiple genes at the same time to determine their functions.  It was shown about a year ago that CRISPR can knock out a gene quickly,  said Shawn Burgess, Ph.D., a senior investigator with NHGRI s Translational and Functional Genomics Branch and head of the Developmental Genomics Section.  What we have done is to establish an entire pipeline for knocking out many genes and testing their function quickly in a vertebrate model.  Researchers often try to determine the role of a gene by knocking it out   turning it off or removing it   and watching the potential effects on an organism lacking it.NHGRI scientists are homing in on specific genes in zebrafish to help them better understand the function of genes in people [Image taken from NIH.gov]. Such larger scale   termed high-throughput   gene targeting in an animal model could be particularly useful for human genomic research. Only 10 to 20 percent of recognized human genes have been subjected to such rigorous testing, Dr. Burgess said. The functions of many other genes have been inferred based on analyzing proteins or have been identified as possible disease genes, but the functions of those genes have not been confirmed by knocking them out in animal models and seeing what happens.  This is a way to do that on a more cost-efficient and large scale,  Dr. Burgess said.  The study of zebrafish has already led to advances in our understanding of cancer and other human diseases,  said NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D.  We anticipate that the techniques developed by NHGRI researchers will accelerate understanding the biological function of specific genes and the role they play in human genetic diseases.  The CRISPR/Cas9 method of gene editing is one of the two essential components in the NHGRI team s high-throughput method. Modeled on a defense mechanism evolved by bacteria against viruses, CRISPR/Cas9 activity was first described in 2012. Since then, its use has spread quickly in genomic research labs in the United States and abroad. The acronym CRISPR stands for  clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat,  referring to a pattern of DNA sequences that appears frequently in bacterial DNA. Scientists believe the CRISPR sequences reflect evolutionary responses to past viral attacks. The Cas9 protein is a nuclease, an enzyme that snips a stretch of DNA in two places, in effect cutting out a piece. Bound together, CRISPR/Cas9 becomes a powerful research tool that permits researchers to target and delete a particular sequence or to insert a new sequence into the DNA of animal-model embryos. The other essential component of the NHGRI team s method is the zebrafish. The zebrafish and the mouse are the most commonly studied vertebrate laboratory animals whose genomes have been completely sequenced. The zebrafish is better suited to larger scale gene editing because about 70 percent of zebrafish genes appear to have human counterparts and the fish are far less costly to maintain than are mice. They multiply astonishingly quickly; a female may produce as many as 200 eggs at one time. And the embryos are fertilized externally and are transparent, making them readily accessible to researchers. To demonstrate the feasibility of high throughput editing, the researchers targeted 162 locations in 83 zebrafish genes   about 50 of which are similar to human genes involved in deafness. (Hearing is one of the other interests of Dr. Burgess s lab.) This produced mutations in 82 of the 83 genes. In screening embryos by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput DNA sequencing, the researchers determined that overall, mutations were passed on to the next generation in 28 percent of cases. The transmission rate was higher for some genes than for others, but in most cases, screening offspring from parent fish should be enough to spot most mutations, the researchers reported. The results demonstrated that using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique in zebrafish will make it possible to both generate mutants for all genes in the zebrafish genome and carry out large-scale phenotyping, they noted in the Genome Researchpaper. The CRISPR/Cas9 methodology works in mice, too, but it is more costly and takes far longer. Although mice actually reach sexual maturity earlier than zebrafish, they produce far fewer offspring. Ultimately, Dr. Burgess hopes that his lab will use the new method to knock out about 10 percent of the zebrafish s roughly 25,000 genes, and he would like to see an even broader effort.  We ve shown that with relatively moderate resources, you can analyze hundreds of genes,  Dr. Burgess said.  On the scale of big science, you could target every gene in the genome with what would be a relatively modest scientific investment in the low tens of millions of dollars.

The study appears in the journal Pediatric Critical Care Medicine. TBI patients at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital from 2000 to 2008 were divided into two groups: those who received autologous bone marrow stem cells as part of a pilot study and those who did not. Researchers used the Pediatric Intensity Level of Therapy score to determine the degree of therapeutic intensity that was done to reduce the cranial pressure below the danger zone. For those who received the stem cells, researchers noted a significant reduction in the score beginning at 24 hours post-treatment through the first week. Patients who did not receive the stem cells spent nearly twice as much time in neurointensive care -- 15.6 days compared to 8.2.

Cox, Jr., M.D., principal investigator, professor and the George and Cynthia Mitchell Distinguished Chair in Neurosciences at UTHealth and co-director of the Texas Trauma Institute at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center.

In both black and white patients, having had a stroke meant that their score on a 27-item test of memory and thinking speed had dropped as much as it would have if they had aged 7.9 years overnight. For the study, data from more than 4,900 black and white seniors over the age of 65 was analyzed by a team from the University of Michigan U-M Medical School and School of Public Health and the VA Center for Clinical Management Research. The results will be published in the July issue of Stroke and are available online. Researchers married two sources of information for their analysis: detailed surveys and tests of memory and thinking speed over multiple years from participants in a large, national study of older Americans, and Medicare data from the same individuals. They zeroed in on the 7.5 percent of black study participants, and the 6.7 percent of white participants, who had no recent history of stroke, dementia or other cognitive issues, but who suffered a documented stroke within 12 years of their first survey and cognitive test in 1998. By measuring participants  changes in cognitive test scores over time from 1998 to 2012, the researchers could see that both blacks and whites did significantly worse on the test after their stroke than they had before. Although the size of the effect was the same among blacks and whites, past research has shown that the rates of cognitive problems in older blacks are generally twice that of non-Hispanic whites. So the new results mean that stroke doesn t account for the mysterious differences in memory and cognition that grow along racial lines as people age.  The researchers say the findings underscore the importance of stroke prevention.  As we search for the key drivers of the known disparities in cognitive decline between blacks and whites, we focus here on the role of  health shocks  such as stroke,  says lead author and U-M Medical School assistant professor Deborah Levine, M.D., MPH.  Although we found that stroke does not explain the difference, these results show the amount of cognitive aging that stroke brings on, and therefore the importance of stroke prevention to reduce the risk of cognitive decline.  Other research on disparities in cognitive decline has focused on racial differences in socioeconomic status, education, and vascular risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and smoking that can all contribute to stroke risk. These factors may explain some but not all of the racial differences in cognitive decline. Levine and her colleagues note that certain factors   such as how many years a person has vascular risk factors, and the quality of his or her education, as well as genetic and biological factors   might play a role in racial differences in long-term cognitive performance. But one thing is clear: strokes have serious consequences for brain function. On average, they rob the brain of eight years of cognitive health. Therefore, people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds can benefit from taking steps to reduce their risk of a stroke. That includes controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, stopping or avoiding smoking, controlling blood sugar in diabetes, and being active even in older age.

Examining specific characteristics of each patient s tumor has also given researchers clearer understanding of which patients should receive the combination. These initial findings from the phase III clinical trial confirm the results of the phase II trial, presented just weeks ago at the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting in Philadelphia and published by MSK researchers online in NEJM. Jedd Wolchok, Chief of MSK s Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, designed and led the phase III randomized, double-blind trial, in which 945 patients with untreated advanced melanoma were randomized to receive ipilimumab alone, nivolumab alone, or a combination of the two. While this study was not designed for a formal statistical comparison between the nivolumab group and the combination group, exploratory analyses revealed more frequent responses and longer PFS in the combination group when compared with nivolumab alone. Patients receiving the combination experienced a median PFS of 11.5 months, while median PFS for patients receiving nivolumab alone was 6.9 months and ipilimumab alone was 2.9 months. Of the 314 patients receiving the combination, 57.6 percent had an objective response, measured as a significant reduction in tumor size, versus 43.7 percent of the 316 receiving nivolumab alone and 19 percent of the 315 receiving ipilimumab alone.  All the early preclinical and clinical work supported the idea that combining these two immunotherapy drugs could result in better outcomes for patients,  said Dr. Wolchok.  We re encouraged by the progression-free survival data we re currently reporting. It is a testament to how drastically immunotherapy has altered the prognostic landscape for some advanced melanoma patients. Just five years ago, many of these patients would have been expected to live for only seven months following diagnosis - but it s important to remember that overall survival data for this group is not yet available.  Adverse side effects such as diarrhea and increased lipase occurred in 55 percent of patients receiving the combination - leading about one-third of these patients to stop the regimen. About 16 percent of patients receiving nivolumab alone and 27 percent of patients receiving ipilimumab alone experienced side effects, with nearly 8 percent and 15 percent of patients discontinuing, respectively. Ipilimumab and nivolumab are part of a class of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, which unleash patients  immune system to attack their cancer. The immune system has several checkpoints in place to avoid an overreaction. Ipilimumab works by blocking the CTLA-4 checkpoint, a molecular brake that stops T cells from becoming fully and persistently activated. Similarly, nivolumab prevents the molecule PD-L1, expressed by tumors, from binding to T cells and deactivating them. Notably in this trial, patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 experienced a median PFS of 14 months regardless of whether they received the combination or nivolumab alone, but for patients whose tumors did not express PD-L1, the median PFS was longer on the combination (11.2 months) than on nivolumab alone (5.3 months).  One of the biggest questions in the field of immunotherapy has been how to determine which patients will respond to immune-modulating drugs. Now we have another piece of data,  said Dr. Wolchok.  A pathology test can identify patients whose tumors express PD-L1, and this information will help the patient and physician decide whether to use the combination or nivolumab alone, knowing the toxicity risks and the difference in PFS. However, if a patient s tumor does not express PD-L1, the data suggests it makes more sense to offer the combination. This understanding gets us closer to  precision immunotherapy.  Dr. Wolchok, who is also the Associate Director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy at MSK, designed this clinical trial on a napkin at the 2012 ASCO annual meeting  before the data from the phase I trial were even presented.  Even then, we knew the potential that immunotherapy could have for the lives of patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma and other cancers,  he said.  As we present this exciting and hopeful data to the international oncology community, we pause and thank the patients who enrolled in this - and all - clinical trials. These individuals are blazing the trails of cancer research, and we are indebted to them for helping to better the care of patients for generations to come. ","Published: June 6, 2015"

Their findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. This study provides the first evidence in primates, including humans, of an association between delay of gratification performance and white matter connectivity between the caudate and the dorsal prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, said Dr. Robert Latzman, assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Georgia State, who led the study with Dr. William Hopkins, professor of neuroscience at Georgia State. The researchers found higher white matter connectivity between the caudate and dorsal prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere of the brain was associated with the learning of delay of gratification. Delay of gratification, the need to control emotional and behavioral impulses, is one of the earliest demands placed on individuals and is of critical importance, Latzman said. ""Delay of gratification or self-control is core to a number of different types of mental illnesses, most notably ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder),"" said Latzman. ""This ability and the developmental process that occurs when children learn to delay gratification and inhibit an immediate want for a longer-term goal is a hugely important developmental milestone."" There is a considerable need for understanding connections among brain regions associated with delay of gratification abilities, such as the two regions that showed significant results in this study, Latzman said. The task used to measure delay of gratification in chimpanzees in this study is a parallel task to that used in a series of famous experiments conducted by psychologist Walter Mischel at Stanford University in the 1960s and 1970s. Preschoolers were placed alone in a room furnished with a small desk and on the desk were two marshmallows and a bell. The researcher told the child he had to leave the room, but when he returned, the child could eat both marshmallows. If the child wanted to eat one marshmallow before the researcher returned, the child could ring the bell and eat one, but not both. When the researcher shut the door, some children ate the marshmallow right away and others tried to distract themselves, according to The New York Times. In follow-up studies, Mischel found that delay of gratification abilities at age 4 can predict a number of behaviors into adolescence and adulthood, including planning and reasoning abilities, control of negative emotions, standardized test scores, higher educational attainment, better coping abilities, fewer interpersonal difficulties, less substance use and higher self-esteem and self-worth more than 20 years later, according to Latzman. The current study involved 49 chimpanzees that were trained to perform a delay of gratification task. Researchers placed grapes in a transparent PVC pipe with a closed bottom and trained the chimpanzees to delay gratification in receiving the grapes. The study used chimpanzees because their self-control abilities, as compared to other model species such as monkeys, closely resemble those of human children and both their neuroanatomy and neural development are quite similar to humans. They also share a very high degree of genetic overlap, Latzman said. ""We trained them to learn that if they waited, the one grape becomes two grapes and two grapes become three grapes and three grapes become four grapes and so on. There's variability in how well they do and it was this variability that we were interested in,"" Latzman said. All chimpanzees received DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) brain scans during their annual physical examination. Data were acquired that allowed the researchers to examine white matter tracts, or bundles of neurons that connect one part of the nervous system with another, between the caudate and prefrontal cortex.

The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting a link between cancer and disruption of circadian rhythms, while offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the biological clock. The ticking of the biological clock drives fluctuations in gene activity and protein levels that give rise to daily cycles in virtually every aspect of physiology in humans and other animals. A master clock in the brain, tuned to the daily cycle of light and dark, sends out signals that synchronize the molecular clocks ticking away in almost every cell and tissue of the body. Disruption of the clock has been associated with a variety of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. According to Carrie Partch, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper, the connection between clock disruption and cancer is still unclear. ""The clock is not always disrupted in cancer cells, but studies have shown that disrupting circadian rhythms in mice causes tumors to grow faster, and one of the things the clock does is set restrictions on when cells can divide,"" she said.Carrie Patch, courtesy of University of California Santa Cruz The new study focused on a protein called PASD1 that Partch's collaborators at the University of Oxford had found was expressed in a broad range of cancer cells, including melanoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. It belongs to a group of proteins known as ""cancer/testis antigens,"" which are normally expressed in the germ line cells that give rise to sperm and eggs, but are also found in some cancer cells. Cancer researchers have been interested in these proteins as markers for cancer and as potential targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. ""For very few of these do we understand the roles they might play in driving cancer,"" Partch said. ""Understanding how PASD1 is regulating the circadian clock could open the door to developing new therapies. We could potentially find ways to disrupt it in those cancers in which it is expressed."" Beyond its role in cancer, Partch is also interested in understanding the normal role of PASD1 and why it is silencing the clock in the human germ line. The germ line is the only tissue in the body that researchers have found does not have circadian cycles. A series of experiments in Partch's lab revealed how the protein interacts with the molecular machinery of the biological clock. There are four main clock genes, and the interactions of these genes and the proteins they encode create a feedback loop that drives molecular oscillations on a 24-hour cycle. Two proteins, CLOCK and BMAL1, form a complex that turns on the Period and Cryptochrome genes. The Period and Cryptochrome proteins then combine to turn off the genes for CLOCK and BMAL1. Partch and her colleagues found that PASD1 is structurally related to CLOCK and interferes with the function of the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex. ""It shuts the clock off very efficiently,"" Partch said. The researchers also studied cancer cell lines that express PASD1 and showed that blocking the protein (using RNA interference techniques) turned the clock cycle back on in those cells. Partch's lab is continuing to investigate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the protein's interactions with the molecular clock. ""By understanding what makes the clock tick and how it is regulated, we may be able to identify points where we can intervene pharmacologically to treat disorders in which the clock is disrupted,"" she said. In another recent paper from Partch's lab, researchers at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Memphis worked out important details of the interactions between two of the main clock proteins. They found that Cryptochrome interacts with a particular section of BMAL1, and that mutations causing structural changes in that section can alter the timing of the clock, resulting in cycles as short as 19 hours or as long as 26 hours. ""This study answers the longstanding question of how Cryptochrome works, and it's something we think we can drug. If we can control this process with small molecules, we can affect the timing of the clock,"" Partch said. Several clock gene mutations have been identified in people with disorders that involve the timing of the biological clock, causing either advanced sleep syndrome or delayed sleep syndrome. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that environmental changes affecting circadian rhythms, including shift work and jet lag, can have profound effects on human physiology and health. ""There are vast consequences to trying to live outside the natural daily cycle,"" Partch said. ""We know that clock disruption in general is not a good thing, and we have ongoing studies to explore its role in cancer and other human health problems.""","Published: June 5, 2015"

Instead of trying to find a mutation in the genomic sequence of a person with a genetic disease, they sequenced the genomes of healthy participants, then analyzed the data to find  putative,  or presumed, mutations that would almost certainly lead to a genetic condition. Out of almost 1,000 volunteers whose genomes were examined, about 100 had genomic variants predicting that they would have a rare disease. Almost half of them indeed had the disease when researchers went back and carefully evaluated them, said Leslie G. Biesecker, M.D., chief of the Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch (MGMGB) at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and corresponding author of the study published June 4, 2015, in the American Journal of Human Genetics.  We were surprised that this many individuals had positive findings in a group of individuals that is basically healthy,  said Jennifer Johnston, Ph.D., lead author and staff scientist with the Clinical Genetics Section of the MGMGB. The research is part of ClinSeq, a large-scale, NIH research study that explores the fundamental medical, molecular and bioinformatic challenges facing individualized genome sequencing in a clinical research setting. Once they identified participants with genomic mutations, researchers called them back to the clinic to give them a customized work-up. They called this method of looking at the person after looking at the genomic data  iterative phenotyping.  Researchers sifted through more than 100,000 variants per participant   nearly all harmless   and studied only potentially harmful mutations that were found in about 100 of the 951 participants. Of those hundred or so patients, 79 were followed up, and they confirmed that 34 had the specific condition linked to their genetic mutation. These findings indicate that 3 percent or more of the U.S. population may have a genetic condition compared to previous estimates of less than 0.02 percent.  We achieved about a 50 percent accuracy of predicting disease in people not knowing anything about their health status beforehand,  Dr. Biesecker said. In other words, the researchers changed the odds of these patients having one of these diseases from something like 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 2. Given this accuracy, Dr. Biesecker is upbeat about the future of genomic medicine.  These results show that you can dramatically improve your predictions based on genome sequence information.  NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D, agreed, adding:  Today, we tend to deliver medical care based on the expected response of the average patient, and yet we know that this is far from perfect. Eventually, we want to deliver medical care based on individual genomic differences that enable more precise ways to prevent and treat disease. These findings move us closer to that reality.  The team also found that having a mutation did not always lead to a condition that looked like a textbook case. Indeed, 20 of 79 of the participants with harmful mutations and an associated physical change didn t know they might have a genetic condition. Sometimes these physical changes were so mild that the participant had neither sought a diagnosis nor reported them to the research team during enrollment in the study. While it may seem unnecessary to find these mild cases, one key aspect of genomics is that the same mutation can affect family members with different levels of severity.  A couple of the participants with LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) mutations thought they just had garden variety high cholesterol, when in fact they had familial hypercholesterolemia,  said Dr. Biesecker. This led to more aggressive cholesterol screening in other family members, including children as young as eight, because early treatment can delay heart attacks and prolong life. Researchers found other evidence that genetic conditions are underestimated. That is because, until now, knowledge about genetic conditions has mostly been based on family health history or ill people who walk into a clinic. This has led researchers to study only those who are more severely affected and not those who are mildly affected or not affected at all, which eventually leads to an overestimation of the condition s severity and an underestimation of its prevalence. The problem (ascertainment bias) has long been known and acknowledged by genetics researchers. They have only recently been able to address it as DNA sequencing costs have plummeted. At this rate, just above 9 million people, about the population of New Jersey, may be living with some sort of genetic condition. The authors caution that not all healthy people need to have their genomes sequenced, emphasizing that this is a proof-of-concept study that may lead to a better understanding of how these mutations affect health.  We want to add DNA sequencing to the physician s toolbox,  Dr. Biesecker said.  It is fine to take care of patients once they are sick and that s appropriate, but wouldn t it be better to find some patients before they are sick and take care of them? ","Published: June 5, 2015"

This is the conclusion made by the joint group of Russian and German scientists lead by Olga Vinogradova, who is a professor at the M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University and also a head of laboratory at the A.N. Frumkin Institute of Physical chemistry and Electrochemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This work is related to the field of microfluidics, which is promising and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field of research, studying the fluid flow in the microchannels. Microfluidics is especially demanded in chemistry and biomedical research, where there is a necessity to carry out chemical synthesis of small doses of substance or to perform separation of particles of the biomaterial.' Microfluidics forms the basis of so-called Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) devices, which are miniature devices allowing to perform multistage chemical processes, including chemical reactions, mixing, concentration and separation, on a chip the size of a small coin,' Olga Vinogradova says. According to Vinogradova, such systems are promising not only as microreactors in synthetic chemistry, but also as portable analytical devices, e.g., for the diagnosis of cancer and infectious diseases. Difficulties with mixing of liquids are one of the biggest problems the researchers working with the microchannels face. The point is that the flow in such channels is laminar (i.e. layered). There is no convection on laminar flow, that is why the liquids mix very slowly, only by diffusion. Physicists managed to find a sophisticated solution to the problem based on the use of superhydrophobic surfaces. Such surfaces are made from water repellent material. Moreover, they are microrough. As a result, air microbubbles are retained in the recesses of a superhydrophobic surface texture. Such an 'air cushion' makes superhydrophobic surface very slippery. In this paper, researchers have suggested to use superhydrophobic texture in the form of parallel grooves, inclined at a certain angle to the axis of the channel, wherein the upper wall the grooves are turned to the right and at the bottom they are turned to the left. Such grooves impart the walls of the channel with anisotropic characteristics as the liquid flows along them faster than transversely. Moreover, it turned out that apart from the main channel flow there is a secondary shear fluid flow in the transverse direction to the axis of the channel. As a result, the fluid begins to roll slightly near the walls in the same way a bullet rotates moving along a rifled barrel of a rifle. 'If the fluid moves very slowly, then a very elongated transverse vortex forms in the channels,' says Tatiana Nizkaya, who is a co-author of the paper, working at the A.N. Frumkin Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. 'However, with an increase in liquid flow speed the liquid begins to 'sideslip' on turns.' According to Evgeny Asmolov, who is a co-author of the paper, working at the A.N. Frumkin Institute of Physical chemistry and Electrochemistry and the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, this vortex is superimposed by the smaller ones, which are limited by the neighbouring grooves. It means that the artificial turbulence is being formed in the flow. 'Such flows may be useful for mixing liquids or for the separation of particles of different sizes,' Evgeny Asmolov adds. Russian scientists with their colleagues from the University of Mainz (Germany) carried out computer simulations of the predicted effect by the method of dissipative particle dynamics. They analyzed the trajectory of the model of fluid particles in a microchannel and studied the dependence of the shape and the number of vortices on the flow rate. According to the simulation results, the authors concluded that there is critical speed at which the single large vortex is broken up into many small ones, what eventually leads to a new efficient mechanism of mixing liquids. 'Systems for efficient mixing in microchannels, based on the use of a special 'pattern' of the surface of the channel, already exist. For example, to spin liquid, specific obstacles at the bottom of the channel have a herringbone pattern. This time the vortex occurs due to the side walls,' says Tatiana Nizkaya. 'Our method is much easier as you simply take two superhydrophobic planes with stripes of gas and rotate them at an angle to each other. Furthermore, the partition of the vortex into many smaller ones allows simultaneously mixing across the width of the channel.'","Published: June 5, 2015"

The center is helping Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies implement a technique called continuous manufacturing that is expected to revolutionize the industry in the coming years and enable companies to deliver the latest medications to patients more quickly, with higher quality and potentially even at lower cost.  Continuous manufacturing, one of the more significant advances in pharmaceutical manufacturing in decades, is important because it is more efficient and less expensive than conventional methods to produce tablets and can help companies introduce new products faster while improving quality control.  Continuous manufacturing represents the future of advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing,  said Fernando J. Muzzio, professor II, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering.  With this latest funding, our center is now better positioned than ever to serve the scientific community, pharmaceutical companies and the regulatory agencies as the industry moves to this new process over the next decade.  Muzzio directs the Engineering Research Center on Structured Organic Particulate Systems (C-SOPS), established at Rutgers nine years ago with funding from the National Science Foundation and a consortium of more than 40 companies within the pharmaceutical sector. It is the world s largest academic-based research organization dedicated to modernizing pharmaceutical manufacturing. The center brings together leading researchers from Rutgers and three partners   the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Purdue University and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez   to work with industry leaders and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would need to approve these manufacturing changes. Pharmaceutical companies have not changed the basic way they manufacture tablets for decades. Raw materials are mixed in large batches, with a final step of pressing material into the shape of tablets. The new method involves feeding these raw materials into a continuously running process. The change is similar to what happened in the automobile industry when cars used to be built one at a time before the introduction of the assembly line. The new system requires a smaller facility, minimizes waste and allows for continuous quality monitoring. As part of this collaboration begun five years ago, Rutgers engineers designed and built one of the first full production-scale continuous manufacturing facilities inside an engineering building on the Piscataway campus. This is being used as the model for a Janssen production line in Puerto Rico that is transitioning to continuous manufacturing, pending FDA approval, and as a model for other pharmaceutical manufacturers. When the line is operating, tablets pass through a series of tubes attached to a two-story tall structure. The tablets are for testing only and are not for patients.  Continuous manufacturing is expected to replace conventional batch processing in the pharmaceutical industry as it has in many other industries, from food to steel production,  said Munzio.  But it will take time and extensive collaboration between government and industry, and that is where our work plays such an important role.  While pharmaceutical companies have been slow to adopt this technology, the pace has accelerated in recent years following explicit support from the FDA. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and a leading advocate for the manufacturing change, recently attended an industry workshop at Rutgers to discuss this and other initiatives.  Our collaboration with the Rutgers Engineering School has been very productive in helping us to prepare for the future by delivering the highest quality medicines in the most efficient way,  said Mauricio Futran, vice president, advanced technology, Janssen Manufacturing & Technical Operations.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Rutgers and with regulators on the advancement and implementation of this important manufacturing technology. ","Published: June 5, 2015"

Continuous flow technology is nearing an inflection point and is poised to transform a series of industries where organic synthesis is core to product development and manufacturing -- affecting a market capitalization value of up to $4 trillion in the global economy. Much has been written on the promise of continuous flow chemistry in manufacturing, which can bring increases in efficiency, safety, and quality, along with significantly reduced operating expenses. Less appreciated, perhaps, is the dramatic impact that the technology could have on new product discovery and development. Continuous flow, for instance, could help researchers discover life-saving medicines by enabling them to search new chemical space using reactions that were infeasible or unreliable in the conventional batch chemistry format. Moreover, these molecules could then be readily scaled to accelerate additional testing for more rapid prototyping in discovery. The reality, though, is that few of the promises of continuous flow chemistry have been realized. More than thirty years since some of the earliest reports of its implementation into select manufacturing processes, continuous flow has not significantly changed the way the industry synthesizes and manufactures organic molecules. Tim Jamison, who is CEO of Snapdragon Chemistry, said, ""One key driver of flow's limited application is the lack of internal resources to investigate and develop the technology. On a related note, there is an overall lack of scientific talent with expertise in flow technology because it's not at all incorporated into chemists' education and training."" Snapdragon Chemistry aims to change the entire narrative around continuous flow technology by providing companies with innovative solutions that leverage Snapdragon's deep technical expertise across chemical synthesis and engineering as well as its proprietary knowledge from developing a broad variety of continuous processes for single reactions and multi-step syntheses. ""Snapdragon Chemistry believes that visualizing solutions through the lens of flow chemistry early in product development is essential not only to unlock its benefits in manufacturing but also to capture significant advantages in R&D,"" says Tim Jamison. Consequently, Snapdragon Chemistry has developed a range of solutions that provides chemists with new tools to speed the discovery and development of medicines and other products and positions these products to be manufactured continuously. For instance, Snapdragon's Reaction Optimization Center of Excellence helps translate desired organic syntheses end-to-end into a continuous flow format -- from reaction and reactor design, to the scaling of a process, to developing multi-step synthesis in one integrated continuous process. Another of its core offerings isportfolio optimization analysis to help companies proactively pinpoint specific areas of opportunity in their portfolio of molecules where conversion to continuous flow synthesis would be feasible and have maximum benefit. ""It is clear that [continuous manufacturing] is how organic molecules will be manufactured in the future, and I am excited to be a part of a cutting-edge company like Snapdragon Chemistry, which will have a big role in helping catalyze this transformation,"" said Klavs Jensen, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT, who is a member of Snapdragon's scientific advisory board. To bring the best to its clients, Snapdragon Chemistry is forming an ecosystem of partners including Paraza Pharma Inc., a best-in-class drug discovery service provider, based in Montreal, Canada, and Zaiput Flow Technologies, a leading manufacturer of advanced tools for continuous flow. Paraza complements Snapdragon Chemistry's expertise, enabling a more holistic service paradigm in the discovery and early development space. In addition, through its partnership with Zaiput Flow Technologies, Snapdragon Chemistry will bring the most innovative and effective continuous flow solutions to clients. Snapdragon Chemistry is headquartered in the Greater Boston area and is a leading provider of flow chemistry solutions and services.

The goal of the research is to identify effective treatment combinations based on Peregrine's PS-targeting agents, including Peregrine's lead clinical agent bavituximab, with other checkpoint inhibitors or immune stimulating agents that will further guide the bavituximab clinical development program. The studies at MSK will be performed under the direction of Taha Merghoub, Ph.D., Associate Attending Biologist, Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Ludwig Collaborative and the Swim Across America Laboratory, a part of the laboratory of Jedd D. Wolchok, M.D., Ph.D., a leader in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Dr. Wolchok serves as the Chief, Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Lloyd J. Old Chair for Clinical Investigation as well as an Associate Director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy at MSK. ""The phosphatidylserine (PS) signaling pathway is a very interesting target for modulating the immune system's response to cancer. We look forward to exploring the potential of PS-targeting agents alone and with other immune modulators that may lead to novel advances in cancer therapy,"" said Dr. Wolchok. As part of the collaboration, researchers at MSK will conduct research to further explore the combination of PS-targeting agents, including bavituximab, that block a primary immunosuppressive pathway thereby allowing anti-tumor immune responses with other immuno-stimulatory agents that enhance immune responses. Specifically, MSK researchers will examine the combination of bavituximab alongside models of checkpoint blockade that are unresponsive to inhibition or co-stimulation given the ability of bavituximab to reprogram myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and increase tumoricidal T-cells in tumors, a mechanism of action that is complementary to checkpoint blockade and T-cell activation. ""A key focus of the Wolchok Lab's research is studying novel immunotherapy combinations that work together to enable the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer. This collaboration will allow us to focus on the role and contribution of PS blockade therapy in determining which combination of the current and next generation of immune modulators is likely to increase the extent and amplitude of anti-tumor response. This important pre-clinical and translational work will potentially guide the design of the next generation of clinical studies with bavituximab,"" said Dr. Merghoub. ""We are delighted to be working with a world-renowned pioneer and leader in the immuno-oncology space, recognizing that there remains significant research in order for more cancer patients to realize the benefits of combination immune therapy,"" said Jeff T. Hutchins, Ph.D., VP of Preclinical Research at Peregrine. ""Our internal and collaborative research presented over the last year has established a robust foundation of PS-targeting activity on which to initiate this next chapter in PS research and development."" ""This collaboration is an important extension of our established research efforts to further explore and understand the potential of our PS-targeting platform including bavituximab our lead clinical candidate. This research will focus on better understanding how treatment with PS-targeting agents can assist other anti-tumor immunotherapies in order to work better,"" said Steven King, chief executive officer of Peregrine. ""Our goal is to change the way cancer patients are treated by allowing their immune system to recognize and fight their disease. This collaboration will undoubtedly assist us in identifying potential new opportunities to better treat patients with cancer."" Peregrine's antibodies target and bind to phosphatidylserine (PS), a highly immunosuppressive molecule normally located on the interior of cellular membranes, but, following stresses in the tumor environment, becomes exposed on tumor cells and cells that line tumor blood vessels, helping tumors to evade immune detection. PS-targeting antibodies block this immunosuppressive signal, thereby enabling the immune system to better recognize and fight the tumor. Preclinical data show that the combination of bavituximab and inhibitors of immune checkpoints reduce tumor-suppressive factors including myeloid-derived suppressor cells and confer increased tumor-specific immunity when compared to either treatment alone.","Published: June 5, 2015"

The drug development and license agreement between Transposagen and Janssen, which was announced in November of 2014, has been transferred to Poseida. The three-year drug development partnership and license agreement will focus on developing at least two allogenic CAR-T product candidates. Poseida will receive milestones payments of up to $292 million per product candidate and tiered royalty payments. Both companies will work together on preclinical development and Janssen will be responsible for manufacturing and commercialization. Poseida has retained the rights to develop its own autologous CAR-T products, as well as allogeneic CAR-NK and non-CAR T-cell therapies. Unlike other companies in this space, Poseida does not use retroviruses, such as lentivirus, to deliver the CAR molecule, but rather piggyback  technology, which is safer, more efficient and estimated to be 10 times cheaper than viral approaches. Importantly, the piggyBac  technology can deliver DNA cargo that is 20 times larger than lentivirus, meaning that more than one CAR molecule, plus safety switches and immune modulators, can all be delivered simultaneously. The 40,000 square foot San Diego JLABS facility features core research labs hosting specialized capital equipment, shared administrative areas and individual bench, wet lab and office modules. JLABS is a  no strings attached  model and the agreement for space does not grant Janssen any ownership stake in Poseida. Heading up the immuno-oncology research effort for Poseida at JLABS is Devon Shedlock, Ph.D., current Director of Immuno-Oncology at Poseida and the former Associate Director of the T-Cell Engineering Core that is part of Carl June s group at the University of Pennsylvania.  Our recent expansion at JLABS greatly facilitates our drug development collaboration with Janssen,  said Eric Ostertag, M.D., Ph.D., CEO of Poseida.   It is wonderful that our scientists can work closely with a team of Janssen scientists on a nearly daily basis, and, having access to Janssen s expertise in the immunology and cellular therapy areas is a tremendous boost to our own CAR-T drug development program.

A neuroscience team at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) reports in Neuron results of experiments that suggest how the mammalian brain distinguishes odors   not just dissimilar ones but, perhaps more importantly, odors that are nearly identical, such as the scents of oranges and tangerines. Precise discrimination of olfactory signals from the environment is nothing less than a survival skill, more so for mice, our mammalian cousins, than for us. Mice have relatively poor vision, and it is only thanks to their other senses, notably their incredible ability to identify and discriminate odors, that they can successfully hunt for food or choose a mate. Understanding how they do this, in turn, sheds light on the workings of our much more complex, but structurally related, brains. Led by CSHL Assistant Professor Florin Albeanu, the team explored a function in the mouse brain that scientists still don t know much about. After a mouse samples a smell by sniffing, and signals from that activity are gathered and subjected to preliminary processing in the animal s olfactory bulb, the bulb sends  output  signals to the brain s higher processing center, the cerebral cortex. Albeanu s team focused on  feedback  -- the signal that the olfactory cortex, in turn, sends back to the olfactory bulb. While there are theories aplenty about the nature and purpose of this feedback signal, very little is known about it. Even in the mouse brain, the feedback loop is a good deal more complex than just described. The olfactory bulb sends output to and receives feedback from multiple parts of the brain. Albeanu s team focused on one such feedback loop: signals sent from two principal cell types in the bulb, called mitral cells and tufted cells. These signals travel over long-distance axons to various parts of the brain, but most prominently to the piriform cortex. That s the brain s primary center for higher olfactory processing. Some theorists have speculated that the piriform cortex works as a pattern-recognition device that compares incoming sensory inputs with representations of previously experienced odors, stored up in memory. Not only is the piriform cortex thought to do this job; it is also involved in the integration of this information with contextual information (ranging from other data about the environment to whether the animal is hungry, amorous, afraid, etc.). Further, it is theorized that based on this data, the piriform cortex sends signals back to the olfactory bulb   feedback   that is essentially predictive, helping the animal to make decisions based on all available information. Albeanu s team, which included co-first authors Drs. Gonzalo Otazu and Hongggo Chae, as well as technician Martin Davis, made a series of discoveries in two related sets of experiments that support some of these theories. In one set, as they exposed awake mice to a panel of about 30 odorants, one by one, they traced the axons projecting back to the olfactory bulb from the piriform cortex   the  wires,  in effect, that carry the feedback signal   and measured the responses of tiny button-like structures called synaptic boutons, the sites where these cortical feedback axons form connections, or synapses, in the bulb with local receiving neurons. These so-called interneurons are inhibitory.  The idea was to image the responses of the boutons in the olfactory bulb to a set of odorants,  explains Albeanu.  It s very hard to physically access the piriform cortex for optical imaging, so we used these boutons as a proxy to indicate the nature of the signal that the cortex is feeding back to the bulb.  The results were  striking,  says Albeanu. First, it was clear that any given bouton responded only to a small fraction of the 30 odorants   perhaps two or three, on average. This is what neuroscientists call a  sparse  response, and it indicates specificity. This immediately cast doubt on an existing theory suggesting that the feedback to the bulb is non-specific and acts like the volume, or  gain,  control on an audio system. Rather, the response was specific and highly selective. Not only did a given bouton respond to very few odors; if it responded to one by amplifying the feedback signal (above the background level, since there is always activity in the circuit), it tended to perform that same function, amplification, on all of the odors it responded to. Conversely, those boutons that tamped down the signal coming back from the cortex tended to do that for all of the odors they responded to. A second set of experiments enabled Albeanu s team to offer a new hypothesis of the purpose of this particular cortical feedback. By injecting mice with a drug that inactivates the piriform cortex, they were able to examine the activity of the output cells in the olfactory bulb that normally integrate the cortical feedback via inhibitory interneurons. Again a striking result: as compared with their activity profiles when receiving feedback, mitral cells in the olfactory bulb tended to have overlapping responses when the feedback was cut off. In other words, their activity profiles started to look quite similar. This suggests that without feedback from the cortex, mitral cells are no longer able to supply the animal with information that can sharply distinguish odors, particularly odors that are chemically similar. Taken together, the results lead Albeanu to propose that feedback from the cortex is highly specific, and likely used to create a useful representation of the animal s environment,  in a very specific and selective fashion that, in turn, is used to extract the identity of a given odor and to separate it from other odors,  Albeanu says. The research continues now in experiments featuring animals that are actively engaged in odor discrimination in their environment, in order to obtain behavioral evidence to correlate with the results of the experiments published today.

These results give us a better understanding of memory s architecture and, specifically, how molecules act as a network in creating long-term memories,  explains the paper s senior author, Thomas Carew, a professor in NYU s Center for Neural Science and dean of NYU s Faculty of Arts and Science.  More importantly, this marks another step toward elucidating the intricacies of memory function, which is vital in the development of cognitive therapies to address related afflictions.  The importance of growth factor molecules (GFs) has long been known. They are critical in building brains beginning in utero and until adulthood. Moreover, over time, it s been established that GFs are  recycled  from brain builders to engineers of long-term memories. Less clear, however, is how the wide range of GF families, as well as different members within each family, act to help us create these memories. In working to address this question, the NYU research team, which also included graduate student Ashley Kopec, the study s lead author, and research scientist Gary Philips, focused on two GF families: TrkB and TGF r-II, which represent two distinct classes of GFs that utilize different types of receptors to exert their actions in the brain. In their study, the researchers examined GFs in Aplysia californica, the California sea slug. Aplysia is a model organism that is quite powerful for this type of research because its neurons are 10 to 50 times larger than those of higher organisms, such as vertebrates, and it possesses a relatively small network of neurons characteristics that readily allow for the examination of molecular signaling during memory formation. Specifically, to produce a form of  threat memory  called sensitization in a simple reflex system of Aplysia, the researchers presented the sea slugs with a pair of mild tail shocks delivered 45 minutes apart the first to instill a  molecular context  in the neurons of the reflex and the second to use that context to drive molecular mechanisms that are required to form a long-term memory   and then examined GF activity at both periods, Time 1 and Time 2. Their results showed differences in the role of these two GF families across two dimensions: time and space. At Time 1, when the context for the memory is first created, TrkB plays a critical role while TGF r-II is irrelevant. However, at Time 2, when a long-term memory is actually formed, the roles are reversed: TGF r-II is active, but TrkB is insignificant. In addition, the results showed spatial differences. In Aplysia, the simple neural circuit that mediates the reflex modified by learning is made up of unique sensory neurons and motor neurons. The sensory neurons  cell bodies live in one compartment of the brain while their companion synapses, which pass along signals to other cells, reside in another. In the Neuron study, the researchers found that the TrkB effects are exerted only at synapses while TGF r-II functions only at the cell body. Overall the study provides new insights into how different GF families play unique roles both in time and in space, thus helping to elucidate the  when,   where,  and  how  of memory formation.

In a study published in Human Brain Mapping, the researchers unveil an ultra high-resolution brain stem model that could better guide brain surgeons treating conditions such as tremors and Parkinson's disease with deep brain stimulation (DBS). The new 3-D model could eliminate risky trial-and-error as surgeons implant electrodes -- a change akin to trading an outdated paper road atlas for a real-time GPS. ""On the conventional MRI that we take before surgery, the thalamus looks like a gray mass where you can see only the borders,"" said neurosurgeon Nandan Lad, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Duke NeuroOutcomes Center and an author of the paper. ""Now we will have actual detail. With this map, for the first time we're able to see the thalamus and that underlying circuitry that we are modulating."" Many neurosurgeons currently rely on lower resolution CT and MRI scans and geographic coordinates relative to the planes of the brain to guide them when placing electrodes into the thalamus. They are targeting a circuit called the dentatorubrothalamic tract or DRT (depicted as an X-shaped pathway in the accompanying image), Lad said. Surgeons must often remove and reinsert electrodes and test frequencies to find the spots inside the thalamus where, for instance, the electric current subdues the hands of a patient with debilitating tremors. This indirect targeting is the standard of care for DBS, but comes with risk. Moving an electrode requires another pass through delicate tissue, and complications from DBS can include hemorrhage, seizure, or memory problems. ""This map will potentially help us reach the optimal target the first time,"" Lad said. ""It could eliminate trial and error and make the surgery safer."" The map was produced from a 10-day scan of a healthy donor's postmortem brain stem in a 7-Tesla MRI system, and then converted into a 3-D model that can be proportionally scaled to fit a person's unique brain anatomy using a high-performance computing cluster. ""These images are 1,000 times more detailed than a clinical MRI,"" said G. Allan Johnson, senior author of the paper and director of the Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy where the brain stem was scanned. ""You can actually see the nerve fibers in the brain, how they're crossing, and the subtleties of contrast between gray and white matter in the brain far beyond what a clinical scan could offer."" To test the accuracy of the model, the researchers conducted a retrospective study of 12 patients who had already been treated successfully for tremors using DBS. The researchers used the 3-D model to predict the best placement for the electrodes in each patient. The predictive computer model and the actual successful electrode placements correlated for 22 of 24 electrodes in the dozen patients, the study showed. The researchers will soon begin a prospective study using the 3-D model to guide DBS surgery. ""As time goes on, imaging will only continue to get better,"" Lad said. ""We are well-equipped and at the cutting edge of understanding how to apply this technology, and will be in an even better position to treat more patients with fewer side effects."" The Duke team will also pursue high resolution imaging of other circuits in the brain, brain stem and spinal cord to develop new treatments for other conditions. ""We now have a guide to be able to visualize these complex neuronal connections that would otherwise be impossible to see,"" said Evan Calabrese, Ph.D., the lead author of the paper who engineered the 3-D model. ""This will help us continue to explore applications for treatments of Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, depression and even obsessive compulsive disorders."" Duke Medicine Johnson GA et al.

These nerve cells that are presumed to exist in a similar form in humans, give the start signal for locomotion and also supply the brain with speed-related information. Scientists at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the University of Bonn led by Prof. Stefan Remy report on this in the journal Neuron. Their investigations give new insights into the workings of spatial memory. Furthermore, they could also help improve our understanding of movement related symptoms associated with Parkinson s disease. In a familiar environment our movements are purposeful. For example, if we leave our office desk for a coffee break, we naturally follow a predefined route that has been stored in our memory: Through the office door, left into the hall, past the windows. To keep us on track, our brain has to process varying sensory impressions quickly.  This is a fundamental issue our brain has to deal with. Not just on our way to the coffee machine, but any time we move in space. For example when we are on a bike or in a car,  explains Remy. With increasing speed, the data rate also increases, he emphasizes:  The faster we move, the less time the brain has to take in environmental cues and to associate them with a location on our memorized spatial map. Our perception therefore has to keep pace with the speed of movement so that we remember the right way to go. Otherwise we end up at the copy machine instead of the coffee machine.  It has been known for some time that the hippocampus - the part of the brain that controls memory, particularly spatial memory - adjusts to the speed of locomotion.  The electrical activity of the hippocampus undergoes rhythmic fluctuations. The faster we move, the faster certain nerve cells are activated,  says Remy.  This increased activation rate sensitizes the brain. It becomes more receptive to the changing sensory impressions that have to be processed when moving.  But how does the brain actually know how fast a movement is? Previously there was no answer to this question. Now, Remy and his colleagues have decoded the mechanism. For this, they stimulated specific areas within the mouse brain and recorded the ensuing brain activity and the mice s locomotion.  We have identified the neural circuits in mice that link their spatial memory to the speed of their movement. This interplay is an important foundation for a functioning spatial memory,  says Remy.  We assume that humans have similar nerve cells, as the brains of mice and humans have a very similar structure in these regions.  The cells in question are located in the  medial septum , a part of the brain directly connected to the hippocampus. They make up a relatively small group comprising a few thousand cells.  They gather information from sensory and locomotor systems, determine the speed of movement and transmit this information to the hippocampus. In this way, they tune the spatial memory systems for optimized processing of sensory stimuli during locomotion,  explains Remy. However, these circuits have even more functions.  We have found that they also give the start signal for locomotion and that they actively control its speed. Until now, this control function was almost exclusively ascribed to the motor cerebral cortex.  These newly discovered nerve cells are linked with areas of the brain that are affected by Parkinson s in humans. This disease is associated with movement-related symptoms and can cause dementia.  In this respect, our results go beyond the workings of spatial memory; they also have the potential to provide new insights into how memory systems and the execution of movements are affected in Parkinson s disease,  says Remy.

Genomics England also said that Lockheed Martin, in partnership with Cypher Genomics, has been selected as a reserve bidder. The selected companies are expected to begin providing services on Aug. 1, 2015. They'll be expected to provide interpretation services from within the Genomics England data center. This phase of the project is expected to be completed within 12 months. ""This is an important milestone for the project,"" Augusto Rendon, Genomics England's director of bioinformatics, said in a statement. ""We are looking to provide high-quality variant interpretation to assist clinicians within the NHS, and these companies will enable us to deliver this service. We look forward to working with each of the successful companies over the next year."" Genomics England first launched a bake off to identify vendors that could provide annotation and interpretation tools and services for the 100,000 Genomes Project in spring 2014. That initial call attracted 28 participants, each of which was asked to interpret the genomes of 15 rare disease trio samples and 10 cancer/normal samples. Ten companies were selected from this initial pool for a follow-up phase, under which companies were asked to participate in a tender to provide interpretation services for the first 8,000 patients being treated within the project.   Genomics England intends to use the lessons it learns during this phase of the project to make decisions about contracts for its future clinical interpretation needs in early 2016. Meanwhile, it will continue to work with Illumina and intends to expand its partnership with the instrument vendor to explore various bioinformatics challenges around sequencing and clinical interpretation.","Published: June 4, 2015"

But new pages are still being added to that atlas: maps of chemical markers called methyl groups that stud strands of DNA and influence which genes are repressed and when. Now, Salk scientists have constructed the most comprehensive maps yet of these chemical patterns collectively called the epigenome in more than a dozen different human organs from individual donors (including a woman, man and child). While the methylation does not change an individual s inherited genetic sequence, research has increasingly shown it has a profound effect on development and health. ""What we found is that not all organs we surveyed are equal in terms of their methylation patterns,  said senior author Joseph R. Ecker, professor and director of Salk's Genomic Analysis Laboratory and codirector of The Center of Excellence for Stem Cell Genomics.  The signatures of methylation are distinct enough between organs that we can look at the methylation patterns of a tissue and know whether the tissue is muscle or thymus or pancreas.  While the genome of an individual is the same in every cell, epigenomes vary since they are closely related to the genes a cell is actually using at any given time. Methylation marks help blood cells ignore the genes required to be a brain or liver cell, for instance. And they can vary over time a change in a person s age, diet or environment, for instance, has been shown to affect methylation.  We wanted to make a baseline assessment of what the epigenome, in particular DNA methylation, looks like in normal human organs,  said Ecker. To do that, the scientists collected cells from 18 organs in 4 individuals and mapped out their methylation profiles.  As expected, the patterns aligned somewhat with genes known to be important for a cell s function there was less methylation close to muscle genes in cells collected from muscle, for instance. But other aspects of the new maps were surprising. The researchers detected an unusual form of methylation, called non-CG methylation, which was thought to be widespread only in the brain and stem cells.  The only place this had been observed before was in the brain, skeletal muscle, germ cells and stem cells,  said Matthew Schultz, formerly a graduate student in the Ecker lab and a first author of the new work.  So, to see it in a variety of normal adult tissues was really exciting.  Researchers don t yet know the function of that non-CG methylation in adults, but hypothesize that it may suggest the presence of stem cell populations in the adult tissues.  The team found other surprises in their research, which point to new avenues to explore. For example, they found that many regions showing dynamic methylation aren t located where expected in a section of DNA called the promoter, as well as the regulatory regions that are upstream of the promoter.  In the past, people have really thought the promoter or the upstream regions are where everything is happening,  said Ecker, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation investigator.  But we found that methylation changes that are most correlated with gene transcription are often in the downstream regions of the promoter.  The observation could affect how and where researchers search for methylation when they re studying how an individual gene is regulated. Another surprise was how extensively organs differed from each other in the degree of genome-wide methylation. The pancreas had an unusually low level of methylation, while the thymus had high levels of methylation. Researchers don t yet know why. The new results just scratch the surface of completely understanding DNA methylation patterns there are dozens more organs to profile, numerous unknowns about what shapes and changes the epigenome, and questions about whether different cells even within a single organ vary in their methylation patterns.  What would be interesting to do next is split out different cell types,  said Yupeng He, a graduate student in the Ecker lab and co-first author of the new paper.  The samples we have are heterogeneous mixtures of many cells.  The researchers hope the results offer a jumping off point, however, to start understanding how diseases, such as those affecting the organs they profiled, may be reflected in changes to the epigenome.  You could imagine that eventually, if someone is having a problem, a biopsy might not only look at characterizing the cells or genes, but the epigenome as well,  said Ecker.","Published: June 4, 2015"

It is important to study virus particles because they are everywhere on our Earth and in enormous numbers. They are not all bad for humans and, in fact, it could be said that bacteriophages are essential for life as we know it,  Bier said.  We need to understand the good from the bad to better understand nature and how we can best take advantage of these molecular forms. Image: Carnegie Mellon Univ. Mass spectrometers separate ionized molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratio. One limitation of mass spectrometry is in the analysis of macromolecules. Most instruments are unable to efficiently detect such large molecules at low charge states or must resort to creating high charge states that require high-resolution mass analysis. As a result, most researchers don t analyze whole macromolecules. Instead, they break down macromolecules into smaller parts in wet chemistry laboratories and analyze the subunits. While effective, this wet lab process can be time consuming and doesn t allow researchers to study intact macromolecules directly in the gas phase. Because of their size, which can be more than a million times larger than a water molecule, viruses are one type of molecular complex that has seen only limited study by scientists using mass spectrometry. To overcome the high mass limitations, Bier s group uses a cryodetector-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometer, called a Macromizer, that has 16 superconducting tunnel junction detectors. The 3.75-m-long apparatus can analyze low charge heavy ions with a significantly higher signal than mass spectrometers with standard ionizing detectors. Carnegie Mellon is home to the only known active cryodetector mass spectrometer research lab in the U.S. and Bier s group also is developing the next generation cryodetector mass spectrometer. Using samples of cowpea mosaic virus gathered and purified by the lab of Case Western Reserve Univ. s Nicole Steinmetz, Bier s team used mass spectrometry to weigh and separate a mixture of two variants of the virus. One contained RNA1 and weighed 5.65 megadaltons; the second contained RNA2 and weighed 4.84 megadaltons. These weights were close to the theoretical weights that had been proposed for the virus particles. Bier hopes that the technique, which he calls a form of  heavy ion mass spectrometry,  can be used to analyze and study other viruses, and will be helpful in understanding the robustness of viral structure, the mechanics behind viral infection and provide new ways of virus detection and treatment. He also plans to continue to use the technique to study other types of heavy ions.","Published: June 4, 2015"

Though scientists have been using them for about five years, nobody was sure exactly how the protein complexes homed in on particular genomic regions. ""TALENs do not possess the common canonical elements such as helix-turn-helix or leucine zipper motifs found in other DNA-binding proteins capable of sequence-specific recognition,"" the authors wrote in the paper, so how the proteins found their target sites was somewhat of a mystery. ""They are designed to bind to a particular site, but there's this big genome with billions of bases,"" Charles Schroeder, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and a senior author of the paper said in a statement. To find out, the researchers used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to watch individual TALENs interacting with strings of DNA in a single-molecule assay based on dual-tethered DNA. They found that the proteins slide along and jump around the genome as they search the genome for their target. ""The combination of sliding and hopping means they can cover more ground and potentially move past obstacles that might be in their way,"" said Luke Cuculis, a co-lead author of the paper. It also allows the protein to access both strands of DNA to find its target site. The scientists also found that there are two important modes of activity: search and sequence recognition. Within the protein's structure, the scientists found a domain responsible for each mode, an N-Terminal Region domain that is responsible for searching the genome and a central repeat domain that binds to the specified target sequence. Understanding these domains could help address one of the most problematic side effects of genome editing, off-target activity. ""The major goal would be to engineer improved proteins that have lower off-target binding. You don't want them to bind to the wrong place,"" Schroeder said. ""If we engineer a protein in such a way where we don't just naively change the specific binding domain, but design a new protein with distinct parts of the protein in different places, we might be able to increase the efficiency without increasing mistakes."" The experiments were performed in microfluidic flow cells containing a field of DNA templates, so the researchers said their next step is to look at TALEN activity in a live cell nucleus.","Published: June 4, 2015"

The first viruses of this family were discovered in a place known as Bunyamwera in Uganda, from which they derive their name. ""The most well-known bunyaviruses include, for example, the Rift Valley fever virus, which can cause febrile illnesses with severe bleeding in humans,"" says Dr. Sandra Junglen from the Bonn Institute of Virology, also affiliated with the German Center for Infection Research. In 2011, the ""Schmallenberg virus"" gained much attention: also a part of the Bunyavirus family and transmitted by gnats, it caused severe fetal malformations in ruminant animals including sheep in the German Sauerland region.  Not in Schmallenberg but instead in the African tropical forest of the Ivory Coast, where the virologist has been conducting research for more than ten years, she set off on the search for new viruses. Because most  bunyaviruses are transmitted by blood-sucking insects, Dr. Junglen caught more than 7500 mosquitoes. Sorted according to species and sites of capture, the scientists combined the captured mosquitoes into 432 mixed samples. In 26 of these samples, the researchers discovered particles of unknown bunyaviruses.  ""These were two groups of as-yet-unknown viruses which we called Jonchet virus and Ferak virus,"" reports the virologist. The scientists obtained fragments of the viral genetic material from the insect samples and joined these fragments together like a puzzle, thus reconstructing the entire genome sequence. ""That alone took four years,"" reported lead authors Marco Marklewitz and Florian Zirkel. During the comparison of the genetic information with other viruses, it was found that Jonchet and Ferak viruses are two phylogenetically independent bunyavirus lineages. How dangerous are the two new groups of viruses   can they be easily transmitted to humans and animals? To answer these questions, the scientists went in a new direction: They performed infection trials in a large number of cell cultures at different temperature levels. While pathogenic bunyaviruses can multiply at temperatures that include the human body temperature, growth of Jonchet and Ferak viruses ceases above 32 degrees Celsius, making it unlikely that the viruses infect humans or other vertebrates. ""In addition, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of host associations of the entire family of viruses, demonstrating for the first time that viruses affecting vertebrates developed from arthropod-specific viruses,"" says the researcher from the University of Bonn Hospital.

This degradation process    autophagy    is linked to several diseases. Although recent studies have suggested that selective autophagy targeted at specific cell constituents may also be responsible for maintaining healthy conditions in the cell    homeostasis    the extent of these processes is unknown. Now researchers at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama City University and the Japan Science and Technology Agency have identified two new proteins that drive selective autophagy. They also show the role of these new autophagy pathways in preserving the cell in nutrient-limiting conditions. The researchers focused their study on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During selective autophagy, an autophagosomal membrane extends over the target through the binding of autophagy receptors to Atg8 proteins. By looking for proteins that bound to Atg8 in the yeast, Hitoshi Nakatogawa and colleagues identified two new autophagy receptor proteins: Atg39 and Atg40. The researchers noted that Atg39 and Atg40 levels increased in the presence of the chemical rapamycin, which mimics nitrogen starvation. Further studies linked the two proteins to autophagy of a certain cell constituent   the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a network of flattened membrane enclosed sacks   in nitrogen-starved conditions. The same conditions also triggered degradation of a part of the nucleus by Atg39; this protein localized to a special part of the ER surrounding the nucleus. Atg40 localized to other ER regions and mediated their degradation. Blocking nucleus degradation by Atg39 led to cell death in nitrogen-starved conditions. Atg40 was suggested to correspond to a human protein encoded by FAM134B, a causative gene for a hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy.  Our results provide fundamental insight into the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms of  ER-phagy  and  nucleophagy  in other organisms,  explain the researchers in their report of the work. Further studies are required to determine the ER components that must be degraded as well as whether the purpose of this autophagy process is removal of material or making substances available through the breakdown.","Published: June 4, 2015"

These HDx  Reference standards, being developed by Horizon Diagnostics, a division of Horizon, will support proficiency testing of CareDx s solid organ transplant injury monitoring diagnostic tests and will be integrated into CLIA laboratory testing. HDx Reference Standards offer a source of genetically defined, quantitative, sustainable and independent third party reference material, critical to the validation and routine performance monitoring of CareDx s next generation sequencing (NGS) based donor-derived cfDNA (dd-cfDNA) diagnostic assay. The reference standards mimic plasma cfDNA both in size and abundance in transplant setting and are the first commercially available standards of their kind. Horizon Diagnostics uses its proprietary genome engineering platforms to precisely engineer highly characterized parental cell lines. Horizon Diagnostics then generates mixtures at very precise allelic frequencies, verified by digital PCR, ranging between 0.1% and 50%. CareDx s cfDNA test is designed to monitor injury to transplanted organs, in particular heart and kidney in transplant recipients to allow clinicians to better manage patient health outcomes. There are approximately 300,000 solid organ transplant patients living in the US. The assay amplifies approximately 250 loci of the human genome to identify transplant donor-recipient pairs with diverse ancestral heritage as well as those with close familial relationships. The CareDx cfDNA assay offers a simpler alternative to assays requiring donor and recipient genotyping to simplify assay implementation. CareDx s cfDNA test follows recent guidance for next generation sequencing (NGS) outlined by Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP), American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The targeted assay was recognized in the ""What's Hot, What's New"" session at the American Transplant Congress in Philadelphia on May 6, 2015. Dr. Paul Morrill, President, Products Business, Horizon, said:  This new collaboration with CareDx demonstrates the importance of well validated controls when developing clinical assays, especially as technologies such as NGS become more widely adopted for diagnostic use.

The data has been obtained from the clinical Phase I AEGIS trial examining 4SC-205 in various dosing schemes in 59 patients with advanced solid tumours. 4SC-205 inhibits specifically the human kinesin spindle protein Eg5 (Kif 11), which has been shown to play a crucial role in mitosis (cell division) and, therefore, in tumour growth. To 4SC's knowledge, 4SC-205 is the only orally available Eg5 inhibitor in clinical development worldwide. The ASCO poster can be downloaded from the 4SC website at http://www.4sc.de/product-pipeline/publikationen-poster/4SC-205. Since the Eg5 target molecule is present in the cell only during mitosis, and since mitoses in humans - in contrast to preclinical models - are very rare events of limited duration (approx. 30 minutes per mitosis), it is necessary to ensure continuous exposure of 4SC-205. This means that potentially efficacious and tolerable levels of the compound must be permanently available in patients in order to become effective immediately as soon as mitosis occurs. Conducted at two study centres in Germany, the first-in-man, open-label AEGIS dose escalation and dose-schedule finding study investigated the oral administration of 4SC-205 in patients with advanced solid tumours. Initially, the compound was tested in a conventional, intermittent dosing scheme (consisting of higher single doses and longer breaks between treatments). Given its oral availability and its mechanism of action as a potential inhibitor of mitosis (cell division), 4SC-205 was subsequently examined in a daily (continuous) dosing scheme consisting of smaller single daily doses without breaks between treatments. The objective of the study was to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, and to determine a recommended Phase II dose. The trial ended when treatment of the last patient was completed in the first quarter of 2015. The data in detail: Good profiles of safety and tolerability, linear pharmacokinetic parameters, 20 mg daily dose of 4SC-205 recommended as Phase II dose  A comprehensive safety and tolerability profile of 4SC-205 was established. Specifically, no peripheral neuropathies were observed. This side effect is typically observed in connection with conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes. This means that the approach of a targeted, anti-mitotic therapy, during which these side effects should not occur, was confirmed.  The main side effects were neutropenia in the intermittent dosing scheme. At a daily dose of 20 mg the neutropenia development was well manageable.  The oral compound demonstrated very good linear pharmacokinetic parameters, which is an ideal prerequisite for daily dosage.  A pharmacodynamic biomarker is regulated in a dose-dependent manner, even at a low daily dose.  The daily dose of 20 mg is recommended as the dose for further Phase II development of the compound. This dose was safe and well-tolerated by patients and furthermore demonstrated initial signs of clinical efficacy.  An additional, positive result of the daily dose of 20 mg of 4SC-205 was the median time on treatment of 162 days, thus being four times longer than the time on treatment seen in the intermittent treatment regime (42 days). Moreover, 67% of patients in the 20 mg daily cohort showed disease stabilisation for more than 100 days. Enno Spillner, CEO of 4SC AG, commented: ""We are pleased with the successful completion of the AEGIS trial. 4SC-205 very specifically inhibits an interesting therapeutic target in anti-cancer treatment, the Eg5 protein, which plays an important role in cell mitosis and tumour growth. Since 4SC-205 is orally available, we were able to evaluate this compound as the first of its kind in a clinically promising continuous dosing scheme. In this process we identified a safe and potentially effective dose for possible future Phase II trials. We are currently reviewing scenarios of further clinical development and will intensify discussions with clinical experts and potential academic and industry partners.""","Published: June 4, 2015"

The study, in collaboration with Prof. Bart Neyns from the University Hospital Brussels, showed that BRAF oncogene mutations monitored in plasma from metastatic melanoma patients on Biocartis  Idylla  system were significantly associated with treatment response and progression. Idylla  is a fully automated diagnostic platform designed to offer fast access to molecular diagnostic information from virtually any clinical sample type. In the current study, Biocartis developed a prototype product on its Idylla  system for the analysis of BRAF mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma samples. The prototype integrates and fully automates extraction of ctDNA and powerful selective amplification enabling the sensitive detection of BRAF V600 mutations from 1 ml of plasma. Liquid biopsies utilize circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) directly from patient blood samples to determine a tumor's genetic make-up. Liquid biopsies are expected to play an important role in cancer treatment in the future. As this process is much less invasive than traditional biopsies, it could become a powerful approach for diagnosis, monitoring of treatment response and follow-up of patients after remission. In collaboration with Prof. Bart Neyns  team at the Department of Medical Oncology, Brussels, 232 plasma samples from 41 patients with metastatic melanoma were analyzed for circulating levels of mutant BRAF using Idylla . The findings showed, among others, that BRAF V600 mutations in plasma detected by Idylla  were significantly associated with disease progression, and preceded or coincided with disease progression on imaging in 100% of cases, while the mutations remained absent in patients with a good prognosis. These observations are in line with a study presented by Dr. Janku (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA) at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April of this year. These findings indicate that monthly monitoring of BRAF mutant ctDNA is likely to be useful for patient management in metastatic melanoma, which will be further validated in prospective trials. Geert Maertens, Chief Scientific Officer of Biocartis, commented:  These data demonstrate Idylla s potential application in liquid biopsies. We look forward to continuing our evaluations of ctDNA analysis in melanoma (BRAF) and colorectal cancer (extended RAS), where Idylla allows highly sensitive monitoring of 40 mutations at the same time.

MOR208 is a potent anti-CD19 antibody with a proprietary modification to the Fc portion that is being developed to treat B-cell malignancies. The data, which were presented at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, are from an ongoing phase 2a study of patients with four different subtypes of relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The clinical data show that MOR208 is well tolerated with a low level of infusion reactions and demonstrates encouraging single-agent activity. Based on these encouraging results, MorphoSys plans to advance MOR208 into two combination trials in DLBCL. ""The results for MOR208 have matured significantly since we presented the program at ASH 2014 with two additional complete remissions reported and first-published results for the duration of response. It is worth noting that MOR208 was used as monotherapy in this trial, and the good tolerability we observed supports our plans to test combinations with other drugs,"" commented Dr. Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys AG. ""The results we've seen in the clinic justify our ambitious program for this exciting drug candidate, which include two subsequent studies evaluating MOR208 in combination with lenalidomide and bendamustine to treat DLBCL."" The preliminary data presented at ASCO summarize efficacy and safety results for 92 heavily pre-treated patients. The overall response rate was 28% across all four subtypes of NHL and reached 36% in the DLBCL subgroup (both based on evaluable patients). At the time of the analysis, the majority of responders - 16 out of 21 - had an ongoing response to the treatment. The longest response duration observed so far exceeded 14.2 months in DLBCL, 15.4 months in FL and 10.8 months in other iNHL. The open-label, phase 2a, multicenter study was designed to assess the activity and safety of single-agent MOR208 in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and other indolent NHL (iNHL), who had received at least one prior rituximab-containing therapy. Patients were initially treated with a total of eight weekly doses of 12 mg/kg MOR208. Those with at least stable disease stayed on MOR208 treatment for an additional four weeks. After completion of these twelve weekly doses of treatment, responding patients, who demonstrated at least partial response received maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","Published: June 4, 2015"

Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh examined the data and contributed to this abstract at ERA-EDTA. He has also contributed to additional abstracts that have been submitted for peer review presentation. In the pooled analysis from the SUSTAIN and ASSURE trials (n=499), assessment of the metabolic biomarker ALP, revealed a significant reduction of -10.98% in all RVX-208 treated patients (n=331) compared to a reduction of -3.23% in placebo treated patients (n=168) (p<0.0001) at the combined time points of 24 and 26 weeks. In addition, several subgroup analysis were performed. In patients with a history of diabetes, a significant reduction in ALP of -13.9% was observed in the RVX-208 treated group (n=127) compared to -4.49% in the placebo treated group (n=65) (p<0.0001). Further analysis was performed on patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In this group, RVX-208 treated patients (n=35) had reduced ALP levels of -13.9% versus -6.28% in placebo (n=13) (p=0.008). In addition, following 6 months of RVX-208 treatment, an increase in eGFR of +3.4% (p=0.04 vs. baseline) in the RVX-208 treated group was observed compared to a decrease of -5.9% in the placebo group.","Published: June 4, 2015"

This is one of our most promising clinical candidates, as reflected by the out-licensing agreement we recently signed with Omega Pharma, and by the excellent results of the clinical trial. The results not only show that BL-5010 is highly effective in removing seborrheic keratosis, but also that 94.6% of the investigators and 84% of the patients who participated in the trial reported that they were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcome of the treatment and that the results were good or excellent 180 days following treatment. BL-5010 offers a novel method for removing skin lesions without surgery, anesthesia or significant adverse effects, and we look forward to seeing this innovative product on the market."" The publication details the results, which were previously disclosed by BioLineRx in December 2010, of an open-label, single-arm trial conducted in 60 patients with seborrheic keratosis in Germany and the Netherlands. The objectives of the study were to determine the safety and efficacy of BL-5010 in completely removing the lesion and to assess the cosmetic outcome of the novel treatment. The study also aimed at evaluating BL-5010 s feasibility in preserving the lesions for subsequent histological examination. The results of the trial show that for nearly all patients (96.7%), the lesion fell off within 30 days of a single application of BL-5010. Furthermore, the results show that BL-5010 has a good safety profile, as no persistent irreversible adverse effects were observed at the treated site. Histological examination of the lesions showed that BL-5010 enables preservation of the histological structure of the treated lesion. In December 2014, BL-5010 was out-licensed to Omega Pharma, one of the largest OTC healthcare companies in Europe, for OTC indications in the territory of Europe, Australia and additional selected countries.

The study represents the first glimpse into how domestic cats perceive bitterness in food at a molecular level, and could explain why cats are sometimes such picky eaters. The ability to detect bitter chemicals is thought to have evolved because of its utility in avoiding toxic compounds often found in plants. All cats, from pets to wild tigers, are carnivores that consume little plant material. Domestic cats, however, may still encounter bitter flavors in food and medicines. Domestic cats have a reputation of being rather unpredictable in their dietary choices. This could be explained by their perception of bitter, which differs from that of other mammals due to variations in their repertoire of bitter receptors. It is the goal of many pharmaceutical and food manufacturers to identify compounds that either block or alter bitter perception, to create a more palatable product. The teams at AFB International and Integral Molecular studied the behavior of two different cat bitter taste receptors in cell-based experiments, investigating their responsiveness to bitter compounds, and comparing these to the human versions of these receptors. TAS2R38 is a bitter taste receptor in humans of which some people have 'supertaster' variants that give them an extreme sensitivity to bitter compounds, explaining some people's strong aversions to broccoli and brussels sprouts. Compared with the human TAS2R38 receptor, the cat version was tenfold less sensitive to a key bitter compound PTC and did not respond at all to another bitter compound PROP. Like its human counterpart, the cat bitter taste receptor Tas2r43 was activated by bitter compounds aloin (found in the aloe plant) and denatonium (used to deter children and pets from consuming chemicals such as antifreeze) but responded differently to the compounds. The cat receptor was less sensitive to aloin and more sensitive to denatonium than the human receptor. It also differed from the human taste receptor by being insensitive to saccharin, an artificial sweetener that tends to have a bitter aftertaste in humans. Co-author Nancy Rawson from AFB International, a pet food flavor company, said: 'We confront the challenge of 'finicky cats' every day. As such, it is exciting to find an unexpected receptor response to bitter compounds that has never been described in the literature to date for any other species. These insights and future discoveries will be invaluable in formulating appealing food for cats, as well as enhancing the acceptability of their medications.' Co-author Joseph Rucker from Integral Molecular, a biotechnology company, said: 'Feline bitter taste has not been well studied. We applied our experience in studying membrane proteins, such as taste receptors, to enable this first glimpse into how domestic cats perceive bitterness in food at a molecular level. We were surprised to see that one of the cat taste receptors responded to a more limited range of bitter compounds compared to humans, suggesting that cats may be detecting a narrower, or at least a different, repertoire of bitter-tasting compounds.' The team also found that probenecid, a known inhibitor of human bitter taste receptors, also worked on both cat taste receptors, preventing stimulation when in the presence of PTC, aloin and denatonium. The team says that these insights and further study could be instrumental in formulating appetizing food for household cats as well as designing masking agents to enhance the acceptability of medications.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-shows-benefits-multi-tasking-exercise-283302,Study shows benefits of multi tasking on exercise Who says you can t do two things at once and do them both well  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Who says you can t do two things at once and do them both well? A new University of Florida (UF) study challenges the notion that multi-tasking causes one or both activities to suffer. In a study of older adults who completed cognitive tasks while cycling on a stationary bike, UF researchers found that participants  cycling speed improved while multi-tasking with no cost to their cognitive performance. Results of the study, which was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging, were published in the journal PLoS ONE. The discovery was a surprise finding for investigators Lori Altmann, an associate professor of speech, language and hearing sciences at the College of Public Health and Health Professions, and Chris Hass, an associate professor of applied physiology and kinesiology in the College of Health and Human Performance. They originally set out to determine the degree to which dual task performance suffers in patients with Parkinson s disease. To do this, the researchers had a group of patients with Parkinson s and a group of healthy older adults complete a series of increasingly difficult cognitive tests while cycling.  Every dual-task study that I m aware of shows when people are doing two things at once they get worse,  Altmann said.  Everybody has experienced walking somewhere in a hurry when the person in front of them pulls out a phone, and that person just slows to a crawl. Frankly, that s what we were expecting.  Participants  cycling speed was about 25 percent faster while doing the easiest cognitive tasks but became slower as the cognitive tasks became more difficult. Yet, the hardest tasks only brought participants back to the speeds at which they were cycling before beginning the cognitive tasks. The findings suggest that combining the easier cognitive tasks with physical activity may be a way to get people to exercise more vigorously. The researchers plan to make this a topic for future research.  As participants were doing the easy tasks, they were really going to town on the bikes, and they didn t even realize it,  Altmann said.  It was as if the cognitive tasks took their minds off the fact that they were pedaling.  During the study, 28 participants with Parkinson s disease and 20 healthy older adults completed 12 cognitive tasks while sitting in a quiet room and again while cycling. Tasks ranged in difficulty from saying the word  go  when a blue star was shown on a projection screen to repeating increasingly long lists of numbers in reverse order of presentation. A video motion capture system recorded participants  cycling speed. Their cycling speed was faster while performing the cognitive tasks, with the most improvement during the six easiest cognitive tasks. Cognitive performance while cycling was similar to baseline across all tasks. The reasons for participants  multi-tasking success most likely include multiple factors, the researchers say, but they hypothesize that one explanation could be the cognitive arousal that happens when people anticipate completing a difficult cognitive task. Similarly, exercise increases arousal in regions of the brain that control movement. Arousal increases the release of neurotransmitters that improve speed and efficiency of the brain, particularly the frontal lobes, thus improving performance in motor and cognitive tasks.  What arousal does is give you more attention to focus on a task,  Altmann said.  When the tasks were really easy, we saw the effect of that attention as people cycled very fast. As the cognitive tasks got harder, they started impinging on the amount of attention available to perform both tasks, so participants didn t cycle quite so fast.  Study participants with Parkinson s disease cycled slower overall and didn t speed up as much as the healthy older adults. That could be because arousal that stems from cognitive and physical exercise is dependent on dopamine and other neurotransmitters, which are impaired in people with Parkinson s. Altmann and Hass are currently studying whether multi-tasking benefits will extend to other types of exercise, including use of an elliptical trainer. They hope to eventually examine whether pairing mental tasks with exercise can lead to both cognitive and fitness improvements in older adults. University of Florida   press release Hass CJ et al.

The map, along with matched genomic and transcriptomic data, revealed tissue-specific variations in methylation patterns. ""What we found is that not all organs we surveyed are equal in terms of their methylation patterns,"" Ecker said in a statement. ""The signatures of methylation are distinct enough between organs that we can look at the methylation patterns of a tissue and know whether the tissue is muscle or thymus or pancreas."" Analysis of the map also found that non-CG methylation was more common than previously thought and enabled the researchers to predict genes that might be escaping from X-chromosome inactivation. To survey the human epigenome with a particular emphasis on cytosine methylation, the researchers obtained post-mortem tissue samples from 18 different parts of the body from four individuals. In addition to performing MethylC-seq on the samples, they also conducted mRNA-seq and genome sequencing. From this, they reported that about 15 percent of the CG sites they examined were differentially methylated. According to the researchers, some 60 percent of the differentially methylated regions they uncovered were novel. Hypomethylation at these differentially methylated regions was linked with tissue-specific functions, Ecker and his colleagues said. For instance, they reported that strongly hypomethylated regions in aortic tissue overlapped with aorta-specific super-enhancers located near MYH10, a gene involved in blood vessel function. Tissues belonging to the same organ system   such as heart and muscle tissues   tended to cluster together when the researchers performed a hierarchical clustering analysis on hypomethylation at differentially methylated regions. They observed a similar clustering in their transcriptome-level data. Further, methylation at these differentially methylated regions correlated inversely with gene expression, with that correlation becoming stronger at spots close to transcription start sites. The researchers noted that the strongest negative correlation wasn't actually at the gene promoters, but at locations slightly downstream of promoters. ""In the past, people have really thought the promoter or the upstream regions are where everything is happening,"" Ecker added. ""But we found that methylation changes that are most correlated with gene transcription are often in the downstream regions of the promoter."" He and his colleagues also found that predicted enhancers and putative promoters together only accounted for about half of the intragenic differentially methylated regions. The remaining undefined intragenic differentially methylated regions (uiDMRs) could represent a previously unrecognized type of functional elements. Methylation of these uiDMRs, the researchers added, correlated strongly with the expression of the genes that contained them. In addition, Ecker and his team uncovered evidence of non-CG methylation, which had previously been found in human embryonic stem cells and a few other cell types. This mCH methylation, they further reported, could be split into two groups based upon the context of the methylation, whether it fell in a TNCAC or NNCAN motif. ""The only place this had been observed before was in the brain, skeletal muscle, germ cells, and stem cells,"" first author Matthew Schultz, a former Ecker lab graduate student now at Human Longevity, said in a statement. ""So, to see it in a variety of normal adult tissues was really exciting."" They also noted a negative correlation between expression and mCG and that, except for in brain cells, mCH levels dropped during differentiation. The methylome map also highlighted female-specific promoter mCG hypomethylation and gene body mCH hypermethylation that appeared to mark genes that escape X chromosome inactivation. Gene body mCH, they added, was particularly able to predict bi-allelically expressed genes. For instance, they found that genes like FUNDC1 exhibited female-specific hypermethylation in a number of tissues, except for in neurons, which suggested to the researchers that there could be tissue-dependent regulation of X inactivation escape. Ecker and his colleagues also argued that such methylome maps could help researchers understand the interplay between disease and epigenetics. ""You could imagine that eventually, if someone is having a problem, a biopsy might not only look at characterizing the cells or genes, but the epigenome as well,"" Ecker said.","Published: June 3, 2015"

This research, which has been published in Current Biology, paves the way for a systematic investigation of the neural computations that underlie sensory navigation in a miniature brain. The work is a new example on how systems biology allows scientists to approach complex questions such as brain functions. If a banana is rotting in the fruit basket of your kitchen, chances are that a fruit fly will find it long before you do. How is the nervous system of a tiny fly capable of ascending the odor trail created by a banana? This question has been addressed in the study which was conducted by the Sensory Systems and Behaviour laboratory led by Matthieu Louis at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-CRG Systems Biology Unit of the CRG. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system to explore how complex behaviors, such as chemotaxis, are controlled by the activity of neural circuits. Although the word neuroscience may evoke the human brain to most of us, research in smaller genetic model organisms often represents the most direct entry point into the molecular and cellular basis neural functions. The research carried out by the Louis lab is a new example on how the combination of interdisciplinary tools permits to probe basic principles underlying complex biological processes. In this case, CRG scientists dive deep into the fruit fly neural circuits, which could be the entrance to more complex systems as the human brain. To identify the neural circuits involved in chemotaxis, the team decided to concentrate on the fruit fly larva, which comprises 10,000 neurons   10 times less than adult flies and 10 million times less than humans. In temerarious efforts, the team screened over 1,100 fly strains where the function of a small subset of neurons of the brain could be genetically turned off.  At the beginning of this project, we had the feeling to be looking for a needle in a haystack. We knew about the 21 olfactory neurons in the head of the larva and the motor neurons in the equivalent of spinal cord in the larva. In contrast, we had virtually no clue about the identity of the neurons in between, the synapses responsible for the processing of the olfactory information and its conversion into navigational decisions , explains Louis. From this screen, the attention of the team was drawn onto a handful of neurons located in a region traditionally associated with reflexive taste behavior. When the function of the identified neurons was silenced, larvae became unable to make accurate decision to navigate odor gradients. Using optogenetics, a method that exploits light to control and monitor neurons, Ibrahim Tastekin, one of the co-first authors of the work, was able to activate individual neurons. To his astonishment, he found that brief excitations were sufficient to trigger a change in orientation.  This was like magic: optogenetics gave us a means to remote control an elementary form of decision making. The fly genetic toolkit creates unprecedented possibilities to probe the function of individual neurons in a semi high-throughput manner. Here we proved the necessity and sufficiency of a couple of neurons to control a fundamental aspect of chemotaxis: the conversion of sensory information into behavior.  The team went further by demonstrating that the neurons identified in this zone are involved in the processing of odor, light and temperature.  We are very excited to define how these neurons operate in concert with the rest of the circuitry in charge of chemotaxis,  says Louis.

Conventional thawing methods, including swirling vials in warm water baths or rolling vials between hands can result in variable cell viabilities and can increase contamination concerns. BioCision s ThawSTAR system utilizes a patent pending adaptive sensing technology that incorporates algorithms to deliver a consistent and reproducible thaw profile and endpoint to each vial, thus providing a standardized thawing process, eliminating variability that could have a detrimental effect on the safety and efficacy of the cell therapy, and providing a significant reduction in cell handling risk in a clinical setting. Dr. Rolf O. Ehrhardt, CEO of BioCision, said,  As more cell therapies reach late stage clinical trials and commercialization, the need to standardize and de-risk cell handling, including thawing, is becoming critical.  The ThawSTAR system has been demonstrated to significantly improve cell viability and recovery in comparison to conventional methods, and may ultimately enhance the consistency of therapeutic outcomes.  The new ThawSTAR automated cell thawing system that will be developed as a result of this collaboration is an expansion of BioCision s technology platform and will be made available commercially.  BioCision is also developing other vial formats to address the needs of the larger cell therapy market. ","Published: June 3, 2015"

The team of British scientists, funded by the Wellcome Trust, is using semi-conductor next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to generate data in a lab facilitated by Public Health England and International Medical Corps. Following two stints volunteering in a diagnostic laboratory attached to an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in one of the worst affected parts of Sierra Leone, Ian Goodfellow, Ph.D., head of Virology at the University of Cambridge, returned a third time to study the virus at a molecular level using the advanced NGS platform. Paul Kellam, Ph.D., professor of the Virus Genomics laboratory at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, leads the team focused on mapping the genomic data generated by Goodfellow and his colleagues.  Sequencing the genome of a virus can tell us a lot about how it spreads and changes as it passes from person to person. While this information is invaluable to researchers, the rapid sharing of data does not always occur,  said Kellam.  It used to take months to process samples that had to be brought back to labs in the UK for analysis. Having sequencing capabilities on the ground helps generate data in a matter of days or at the longest weeks, which should have a profound impact on how the Ebola virus is researched and inevitably addressed on a global scale.  Rapid sequencing enables epidemiologists to decipher the source of individual strains, and helps eliminate the need to rely upon Ebola patients to tell them how and where they contracted the virus, as different strains can be tracked as they are transmitted from person to person. Since the first reported case in March 2014, the Ebola outbreak has claimed nearly 11,000 lives in West African countries. In response, Thermo Fisher Scientific has developed the new Ion AmpliSeq Ebola Panel for the Ion PGM and Ion Chef gene sequencing system. The entire system was selected for its ability to perform and adapt in atypical laboratory environments, including power supply availability, levels of dust in the air and the ability to maintain the equipment in the absence of access to service engineers, Goodfellow said.  This proved to be a great opportunity to show how genome sequencing technology, typically used only in specialized laboratories, can be transported to and readily operated in more harsh environments in a real-world and real-time situation. Only by understanding the Ebola virus and other pathogens, which cause so much suffering in countries like Sierra Leone, can we take meaningful steps to protect communities from future outbreaks,  said Goodfellow.  My hope is that this technology will be used by the next generation of Sierra Leonean scientists and researchers to help provide a sustainable research and surveillance system in the future.  The next-generation sequencing system was installed at the laboratory adjacent to an Ebola Treatment Centre in Makeni, which was funded by the United Kingdom s Department for International Development and is run by Public Health England. The Ebola Treatment Centre is run by International Medical Corps. In order to ensure a lasting benefit for the project beyond the current crisis, the next-generation sequencing system is expected to be installed at the University of Makeni, where it will be used by local scientists to study Ebola, and other pathogens that affect the region.  This important and timely effort to better understand Ebola s evolution at the molecular level would not have been possible without the active participation and support from each organization involved,  said Chris Linthwaite, president, Genetic Sciences at Thermo Fisher Scientific.  The valuable sequencing data now being shared globally will be critical to help researchers stay ahead of the virus.   We ve learned many painful lessons from the Ebola outbreak, not least of which is that as a scientific community we must become less secretive with the data that is generated,"" added Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust.  The collective expertise of the world s infectious disease experts is more powerful than any single lab, and the best way of tapping into this is to enhance the capacity to generate the data in the countries affected, rather than having to fly samples out to other countries and then to make the data openly and safely available, as soon as possible. The Wellcome Trust is delighted to support this crucial work with its centre of gravity in Sierra Leone.  The Ion AmpliSeq Ebola Panel, Ion PGM System and Ion Chef are For Research Use only.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ubiquigent and the Cyclofluidic will design, develop and characterise small molecule compound libraries by combining their two leading approaches: Ubiquigent   Ubiquigent provides access to a full suite of drug discovery services and high integrity reagents and kits to help investigators unravel the complexity of, and pursue, new therapeutic target opportunities across the ubiquitin system. Ubiquigent designs HTS-ready assays and undertakes complex drug discovery services on targets such as the ubiquitin ligases (E3s), ubiquitin deconjugating enzymes (DUBs, DUBprofiler ), and other system targets to support research in this rapidly emerging field. Cyclofluidic - The CyclOps  platform integrates flow chemistry, purification, screening and drug design utilising machine learning algorithms to allow drug lead molecules to be assayed minutes, rather than weeks, after they are designed. The team has shown that use of the platform reduces timelines for hit to lead optimisation by 50%, from a year to less than 6 months, allowing molecules to progress into pre-clinical studies faster. The output of the collaboration will be a valuable source of novel targeted libraries that the companies will jointly commercialise. These libraries will provide new medicinal chemistry opportunities to support the identification of potent and selective compounds that target key members of this family of new drug targets, which have been implicated across multiple therapeutic areas including: cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic, neurological and musculoskeletal, and infection and immunity. Commenting on the collaboration, Dr. Jason Brown, Managing Director of Ubiquigent, said:  We are very pleased to be entering into this relationship with Cyclofluidic as we believe that our combined approach will uncover many exciting opportunities in this rapidly developing field. This latest collaboration further supports Ubiquigent s goal of being the first, ubiquitin system-focused, fully integrated provider of biology, assays, small molecule libraries and compound profiling services.  Dr. Dave Parry, Chief Operating Officer of Cyclofluidic, added:  We are excited by the opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of our CyclOps  platform in accelerating discovery to this rapidly evolving area of biology which has been made possible through access to Ubiquigent s leading expertise in the field.

This ability may provide new insights into the cause, penetrance, and severity of diseases.  The  phase  (or linked arrangement) of variants along a single chromosome is known as the haplotype, which is an important piece of the genetic puzzle of a disease. Haplotype cannot be determined from standard DNA sequencing, due to short read lengths.  Unlike conventional phasing methods that are tedious and expensive, Drop-Phase can be used to quickly and affordably determine the phase of multiple sequence variants in a region of interest after a sample has been sequenced. The resulting haplotype data can then be used to characterize how specific combinations of variants contribute to the severity of a disease. Drop-Phase can also be used to screen individuals for specific haplotypes when sequencing data are unavailable. This is particularly valuable for prospective clinical trials.   We expect researchers to use Drop-Phase to resolve the configuration of variants discovered from genome-wide association studies and determine whether certain haplotypes contribute to the severity of a disease,  said John Regan, leader of the Advanced Droplet Digital PCR Applications Group at the Digital Biology Center and first author of the paper.  For the first time, a technology is available that makes this work easy and affordable. This information will greatly accelerate our understanding of disease genomics, which is very exciting,  he said.  We hope Drop-Phase advances work in a variety of genetic fields, including clinical genetics, genome editing, and the analysis of allele-specific expression,  said Steven McCarroll, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, director of genetics for the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, and the paper s senior author. Traditional methods for phasing pairs of variants involve long-range PCR, cloning, and/or manual dilution to single-molecule concentrations followed by sequencing and expensive library preparation methods that may require resequencing. Day-to-day use of these molecular phasing approaches is limited by cost, time requirements, and the distance between allelic markers. In contrast, Drop-Phase allows researchers to rapidly phase hundreds of samples at a low cost and at distances greater than 200 kb in a 96-well format. Additionally, using information across multiple reaction wells makes it possible to phase across vast regions of a chromosome. The Drop-Phase method uses ddPCR technology to subdivide a DNA reaction mixture into thousands of nanoliter-sized droplets.  Our approach is based on a simple idea: when two allelic markers are physically linked they will partition into the same droplets,  the article reports. Within each droplet, the DNA is amplified in the presence of two different fluorescent reporters specific to the allelic markers of interest. If a higher percentage of droplets is positive for both markers than expected by chance, the allelic markers are determined to be on the same chromosome. For the study, the authors used cystic fibrosis to illustrate the utility of Drop-Phase. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by variations within the 189-kb CFTR gene. Individuals with one compromised CFTR gene are carriers; individuals with both CFTR genes compromised have cystic fibrosis. Knowing the chromosomal phase of CFTR variants is important for predicting the severity of the disease. Using Drop-Phase, the researchers easily determined the chromosomal phase of CFTR variant pairs by revealing whether two mutations in a sample altered only one or both copies of the CFTR gene. To conduct this study, the researchers used Bio-Rad s QX200  Droplet Digital PCR System and its included QuantaSoft  Software, which automatically calculates the number of linked copies per microliter for every duplex reaction performed. The paper also explains how QuantaSoft calculates the concentration of linked species and how to calculate the percentage of linked molecules in a sample. In addition to phasing variants, Drop-Phase can be used to validate the presence of somatic structural variants (for example, translocations) and map highly repetitive regions of the genome by estimating the genomic distance separating unique loci.

These HDx  Reference standards, being developed by Horizon Diagnostics, a division of Horizon, will support proficiency testing of CareDx s solid organ transplant injury monitoring diagnostic tests and will be integrated into CLIA laboratory testing. HDx Reference Standards offer a source of genetically defined, quantitative, sustainable and independent third party reference material, critical to the validation and routine performance monitoring of CareDx s next generation sequencing (NGS) based donor-derived cfDNA (dd-cfDNA) diagnostic assay. The reference standards mimic plasma cfDNA both in size and abundance in transplant setting and are the first commercially available standards of their kind. Horizon Diagnostics uses its proprietary genome engineering platforms to precisely engineer highly characterized parental cell lines. Horizon Diagnostics then generates mixtures at very precise allelic frequencies, verified by digital PCR, ranging between 0.1% and 50%. CareDx s cfDNA test is designed to monitor injury to transplanted organs, in particular heart and kidney in transplant recipients to allow clinicians to better manage patient health outcomes. There are approximately 300,000 solid organ transplant patients living in the US. The assay amplifies approximately 250 loci of the human genome to identify transplant donor-recipient pairs with diverse ancestral heritage as well as those with close familial relationships.  The CareDx cfDNA assay offers a simpler alternative to assays requiring donor and recipient genotyping to simplify assay implementation. CareDx s cfDNA test follows recent guidance for next generation sequencing (NGS) outlined by Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP), American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The targeted assay was recognized in the ""What's Hot, What's New"" session at the American Transplant Congress in Philadelphia on May 6, 2015. Dr. Paul Morrill, President, Products Business, Horizon, said:  This new collaboration with CareDx demonstrates the importance of well validated controls when developing clinical assays, especially as technologies such as NGS become more widely adopted for diagnostic use. Horizon is committed and motivated to be working with CareDx on the development of cell-free DNA reference standards within the solid organ transplant field, taking our reference standard technology into a new area beyond Oncology."" Dr. John J. Sninsky, CSO of CareDx, commented:  I have been working with Horizon s scientists for more than five years, and am continually impressed by their understanding of diagnostic requirements. At CareDx, it is our goal to accelerate patient access to clinical data using next generation sequencing technology. This collaboration with Horizon has the potential to advance us to this goal, and demonstrates CareDx s continued quality and regulatory leadership. ","Published: June 3, 2015"

Furthermore, they found that D4A is more effective than abiraterone at killing aggressive prostate cancer cells, suggesting that some patients may benefit from direct treatment with D4A. Prostate cancer cells are fueled by androgens (male hormones). When prostate cancer spreads, androgen deprivation therapy (""medical castration"") is used to cut off the tumor's energy supply. However, aggressive, metastatic tumors can become resistant to this type of therapy. In a landmark 2013 publication in Cell, Dr. Sharifi described a genetic mutation that enables prostate cancer cells to produce their own hormones for fuel, making them resistant to traditional hormone deprivation therapies. Abiraterone works by blocking CYP17A1, an enzyme that is crucial for the production of androgens. Dr. Sharifi's team found that the more active D4A inhibits two additional enzymes responsible for producing androgens, as well as blocks the androgen receptor, which renders existing androgens inactive. They found that 12 patients on active abiraterone therapy had detectable serum levels of D4A. D4A levels varied among patients, however, suggesting that individuals may differ in their metabolism of abiraterone to D4A. ""More studies are needed to uncover the exact mechanisms involved, but we predict that direct treatment with D4A could prolong survival in some patients with metastatic prostate cancer,"" said Dr. Sharifi, ""Further studies will also help us develop a potential biomarker profile to predict which patients will respond to D4 - abiraterone."" Dr. Sharifi holds positions in Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute, Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute, and Taussig Cancer Institute, and is the Kendrick Family Endowed Chair for Prostate Cancer Research. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with nearly 240,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United State. According to the American Cancer Society, there will be an estimated 30,000 deaths due to prostate cancer in 2013.

The new finding has potential implications for the development of immunity-based therapies to treat tuberculosis, which typically takes months to eradicate and has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics. An enzyme that acts as a sensor in the immune system - cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) - is essential for defense against the tuberculosis bacteria, the study showed. When infected with TB, mice lacking this enzyme succumbed much quicker than mice with normal cGAS activity.  Based on this outcome, we believe that modulating cGAS activity could be a novel approach to therapy. There remains a dire need for new therapies against tuberculosis, and thus identifying pathways to stop the pathogen is of vital importance,  said Dr. Michael Shiloh, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Microbiology at UT Southwestern, and co-senior author of the study published in Cell Host & Microbe. TB is a bacterial infection with widespread global reach. About one-third of the world s population is infected with the bacterium, though most infected people have no symptoms and may not know they have it. Tuberculosis is the No. 1 cause of bacteria-related death and also the leading cause of death for people infected with HIV. TB is spread by airborne personal contact with an infected individual. While TB is prevalent in underdeveloped countries, about 12,000 to 15,000 new cases arise in the U.S. annually, mainly in people who are immigrants from counties where TB is more endemic. Working with Dr. Shiloh on the study as co-senior author was Dr. Zhijian  James  Chen, Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator, and Professor of Molecular Biology and with the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense. Dr. Chen discovered the cGAS enzyme in 2012 and how it orchestrates immune responses to DNA.  The finding that the cGAS pathway is important for sensing and defending against TB infection suggests that this pathway may be harnessed to develop better vaccines and therapeutics to protect people from this dreaded disease,  said Dr. Chen, who holds the George L. MacGregor Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science. The study showed that when tuberculosis is detected by cGAS, a compound called cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is produced. cGAMP then initiates a cell signaling cascade that triggers production of interferons and cytokines and activation of autophagy, an important host-defense mechanism. Thus, cGAMP could possibly be leveraged as a biomarker for active disease and therapy response, and could be used as an adjuvant for developing an effective TB vaccine or therapy. This work and two similar studies also reported in Cell Host & Microbe point to cGAS as having strong potential for immunity-based therapeutics to combat TB, and potentially other infectious diseases. With TB in particular, new treatments are desperately needed.  Tuberculosis is already a significant global pandemic and the threat of multidrug resistance is high. If drug-resistant TB were to spread more internationally, then TB could become a real public health disaster,  Dr. Shiloh said.","Published: June 3, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/building-a-better-microscope-189435,Building a Better Microscope  Technological refinements have allowed cryo EM to become a key tool in structural biology  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. One of the more famous images in biology is known as ""Photo 51,"" an image of DNA that chemist Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling created in 1952 by shooting X-rays through fibers of DNA and analyzing the patterns they left behind on film. That image provided Nobel Prize winners James Watson and Francis Crick with crucial information they needed to determine the 3D structure of DNA   knowledge that ultimately gave rise to molecular biology. For much of the 20th century, this method of analyzing X-ray diffraction patterns has been the standard for determining the 3D structures of proteins, generally using a technique known as X-ray crystallography. But this method relies on getting proteins to pack tightly together to form uniform crystals, which is notoriously difficult, especially when it comes to the floppy, dynamic proteins that live in cell membranes. Yet biologists are particularly interested in these membrane proteins because the membrane is the cell s dock, its security checkpoint, its mailbox. From sugars to viral invaders to nerve impulses, all cellular traffic passes through the cell membrane, and likely interacts with the proteins embedded there, such as neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. To understand all that transpires at the membrane, biologists need to zoom in to the atomic level. The proteins  resistance to crystallization, therefore, left scientists in a bind. Now, after decades of challenges, scientists have developed an imaging technique that allows them to visualize these tiny membrane proteins thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair   and to do so without first having to form crystals. Known as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, the technique had largely been written off as useless for determining the structure of very small proteins. But technological refinements made over the past several years at UC San Francisco and other institutions have made cryo-EM a key tool in structural biology. Cryo-EM has made this marked jump in the last three or four years in terms of resolution, so that we can go from just seeing the general outline of a protein, what people used to refer to as  blob-ology,  and now see, actually, the atomic structure,  said David Julius, Ph.D., professor and chair of UCSF s Department of Physiology. Julius collaborated with Yifan Cheng, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics, to use cryo-EM to visualize the structure of the body s receptors that sense the spiciness of chilli peppers.  These receptors are also involved in how the body signals pain   and the findings are already being used to test new pain drugs that bind to these receptors.  By being able to really determine a molecule s atomic structure, you can understand how it works in detail, you can make connections between the biology and chemistry, and it also provides capability for drug discovery and design,  said David Agard, Ph.D., professor of biophysics and biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator, who worked with Cheng to create better cameras and software for cryo-EM.  So it s really a huge change in what s possible.  Yet for a long time, scientists didn t believe electron microscopy would be useful for imaging proteins and other biological samples at all. The problem was that electron microscopes work by shooting electrons at the speed of light through a biological sample suspended in a vacuum; this process often destroyed the raw biological samples researchers were trying to see.   Then in the 1970s and 1980s, researchers at Heidelberg s European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory developed a way to protect samples and also keep them in a dissolved state similar to how they live in the cell: they rapidly freeze the purified biological samples in a very thin layer of liquid. Yet even when frozen at around -300  F, the tiny proteins still moved when hit by the powerful stream of electrons. So scientists turned to using very low electron doses   analogous to taking a photo in very low light   which minimizes the damage but leaves the image grainy. To reduce this blur, the team developed a new camera that records a movie of the wiggling sample under the microscope. At 400 frames per second, the recording provides enough data so the motion correction software developed in Cheng s laboratory can correct for the molecular motion and effectively  unblur  the image. Another challenge was that earlier digital cameras used in cryo-EM detected light, not electrons. So when the electron passed through the sample the signal had to be translated into light signals, and resolution was lost in the process.  This combination of the bad detector, blurring from the motion and radiation damage, where the sample was being destroyed by the electrons, made it all a very difficult process,  said Agard. To circumvent the problem of translating electrons into light, Cheng and Agard brought together a team and developed a camera that detects electrons directly. The researchers collaborated with the electron microscopy company Gatan and scientists at Lawrence Berkeley to build a new detector called the K2 Summit, named after one of the most challenging mountain ascents in the world. In 2013, Cheng and Julius reported that they had used this new camera to achieve near-atomic-level structure of the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, which detects the heat of chili peppers. Cryo-EM had previously been used to examine larger structures, like ribosomes and viruses, but this was the first membrane protein to which the technique had been applied.  A small thing like a TRP channel, that was a real revelation,  said Nikolaus Grigorieff, who does cryo-EM research at HHMI s Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia.   Earlier this year, Cheng and Julius determined the structure of another key protein receptor, TRPA1, involved in how the body signals pain. There will be many revelations to come.  The future s very exciting, for sure,  said Cheng.  This opens up tremendous opportunities for the field to tackle many challenging problems in structural biology.  The resolution of cryo-EM as used by Cheng and Agard is currently about 3  ngstr ms; for reference, an  ngstr m is about one-millionth the width of a strand of hair. Cheng and Agard would like to take it down to 2  ngstr ms, which would allow them to see not just membrane proteins but also the way that molecules, such as new therapeutics, might bind to them. Cheng plans to use cryo-EM to examine the same molecule that Watson, Crick, and Franklin probed over 60 years ago   DNA   and, more specifically, chromatin, the term for DNA in complex with its associated proteins. ""These are extremely difficult targets for X-ray crystallography, and I anticipate that cryo-EM will also play a significant role in this area.""","Published: June 3, 2015"

One of the key themes explored by BIOTECHNICA and LABVOLUTION in Hannover is the trend towards biologization and digitalization. Industry 4.0, networking, the whole world going mobile   digitalization is a megatrend of our age, familiar to all and directly affecting each one of us. But there are other key trends at work too, even if they are rather overshadowed by digitalization. One of these megatrends is so-called biologization.  Biologization, or the application of biotechnology to existing processes in a whole range of industry sectors, is already an important driver of innovation , says Dr. Jochen K ckler, member of the Managing Board at Deutsche Messe.  BIOTECHNICA 2015 shows how far we have come down this road.  This view is confirmed by Dr. Peter Heinrich, Board chairman of BIO Deutschland:  There are very few problems today in areas such as food, health, the environment, climate change and energy where biotechnology cannot be a big part of the solution. In chemicals, pharmaceuticals, energy and materials, the biologization of traditional industries has become an unstoppable trend, and biotech companies have a special role to play here.  Dr. Siegfried Bialojan, Managing Director of the EY Life Science Center in Mannheim and a member of the advisory board for BIOTECHNICA and LABVOLUTION, cites some specific examples:  Whether it s new textiles made from spider silk protein, flue gases turned into biomass for the production of plastics, or foodstuffs manufactured with the aid of certain types of yeast   the chemical and consumer goods industries have already embraced biologization with enthusiasm.  Meanwhile the structurally similar trend towards digitalization and networking will also be much in evidence in Hannover. K ckler:  We re looking forward to a world first in October: for the first time visitors to LABVOLUTION will be able to see a model  Laboratory 4.0  in action, fully wired and networked for the virtual future.  BIOTECHNICA   now with new PLAZA format and new  Bio-IT  marketplace Digitalization is also a major theme at BIOTECHNICA this year. The new marketplace  Bio-IT  takes its place alongside the existing marketplaces  Bioeconomy  and  Personalized Medicine Technologies , adding another important strand to the show s coverage. The displays here examine both the role of IT in biotechnology and the use of bio-engineering in the IT industry. Also new for this year is the BIOTECHNICA PLAZA, which serves as a central connecting hub for the three marketplaces. As the starting point for exploring these three featured themes, together with their associated Forum program hosted on two stages, and also as a meeting place for networking and partnering, the BIOTECHNICA PLAZA is very much the heart of the show. For the first time Deutsche Messe is offering a professional partnering service for exhibitors and visitors attending BIOTECHNICA and LABVOLUTION. There is no charge for using the service, which is powered by a special software tool developed by the EBD Group. This allows users to create their own online profile and schedule meetings at the show in advance. Meanwhile BIOTECHNICA retains all its traditional strengths as Europe s premier industry gathering for biotechnology and the life sciences. For 30 years now industry and the scientific community have used BIOTECHNICA to find products, technologies and partners for joint ventures. BIOTECHNICA is the only trade show of its kind to cover the complete value-adding chain for red, white and green biotechnology   from basic scientific research to the finished product. LABVOLUTION   with smartLAB and European Lab Automation By contrast, LABVOLUTION has no established track record as yet. It was less than a year ago, after all, that Deutsche Messe announced the creation of a new trade show with the aim of showcasing the complete range of laboratory equipment and technology for research labs, analytical labs, production labs and training labs. One of the highlights of this premiere will be the already mentioned special display smartLAB. This is a project in which a study group made up of scientists and business enterprises set out to design and develop an intelligent model laboratory. The result is smartLAB, which will be revealed to the public for the first time at LABVOLUTION. Live demonstrations of various application scenarios will show how laboratory life is changing in the age of digitalization. Running in parallel on the 400 m2 dedicated display area will be a forum program exploring various aspects of  Laboratory 4.0 . LABVOLUTION is also hosting this year s European Lab Automation (ELA), Europe s largest conference and exhibition on automation in the life sciences, last staged in Hamburg and Barcelona. The ELA exhibition will be integrated into LABVOLUTION, while the conference program   for which a separate ticket must be purchased   takes place in the adjacent Convention Center. The three strands of the ELA conference explore the themes Lab Automation and Robotics, Genome Engineering and Personalized Medicine. In a departure from tradition, the formal opening event is not taking place on the eve of the show, but rather in the evening at the end of the first full day. One of the highlights of the BIOTECHNICA/LABVOLUTION Reception will be the presentation of the EUROPEAN BIOTECHNICA AWARD.","Published: June 3, 2015"

The trial seeks to determine whether targeted therapies for people whose tumors have specific gene mutations will be effective regardless of their cancer type. NCI-MATCH will incorporate more than 20 different study drugs or drug combinations, each targeting a specific gene mutation, in order to match each patient in the trial with a therapy that targets a molecular abnormality in their tumor.  NCI-MATCH is a phase II trial with numerous small substudies (arms) for each treatment being investigated. It will open with approximately 10 substudies, moving to 20 or more within months. The study parameters for the first 10 arms are being sent to 2,400 participating sites in the NCTN for review in preparation for patient enrollment beginning in July. The exact date for the opening of patient enrollment will be decided shortly after the ASCO meeting. Additional substudies are in development and will be added over time as the trial progresses.  The NCI-MATCH trial has two enrollment steps. Each patient will initially enroll for screening in which samples of their tumor will be removed (biopsied). The samples will undergo DNA sequencing to detect genetic abnormalities that may be driving tumor growth and might be targeted by one of a wide range of drugs being studied. If a molecular abnormality is detected for which there is a specific substudy available, to be accepted in NCI-MATCH patients will be further evaluated to determine if they meet the specific eligibility requirements within that arm. Once enrolled, patients will be treated with the targeted drug regimen for as long as their tumor shrinks or remains stable. Overall, trial investigators plan to screen about 3,000 patients during the full course of the NCI-MATCH trial to enroll about 1,000 patients in the various treatment arms. Adults 18 years of age and older with solid tumors or lymphomas that have advanced following at least one line of standard systemic therapy, or with tumors for which there is no standard treatment, will be eligible. Each arm of the trial will enroll up to 35 patients. The trial's design calls for at least a quarter of the 1,000-patients enrolled to involve people with rare types of cancer.   ""NCI-MATCH is a unique, ground-breaking trial,"" said Doug Lowy, M.D., NCI acting director. ""It is the first study in oncology that incorporates all of the tenets of precision medicine. There are no other cancer clinical trials of this size and scope that truly bring the promise of targeted treatment to patients whose cancers have specific genetic abnormalities. It holds the potential to transform cancer care."" Since many gene mutations in tumors are infrequent or unique, screening for individual mutations is not cost-effective or efficient in clinical trials. Instead, NCI-MATCH will use advanced gene sequencing techniques to screen for many molecular abnormalities at once. Large numbers of patient tumors will need to be screened because most gene mutations occur in 10 percent or less of cancer patients. Most patients are expected to have one, or at most two, treatable mutations in their tumors. By having multiple treatments available for these genetic abnormalities in a single clinical trial, several different study drugs or drug combinations can be evaluated simultaneously. ""In addition to exploring very fundamental aspects of cancer biology and therapy, this trial will bring cutting-edge molecular analysis and a large portfolio of targeted therapy treatment regimens to patients being treated at oncology practices large and small,"" said ECOG-ACRIN study chair, Keith T. Flaherty, M.D., a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor, Harvard Medical School, both in Boston. NCI-MATCH will use a single DNA sequencing test to identify gene mutations in patients' tumors. The NCI Molecular Characterization Laboratory at the NCI Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research in Frederick, Maryland, has developed the test which looks for 143 genes associated with cancer that can be targeted by drugs in the trial. To ensure quality control, biopsy specimens from all 3,000 screened patients will be sent to a single location for processing: the ECOG-ACRIN Central Biorepository and Pathology Facility at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The DNA sequencing analysis will be done at one of four facilities using a standardized process.   ""The use of a unique kit for specimen collection, shipment, and centralized tissue processing, assures high-quality analysis,"" said ECOG-ACRIN laboratory lead, Stanley R. Hamilton, M.D., head of pathology and laboratory medicine at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. ""The network of four molecular diagnostics labs provides capacity for large numbers of patients to be screened in the trial. Pilot testing of specimens across the four locations showed remarkable reproducibility of the molecular results-another important aspect of quality assurance in trials of this scope and scale."" The cancer treatment drugs being used in NCI-MATCH include both U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs as well as investigational agents that are being contributed by a number of pharmaceutical companies. Most of the arms in the trial will incorporate single-agent drugs that are either commercially available or are still being tested in clinical trials. However, a few arms will contain combinations of drugs for which there are enough safety data and evidence that they might be active against a particular genetic abnormality.  Since NCI-MATCH is designed to explore whether drugs are effective against specific molecular abnormalities, patients who have tumors that can be treated with a drug already approved by the FDA for their molecular abnormality will not be eligible to use the same drug in NCI-MATCH. They could be considered for other drugs within NCI-MATCH if they have already received an approved therapy and have a different genetic abnormality that could be targeted with a new drug. There are two main clinical endpoints in the NCI-MATCH trial. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate, which is the proportion of patients in the trial whose tumors shrink by a predefined amount over a specific time period. The secondary endpoint is 6-month progression-free survival, which is a measure of whether a patient's disease remains stable.  ""For our purposes, a response rate of 5 percent or less in a molecularly-defined population will not be considered promising, whereas a response rate of 16 percent to 25 percent will be encouraging,"" said NCI study co-chair Barbara A. Conley, M.D., associate director of the NCI's Cancer Diagnosis Program. ""After starting treatment in NCI-MATCH, a 6-month progression-free survival of 15 percent will not be considered promising, whereas a progression-free survival at six months of 35 percent will indicate that we would want to develop that treatment further."" Enrollment in NCI-MATCH will be available across the country through NCTN sites. In addition, the trial will be available through sites nationwide that participate in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. All of the approximately 2,400 sites that participate in the trial will use the NCI Central Institutional Review Board as the institutional review board of record. Sites will access the trial under the protocol identification EAY131 via the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit. ","Published: June 3, 2015"

The qualitative qPCR-based test expands the gastrointestinal Amplidiag test menu and is immediately available throughout Europe. The first-to-market, non-invasive molecular diagnostic test reliably detects the gastric pathogen H. pylori as well as one of its key resistances to clarithromycin. The test is performed directly from stool DNA extract in a rapid manner. Amplidiag H. pylori+ClariR is aimed at primary testing in cases where H. pylori infection is suspected. Through the unique ability to detect a key antibiotic resistance in conjunction with the pathogen, the test enables the targeting of primary eradication therapy without inconvenient invasive procedures and unnecessary waiting. In the longer term, the test is expected to contribute to the fight against gastric cancers, a global killer consistently associated with H. pylori infection. The test performance was evaluated with nearly 300 clinical samples and was compared to two commonly used stool antigen tests. All positive findings were further sequenced to verify the result and the correct identification of the clarithromycin resistance gene mutations. The established sensitivity and specificity for H. pylori identification were 93.1% and 99.2%, respectively, while both figures were 100% for clarithromycin resistance mutation detection. Out of the nearly 300 samples, Amplidiag H. pylori+ClariR identified 54 true positive samples, of which 12 were found to have a clarithromycin resistance mutation. Helicobacter pylori a common gastric pathogen associated with gastric cancerH. pylori is a gastric pathogen which has been estimated to colonize half the world s population, and may cause dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. According to a recent report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization, there are about one million new cases of gastric cancer and over 700,000 related deaths each year. The report also recommends population-wide screening of H. pylori to prevent gastric cancer. The current primary diagnostic tests include stool antigen tests, urea breath tests and serological tests. These methods, while popular and well established, are incapable of detecting antibiotic resistances. Especially in cases of therapy failure, secondary diagnostics relies on gastric biopsy and subsequent pathogen culturing and antibiotic susceptibility testing - an invasive methodology which is time consuming, inconvenient and expensive. Clarithromycin is a key part of first-line eradication therapy, and resistance to clarithromycin is the leading cause of therapy failures. According to the Maastricht IV/ Florence Consensus Report, the success rate of the eradication therapy is only 10-30% in the case of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori; and in cases of first-line treatment failure, the chance of having a clarithromycin-resistant strain is 60-70%. Further, the report states that there is strong evidence that eradication reduces the risk of developing gastric cancer.  We are very excited in bringing this novel non-invasive test to the market and believe it will be a major contribution in diagnostic and treatment processes for this common pathogen , says Tuomas Tenkanen, CEO of Mobidiag.  It should guide antibiotics selection in primary eradication therapy, result in increased therapy success rates, and thereby reduce the number of gastric biopsies in low-risk patients. Through systematic use, the test can help reduce the overall healthcare costs related to the diagnostics, treatment and complications of H. pylori infection. ","Published: June 3, 2015"

The research was led by Blaine Pfeifer, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering in the University at Buffalo School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. His team included first author Guojian Zhang, Yi Li and Lei Fang, all in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. For more than a decade, Pfeifer has been studying how to engineer E. coli to generate new varieties of erythromycin, a popular antibiotic. In the new study, he and colleagues report that they have done this successfully, harnessing E. coli to synthesize dozens of new forms of the drug that have a slightly different structure from existing versions. Three of these new varieties of erythromycin successfully killed bacteria of the species Bacillus subtilis that were resistant to the original form of erythromycin used clinically.  We re focused on trying to come up with new antibiotics that can overcome antibiotic resistance, and we see this as an important step forward,  said Pfeifer.  We have not only created new analogs of erythromycin, but also developed a platform for using E. coli to produce the drug,  he said.  This opens the door for additional engineering possibilities in the future; it could lead to even more new forms of the drug.  The study is especially important with antibiotic resistance on the rise. Erythromycin is used to treat a variety of illnesses, from pneumonia and whooping cough to skin and urinary tract infections. Getting E. coli to produce new antibiotics has been something of a holy grail for researchers in the field. That s because E. coli grows rapidly, which speeds experimental steps and aids efforts to develop and scale up production of drugs. The species also accepts new genes relatively easily, making it a prime candidate for engineering. While news reports often focus on the dangers of E. coli, most types of this bacteria are actually harmless, including those used by Pfeifer s team in the lab. Over the past 11 years, Pfeifer s research has focused on manipulating E. coli so that the organism produces all of the materials necessary for creating erythromycin. You can think of this like stocking a factory with all the necessary parts and equipment for building a car or a plane. With that phase of the research complete, Pfeifer has turned to the next goal: tweaking the way his engineered E. coli produce erythromycin so that the drug they make is slightly different than versions used in hospitals today. The process of creating erythromycin begins with three basic building blocks called metabolic precursors   chemical compounds that are combined and manipulated through an assembly line-like process to form the final product, erythromycin. To build new varieties of erythromycin with a slightly different shape, scientists can theoretically target any part of this assembly line, using various techniques to affix parts with structures that deviate slightly from the originals. On an assembly line for cars, this would be akin to screwing on a door handle with a slightly different shape. In the new study, Pfeifer s team focused on a step in the building process that had previously received little attention from researchers, a step near the end. The researchers focused on using enzymes to attach 16 different shapes of sugar molecules to a molecule called 6-deoxyerythronolide B. Every one of these sugar molecules was successfully adhered, leading, at the end of the assembly line, to more than 40 new analogs of erythromycin   three of which showed an ability to fight erythromycin-resistant bacteria in lab experiments.  The system we ve created is surprisingly flexible, and that s one of the great things about it,  Pfeifer said.  We have established a platform for using E. coli to produce erythromycin, and now that we ve got it, we can start altering it in new ways. ","Published: June 3, 2015"

The breakthrough discovery of bacterial  chemical harpoons , made with the help of Diamond Light Source, could pave the way for a new approach to treating bacterial infections by  disarming  bacteria instead of trying to kill them with antibiotics. These chemical harpoons can be compared to a superglue, whereas all previously known bacterial binding mechanisms can be likened to weak adhesives that require large contact areas for strong binding. New research led by the University of St Andrews and the John Innes Centre  reveals how Streptococcus pyogenes, the cause of many infections ranging from the common strep throat to life-threatening  flesh-eating disease , use chemical harpoons to attach themselves to the body. Importantly, this tactic is shared by many other bacteria that infect humans, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of pneumonia in adults, and Clostridium difficile, notorious for causing severe gut infections in hospitalised patients. The study was led by Dr Uli Schwarz-Linek, structural biologist of the Biomedical Sciences Research Complex at St Andrews, and Dr Mark Banfield, John Innes Centre in Norwich, in collaboration with Prof. Manfred Rohde (Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany).  Among the weaponry of bacteria are protein molecules within hair-like structures displayed on their surfaces,  said Dr Uli Schwarz-Linek.  These serve the important purpose of allowing bacteria to cling to host tissues, such as the cells lining the lung or the gut. We have discovered how bacteria use surface proteins to achieve this important step in infections using a surprising and particularly efficient method.  I believe these findings may significantly change our view of how bacteria colonise their hosts. Our discoveries open an avenue for the development of molecules that can deactivate the chemical harpoons and therefore prevent bacteria from gaining a foothold in the body. This is of great interest since it concerns a topic of the highest possible relevance for our society - the fight against bacterial infections.  Dr Mark Banfield from the John Innes Centre, who co-led the study, said:  It has been very exciting to build on our initial discovery of the unusual bond these bacteria make with their host and to now appreciate how that bond works   all enabled through international collaborative research. Further, using the powerful X-rays available at Diamond, we were able to visualise this bacteria/host interaction at the atomic level.  Dr Des Walsh, Head of Infections and Immunity at the Medical Research Council, said:  Before we can develop new ways of fighting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we need to fully understand how bacteria survive. It is exciting that MRC-funded researchers have discovered a unique insight into how bacteria invade and seize healthy tissue. We recently awarded an additional  5m towards AMR research, and we will continue to support the best, collaborative research that explores new and promising ways to solve the challenge.

The data are from a phase 1/2a study in 42 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. MOR202 is a fully human monoclonal HuCAL antibody targeting CD38, a highly expressed and validated target in multiple myeloma. The preliminary clinical data, which were presented at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO), show that MOR202 was safe and well tolerated with a best-in-class infusion tolerability as a 2-hour infusion. Infusion reactions in patients receiving MOR202 without dexamethasone were mostly mild to moderate and mainly limited to the first infusion. In patients receiving MOR202 in combination with dexamethasone, no infusion reactions were observed. MOR202 demonstrated promising early signs of activity, and cases of long-lasting tumor control were already observed in early cohorts. The ongoing phase 1/2a, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study is being conducted in several centers in Germany and Austria. The study is evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of MOR202 as monotherapy and in combination with pomalidomide and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The primary endpoints of the trial are the safety, tolerability and recommended dose of MOR202 alone and in combination with immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Secondary outcome measures are pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy based on overall response rate, duration of response, time-to-progression, and progression-free survival. The data presented at the ASCO 2015 meeting show that MOR202 was safe and tolerable and could be administered as a 2-hour infusion. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 13 patients (37%) receiving MOR202 without dexamethasone, mainly limited to the first infusion. All infusion reactions were grade 1-2 except for one patient with grade 3. No infusion reactions occurred in patients who received dexamethasone. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been reached. The best response to date, a very good partial response (VGPR), was achieved in the 4.0 mg/kg weekly dose cohort plus dexamethasone. Additionally, one minimal response (MR) and ten cases of stable disease (SD) in other dose groups starting as low as 1.5 mg/kg biweekly were reported. The preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicate the potential for full target occupancy with a dose of 16 mg/kg administered weekly. The study is ongoing and the higher doses of MOR202 are being evaluated in combination with dexamethasone. Further cohorts in which patients will receive MOR202 up to 16 mg/kg weekly in combination with the IMiDs pomalidomide and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone will commence shortly. ""MOR202 has shown clinical activity, which is already very promising. The safety and tolerability profile, especially regarding infusion reactions, opens up the clear potential to differentiate our compound from other anti-CD38 therapies currently in development,"" commented Dr. Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys AG. ""We are pleased with this first snapshot of MOR202's clinical potential. The data will mature over the coming months and we will provide updates at future medical conferences."" MorphoSys additionally presented promising preclinical data demonstrating the synergistic potential of MOR202 and pomalidomide, an established immunomodulatory agent in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma therapy. This synergistic benefit was between 1.2-fold and 3.1-fold above the theoretical benefit of combining the drugs and resulted from multiple mechanisms, namely direct cytotoxicity, CD38 up-regulation and activation of effector cells. Dr. Schottelius added: ""We believe MOR202 is a very attractive combination partner in multiple myeloma. The data presented today support the rationale of combining MOR202 with established multiple myeloma drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide in cohorts which will commence shortly in the ongoing study.""","Published: June 3, 2015"

Astrocytes, a class of non-neuronal cells, have previously been implicated in depression and suicide. However, it was not known whether these cells were affected throughout the brain or only in certain regions. This research provides evidence that networks of astrocytes are altered specifically in areas of the brain associated with mood regulation. In addition, in describing the existence of new subtypes of astrocyte, this study reveals features specific to the human brain. The diversity and functional and morphological complexity of cortical astrocytes in humans, as well as their involvement in normal and pathological brain function, have only recently begun to be recognized. In particular, accumulating data generated by the MGSS and other independent research groups have indicated an abnormal regulation of astrocytic genes in the prefrontal cortex of patients who died while suffering from depression. This work, carried out by MGSS doctoral candidates Susana Gabriela Torres-Platas and Corina Nagy, breaks new ground. Based on the analysis of postmortem brain samples from the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank, it demonstrates that the expression of the astrocyte-specific marker GFAP, which is significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex of depressed suicides compared to that of healthy controls, is normal in other cortical areas that are not traditionally associated with depression, such as the visual cortex. However, GFAP expression was also found to be decreased in subcortical brain regions that are interconnected to the prefrontal cortex or that were previously implicated in mood disorders.  Within these subcortical regions, in samples from both patients and healthy individuals, we also observed astrocytes that were larger and more complex than those seen in cortical areas. We are currently analyzing these cells to better understand their unique properties in the human brain. I am convinced that it is important to describe how the human brain is organized at the microscopic level, and how this organization is altered in depression, in order to better understand the biological causes of this illness. This should help develop new therapeutical targets,  explains Dr. Mechawar. This study appears in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. Douglas Mental Health University Institute   press release S.G.

BMAA is a naturally-occurring amino acid with a possible link to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is the first screening study to measure BMAA in commercial seafood from metropolitan markets.  We detected BMAA in blue mussel, oyster, shrimp, plaice, char and herring but not in salmon, cod, perch and crayfish,  says Liying Jiang, PhD student at the Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry (ACES), Stockholm University. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 amino acids commonly used in making proteins but BMAA is not one of them. It is not clear how BMAA should be able to lead to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. It has been discussed that BMAA may be mistakenly incorporated into proteins during synthesis and, in turn, goes on to change their normal shape and function leading to the onset or the speeding up the progress of neurodegenerative diseases. The amino acid BMAA was first isolated and identified in extracts from the seeds of cycad trees in the West Pacific island of Guam in 1967. BMAA was potentially linked to the neurodegenerative diseases that were prevalent in Guam during the 1950 s, as an important environmental risk factor.  The BMAA producers in nature were reported to be phytoplankton, found at the bottom of the food chain. In this scenario, the entry of BMAA into the food web is inevitable.  says Liying Jiang, PhD student at the Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry (ACES), Stockholm University. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the average consumption of seafood per capita in Sweden during 2005 2007 was estimated at 28.7 kg/year, i.e. 0.6 kg/week. Liying Jiang points out that consumers can rest assured knowing that the levels of BMAA she and her colleagues measured in commercial seafood are too low to have any direct toxic effects on animals and let alone in humans. However, Liying Jiang emphasizes that we should exercise caution due to the limited data available on the distribution and function of BMAA.  It has been suggested that BMAA may be a slow toxin, possibly with a biomagnification potential, meaning that its levels could rise the higher up in the food chain it is found. Consequently it is important to monitor its distribution in our environment and understand the means by which it gets stored and released by organisms. These are necessary aspects that need to be addressed,  says Liying Jiang, PhD student at the Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry (ACES), Stockholm University.

That such vessels could have escaped detection when the lymphatic system has been so thoroughly mapped throughout the body is surprising on its own, but the true significance of the discovery lies in the effects it could have on the study and treatment of neurological diseases ranging from autism to Alzheimer's disease to multiple sclerosis. ""Instead of asking, 'How do we study the immune response of the brain?' 'Why do multiple sclerosis patients have the immune attacks?' now we can approach this mechanistically. Because the brain is like every other tissue connected to the peripheral immune system through meningeal lymphatic vessels,"" said Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, professor in the UVA Department of Neuroscience and director of UVA's Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG). ""It changes entirely the way we perceive the neuro-immune interaction. We always perceived it before as something esoteric that can't be studied. But now we can ask mechanistic questions."" ""We believe that for every neurological disease that has an immune component to it, these vessels may play a major role,"" Kipnis said. ""Hard to imagine that these vessels would not be involved in a [neurological] disease with an immune component."" Kevin Lee, PhD, chairman of the UVA Department of Neuroscience, described his reaction to the discovery by Kipnis' lab: ""The first time these guys showed me the basic result, I just said one sentence: 'They'll have to change the textbooks.' There has never been a lymphatic system for the central nervous system, and it was very clear from that first singular observation - and they've done many studies since then to bolster the finding - that it will fundamentally change the way people look at the central nervous system's relationship with the immune system."" Even Kipnis was skeptical initially. ""I really did not believe there are structures in the body that we are not aware of. I thought the body was mapped,"" he said. ""I thought that these discoveries ended somewhere around the middle of the last century. But apparently they have not."" The discovery was made possible by the work of Antoine Louveau, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Kipnis' lab. The vessels were detected after Louveau developed a method to mount a mouse's meninges - the membranes covering the brain - on a single slide so that they could be examined as a whole. ""It was fairly easy, actually,"" he said. ""There was one trick: We fixed the meninges within the skullcap, so that the tissue is secured in its physiological condition, and then we dissected it. If we had done it the other way around, it wouldn't have worked."" After noticing vessel-like patterns in the distribution of immune cells on his slides, he tested for lymphatic vessels and there they were. The impossible existed. The soft-spoken Louveau recalled the moment: ""I called Jony [Kipnis] to the microscope and I said, 'I think we have something.'"" As to how the brain's lymphatic vessels managed to escape notice all this time, Kipnis described them as ""very well hidden"" and noted that they follow a major blood vessel down into the sinuses, an area difficult to image. ""It's so close to the blood vessel, you just miss it,"" he said. ""If you don't know what you're after, you just miss it."" ""Live imaging of these vessels was crucial to demonstrate their function, and it would not be possible without collaboration with Tajie Harris,"" Kipnis noted. Harris, a PhD, is an assistant professor of neuroscience and a member of the BIG center. Kipnis also saluted the ""phenomenal"" surgical skills of Igor Smirnov, a research associate in the Kipnis lab whose work was critical to the imaging success of the study. The unexpected presence of the lymphatic vessels raises a tremendous number of questions that now need answers, both about the workings of the brain and the diseases that plague it. For example, take Alzheimer's disease. ""In Alzheimer's, there are accumulations of big protein chunks in the brain,"" Kipnis said. ""We think they may be accumulating in the brain because they're not being efficiently removed by these vessels."" He noted that the vessels look different with age, so the role they play in aging is another avenue to explore. And there's an enormous array of other neurological diseases, from autism to multiple sclerosis, that must be reconsidered in light of the presence of something science insisted did not exist.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/quick-laugh-or-smile-it-may-be-your-genes-283297,Quick to laugh or smile  It may be in your genes Researchers say common genetic variant may be associated with positive expressions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers say common genetic variant may be associated with positive expressions Why do some people immediately burst into laughter after a humorous moment, while others can barely crack a smile? New research examining emotional reactivity suggests one of the answers may lie in a person's DNA. In a new study linking a gene to positive emotional expressions such as smiling and laughing, researchers demonstrated that people with a certain genetic variant -- those with short alleles of the gene 5-HTTLPR -- smiled or laughed more while watching cartoons or subtly amusing film clips than people with long alleles. Previous research has linked the gene to negative emotions; the study provides the strongest evidence to date that the same gene is also linked to positive emotional expressions. The research is published in the American Psychological Association journal Emotion. Claudia M. Haase of Northwestern University and Ursula Beermann of the University of Geneva co-authored the study, which was conducted in the laboratories of Dacher Keltner and Robert W. Levenson at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. In the study, the scientists looked at short and long alleles of the gene 5-HTTLPR, which is involved in the regulation of serotonin, a neurotransmitter implicated in depression and anxiety. An allele is a variant of a gene. Each gene has two alleles; humans inherit one allele from mom and one from dad. Early research suggested that the short alleles predicted unwanted or negative outcomes, such as depression, anxiety and substance abuse. People with short alleles were found to have higher negative emotions than those with long alleles. But the latest study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that people with short alleles also may be more sensitive to the emotional highs of life. ""Having the short allele is not bad or risky,"" said Haase, an assistant professor in the Human Development and Social Policy program at Northwestern's School of Education and Social Policy. ""Instead, the short allele amplifies emotional reactions to both good and bad environments."" ""Our study provides a more complete picture of the emotional life of people with the short allele,"" Haase added. ""People with short alleles may flourish in a positive environment and suffer in a negative one, while people with long alleles are less sensitive to environmental conditions."" ""The fundamental truth of genes is that they don't have the final say,"" said senior author Levenson, a leading researcher in human emotions and professor in the department of psychology at UC-Berkeley. ""There's always an interaction between nature and nurture that shapes outcomes, and this study is another example of that."" The latest study combined three experiments from different Berkeley labs. In the first experiment, young adults were shown cartoons from ""The Far Side"" by Gary Larson and The New Yorker. In the second experiment, young, middle-aged and older adults watched a subtly amusing clip from the film ""Strangers in Paradise."" The final experiment asked middle-aged and older spouses to discuss an area of disagreement in their marriage. The scientists videotaped the volunteers during the experiments. Trained researchers then coded smiling and laughter using the ""Facial Action Coding System,"" which describes small movements in the face, said Beermann, a postdoctoral researcher at the Swiss Center for Affective Sciences at University of Geneva. The study focused on genuine or 'real' positive emotional expressions. People sometimes smile or laugh -- even if they don't find something funny -- simply to be polite or to hide negative feelings, Beermann said. ""So when you measure smiling and laughing, you want to be able to distinguish real laughs and smiles from the ones that aren't,"" she said. The important clues lie in the muscle around the eyes that produce the so-called 'crow's feet,'"" Beermann said. ""Those can only be seen in real smiles and laughs,"" she said. Overall, 336 participants were included in the final analysis. The researchers collected saliva samples from the volunteers to analyze the 5-HTTLPR gene. The data from the three experiments combined indicated that people with the short allele of 5-HTTLPR showed greater positive emotional expressions. Specifically, people with the short allele displayed greater genuine smiling and laughing than people with the long allele. ""This study provides a dollop of support for the idea that positive emotions are under the same tent as negative ones, when it comes to the short allele,"" Levenson said. ""It may be that across the whole palate of human emotions, these genes turn up the gain of the amplifier. It sheds new light on an important piece of the genetic puzzle.""

The company, based in Boston, is developing a novel class of molecular therapeutics from the human microbiome. Symbiotix  lead clinical candidate, Polysaccharide A (PSA), is the first molecule to emerge from the microbiome and the $2.3 million NIH award enables the completion of key translational studies and production of material needed to take into human clinical trials as a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), said Prof. Lloyd Kasper, Professor of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, and Co-Founder of Symbiotix. PSA is a first-in-class oral therapy that works through a novel mechanism of action related to activation of regulatory T cells, which exert an anti-inflammatory effect through the production of IL-10.  Current FDA-approved therapies for multiple sclerosis offer only partial benefit for reduction of relapses and time to disability. However, all of these FDA-approved treatments have side effects some of which can be rather profound,  said Prof. Kasper.  We are developing PSA as a safe and effective new oral therapy for the over 500,000 US patients with multiple sclerosis. We expect PSA to have few, if any, significant side effects as it is derived from a commensal bacterial molecule that has evolved to modulate our immune system .

The funding is the second round of awards from the Horticulture and Potato Initiative (HAPI), which was developed by BBSRC together with NERC and the Scottish Government to support high quality, industrially relevant research projects on potato and edible horticulture crops. HAPI will help the horticulture and potato supply chains enhance their competitiveness and resilience to climate change, increase plant resistance to disease and environmental change, and develop more efficient ways of farming. This will lead to economic, social and environmental benefits, such as improved resilience to climate change and better food security. The funding includes  4M from BBSRC and  280,000 from NERC. Research funded through the call will address key areas identified with industry such as pests and pathogens, seed quality and resource use efficiency. Dr Celia Caulcott, BBSRC Executive Director, Innovation and Skills said:  Working with industrial partners, we have identified key areas where research is necessary to help address the challenges of a sustainable food supply. These projects research will help to deliver improved yields, and reduce waste, in turn benefitting both producers and consumers in the UK and worldwide.  The six projects receiving funding are:   Apple Replant Disease (ARD) Evolution and Rootstock Interaction (ARDERI). Professor Xiangming Xu, East Malling Research ( 482,000)Apple replant disease is a serious threat affecting newly planted apple trees, which fail to thrive in areas where apples have previously grown. East Malling Research is collaborating with industry to provide detailed information about the disease, which could be used to develop new management strategies and breeding programmes to benefit one of the UK s major horticultural industries.   New UK potato varieties with late blight and potato cyst nematode resistance, reduced bruising and improved processing quality. Professor Jonathan Jones, The Sainsbury s Laboratory and Professor Peter Urwin, University of Leeds ( 841,000)Potatoes are an extremely important crop, playing a major role in global food security. However yields and suitability for consumption are reduced by several shortcomings in current varieties. This research aims to combine newly engineered traits into popular potato varieties to increase their resistance to diseases and bruising. If successful, the potatoes could be commercialized to both reduce waste and cost to consumers.   Exploiting seed coat properties to improve uniformity and resilience in Brassica seed vigour. Steven Penfield, John Innes Centre and Professor Julian Moger, University of ExeterIn a changing climate, increasing the resistance of plants is becoming increasingly important. The success of a seed is determined by the genetics of the crop, vigour-enhancing chemicals and crucially temperature at seed production. This research looks to develop new varieties of Brassica with high seed vigour that are insensitive to the effects of temperature during seed production. In addition, they hope to develop a technique that objectively monitors the uptake of important growth chemicals by seeds. The approach could be used to prioritize the development of important new chemicals and methods to maximize uptake.  Developing integrated approaches for pest and disease control in horticultural field crops (IAPAD). Dr John Walsh, The University of Warwick and Mr Martin Williamson, Rothamsted Research ( 925,000)Turnip yellows virus (TuYV), transmitted by a common greenfly species is a very important virus affecting brassicas. Unlike many other viruses, it does not show obvious symptoms and as a result, many growers are unaware of infection. Researchers are developing an integrated programme to give optimal control of TuYV. By analyzing plants with varying levels of susceptibility, the researchers will develop molecular markers, which seed companies could utilize in commercial varieties.   A genetic approach to improving post-harvest quality. Professor David Pink, Harper Adams University, Dr Carol Wagstaff, University of Reading and Dr Guy Barker, The University of Warwick ( 1,024,000)Post-harvest discolouration is a significant cause of quality loss in a wide range of fresh produce such as sliced apple, cut cabbage and lettuce. Researchers are collaborating with industry to identify the genes involved in the discolouration of lettuce leaves and how they behave under different growing conditions. Once identified, they will look at which lines show differences in discolouration and will measure their taste, as well as their resistance to aphids and mildew, applying the understanding to other crops such as apple and cabbage.   A systems approach to disease resistance against necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Dr Katherine Denby, The University of Warwick, Dr Carol Wagstaff, University of Reading and Dr Paul Hand, Harper Adams University ( 881,891)Fungal pathogens can cause very serious diseases in horticultural crops such as lettuce - an industry worth almost  200M annually in the UK. Chemical control is problematic for several reasons as few effective compounds are available and widespread fungicide use can lead to resistance. Researchers are developing a new approach to breeding in hope of developing resistant crops. By applying genomic and systems biology, they look to identify genes for increasing resistance to important fungal pathogens. This will provide a foundation to develop similar resistance to these pathogens in other horticultural crops.","Published: June 2, 2015"

RoosterBio and Sistemic will collaborate on utilizing microRNA (miRNA)-based cell characterization workflows and technologies to build more precise and relevant characterization panels for hMSC products and in process cell banks. The collaboration furthers the identification of microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers across a wide range of donors predictive of hMSC performance based on a matrix of biological functions and outcomes of interest. Both companies envisage offering their customers  access to the each other's technology platforms to enhance the quality, performance, and therapeutic knowledge of MSC technology. The eventual goal of the collaboration will be to erase the functional variability that is inherent in today s MSC products and drive the evolution of stem cells from a science to a robust technology. Since the initial identification and characterization by Friedenstein and his colleagues, in 1974, the understanding of MSC biology, function and therapeutic applicability has gone a long way with hMSCs currently being the most commonly used stem cell type in clinical applications. To date, it has been shown that MSCs exist and can be isolated from almost every tissue, possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple lineages and exhibit immense therapeutic potential, with tissue regeneration, wound healing and immune system modulation capabilities as examples. Nevertheless, MSCs are also rare, prone to senescence upon extended culture, exhibit variable potency and show wide donor to donor variability. Both RoosterBio and Sistemic recognize the significance of these challenges and are fully committed to developing solutions that will enable the full therapeutic potential and wide spread commercial use of MSC technology. Dr Daria Olijnyk, Senior Scientist and Business Development Associate of Sistemic said  Sistemic as a leading provider of miRNA-based tools for cell characterization and quality control of cell therapy products has a significant interest in and a detailed understanding of the field of MSC characterization and is fully committed to utilizing its expertise to provide innovative solutions to accelerate and optimize the clinical translation and cost-effective use of MSCs. We are very excited to announce our collaborative partnership with RoosterBio. We believe that with both companies working towards a common goal and combining our complementary expertise we will accelerate the development of a range of well characterized, easily scalable and highly potent MSC products which can be pre-selected based on their intended application. Combining Sistemic s informatics capabilities and extensive knowledge base on existing MSCs allows both companies to combine their strengths to understand and potentially overcome donor-to-donor variability which has been a significant industry challenge, up to this point in time.  Jon Rowley of RoosterBio, said  Collaborating with Sistemic is an example of a true  1+1 = 3  scenario. Thorough characterization of hMSC products and cell banks is central to crating a stable, robust technology that can be simply and affordably deployed across a range of applications - from cell therapies to 3D bioprinting. RoosterBio s rich library of MSC donors married with Sistemic s miRNA characterization platform will provide both predictive biomarkers and critical quality attributes that will allow MSC technology to reach its full potential, sooner. This collaboration will not only advance the science of stem cells, but accelerate the clinical and commercial translation of this technology.  The collaboration, while organic in nature, is also being driven by commercial interest and an, as yet, underserved market need. Both Sistemic and RoosterBio have respectively served their customers seeking greater MSC characterization, and will now do so with a unified effort. The collaboration will endeavour to accelerate the development and commercial potential of Regenerative Medicine products.","Published: June 2, 2015"

No treatment options are available for women infected with oncogenic HPV types but who have not yet developed high-grade lesions or cervical cancer: GTL002 seeks to eradicate the 6 most oncogenic HPV types affecting 158 million women worldwide. As a reminder, GTL001 (known in Europe as ProCervix), Genticel's first-in-class therapeutic vaccine candidate currently in phase 2 in Europe, already targets the 2 most oncogenic HPV types that affect 93 million women. With GTL001 and GTL002, Genticel is the first company that has established a staged pipeline of HPV therapeutic vaccines for the large female population burdened by this unmet medical need. The proof of concept data of GTL002 demonstrated that an in vivo immune response was induced against each of the 6 HPV-derived proteins present in the therapeutic vaccine. In addition, in vivo therapeutic efficacy was shown by tumor eradication in the most widely used and broadly accepted reference model. ""These positive results, coupled with robust manufacturing data that met stringent reproducibility, quality and yield criteria, provide a solid foundation to advance our multivalent HPV vaccine towards clinical development,"" stated Marie-Christine Bissery, Chief Scientific Officer of Genticel. She added: ""Genticel can now initiate the formal preclinical pharmacology, toxicology studies and GMP clinical lot production required for the preparation of an IND or a phase 1 trial in Europe that could start as early as 2017."" GTL002 is the first product candidate based on Genticel's proprietary Vaxiclase technology. This next-generation technology platform can be used with many antigens in multiple indications. In February 2015, Genticel signed a first licensing agreement with the Serum Institute of India Ltd. (SIIL), the world's largest producer of vaccine doses, to evaluate Vaxiclase for use in multivalent vaccines containing pertussis antigens. Under the terms of the agreement, Genticel receives up to $57 million in upfront and milestones payments, plus royalties on sales. ""Achieving in vivo preclinical proof of concept of GTL002 efficacy is an important milestone in strengthening Genticel's HPV therapeutic vaccine pipeline,"" concluded Benedikt Timmerman, Chief Executive Officer of Genticel. ""These positive data show our ability to deliver a follow-on HPV product candidate and support our confidence in Vaxiclase's substantial value in other therapeutic indications.""","Published: June 2, 2015"

Scientists at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, have found compelling evidence that poor sleep -- particularly a deficit of the deep, restorative slumber needed to hit the save button on memories -- is a channel through which the beta-amyloid protein believed to trigger Alzheimer's disease attacks the brain's long-term memory. ""Our findings reveal a new pathway through which Alzheimer's disease may cause memory decline later in life,"" said UC Berkeley neuroscience professor Matthew Walker, senior author of the study to be published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. Excessive deposits of beta-amyloid are key suspects in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, a virulent form of dementia caused by the gradual death of brain cells. An unprecedented wave of aging baby boomers is expected to make Alzheimer's disease, which has been diagnosed in more than 40 million people, one of the world's fastest-growing and most debilitating public health concerns. The good news about the findings, Walker said, is that poor sleep is potentially treatable and can be enhanced through exercise, behavioral therapy and even electrical stimulation that amplifies brain waves during sleep, a technology that has been used successfully in young adults to increase their overnight memory. ""This discovery offers hope,"" he said. ""Sleep could be a novel therapeutic target for fighting back against memory impairment in older adults and even those with dementia."" The study was co-led by UC Berkeley neuroscientists Bryce Mander and William Jagust, a leading expert on Alzheimer's disease. The team has received a major National Institutes of Health grant to conduct a longitudinal study to test their hypothesis that sleep is an early warning sign or biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. While most research in this area has depended on animal subjects, this latest study has the advantage of human subjects recruited by Jagust, a professor with joint appointments at UC Berkeley's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, the School of Public Health and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. ""Over the past few years, the links between sleep, beta-amyloid, memory, and Alzheimer's disease have been growing stronger,"" Jagust said. ""Our study shows that this beta-amyloid deposition may lead to a vicious cycle in which sleep is further disturbed and memory impaired."" Using a powerful combination of brain imaging and other diagnostic tools on 26 older adults who have not been diagnosed with dementia, researchers looked for the link between bad sleep, poor memory and the toxic accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins. ""The data we've collected are very suggestive that there's a causal link,"" said Mander, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory directed by Walker. ""If we intervene to improve sleep, perhaps we can break that causal chain."" A buildup of beta-amyloid has been found in Alzheimer's patients and, independently, in people reporting sleep disorders. Moreover, a 2013 University of Rochester study found that the brain cells of mice would shrink during non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep to make space for cerebrospinal fluids to wash out toxic metabolites such as beta-amyloid. ""Sleep is helping wash away toxic proteins at night, preventing them from building up and from potentially destroying brain cells,"" Walker said. ""It's providing a power cleanse for the brain."" Specifically, the researchers looked at how the quantity of beta-amyloid in the brain's medial frontal lobe impairs deep non-REM sleep, which we need to retain and consolidate fact-based memories. In a previous study, Mander, Jagust and Walker found that the powerful brain waves generated during non-REM sleep play a key role in transferring memories from the hippocampus -- which supports short-term storage for information -- to longer-term storage in the frontal cortex. In elderly people, deterioration of this frontal region of the brain has been linked to poor-quality sleep. For this latest study, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain; functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure activity in the brain during memory tasks; an electroencephalographic (EEG) machine to measure brain waves during sleep; and statistical models to analyze all the data. The research was performed on 26 older adults, between the ages of 65 and 81, who showed no existing evidence of dementia or other neurodegenerative, sleep or psychiatric disorders. First, they each received PET scans to measure levels of beta-amyloid in the brain, after which they were tasked with memorizing 120 word pairs, and then tested on how well they remembered a portion of them. The study participants then slept for eight hours, during which EEG measured their brain waves. The following morning, their brains were scanned using fMRI as they recalled the remaining word pairs. At this point, researchers tracked activity in the hippocampus, where memories are temporarily stored before they are transferred to the prefrontal cortex. ""The more you remember following a good night of sleep, the less you depend on the hippocampus and the more you use the cortex,"" Walker said. ""It's the equivalent of retrieving files from the safe storage site of your computer's hard drive, rather than the temporary storage of a USB stick."" Overall, the results showed that the study participants with the highest levels of beta-amyloid in the medial frontal cortex had the poorest quality of sleep and, consequently, performed worst on the memory test the following morning, with some forgetting more than half of the information they had memorized the previous day. ""The more beta-amyloid you have in certain parts of your brain, the less deep sleep you get and, consequently, the worse your memory,"" Walker said. ""Additionally, the less deep sleep you have, the less effective you are at clearing out this bad protein. It's a vicious cycle. ""But we don't yet know which of these two factors -- the bad sleep or the bad protein -- initially begins this cycle. Which one is the finger that flicks the first domino, triggering the cascade?"" Walker added. And that's what the researchers will determine as they track a new set of older adults over the next five years. ""This is a new pathway linking Alzheimer's disease to memory loss, and it's an important one because we can do something about it,"" Mander said.

A study by researchers at the University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine has demonstrated the validity of a new method for measuring pediatric pain levels using novel facial pattern recognition software.  The current methods by which we analyze pain in kids are suboptimal,  said senior author Jeannie Huang, MD, MPH, a professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics and a gastroenterologist at Rady Children s Hospital-San Diego.  In this study, we developed and tested a new instrument, which allowed us to automatically assess pain in children in a clinical setting. We believe this technology, which enables continuous pain monitoring, can lead to better and more timely pain management.  The researchers used the software to analyze pain-related facial expressions from video taken of 50 youths, ages five to 18 years old, who had undergone laparoscopic appendectomies at Rady Children s Hospital-San Diego. Based on the analysis, along with clinical data input by the study team, the software provided pain level scores for each participant. Huang said controlling pain is important, not only for the child s comfort, but also for recovery. Studies have shown that under-treatment of pain is associated with adverse surgical outcomes.  Accurate assessment of pain is a fundamental tenet of delivery of care,  she said. Several issues, particularly age-related communication difficulties, make existing pediatric pain assessment methods problematic, said Huang.  The current gold standard for measuring pain is self-reporting,  she said, noting patients are generally asked to rate their pain on a scale of zero to 10.  But in pediatrics there is a limited population of kids who can answer that question in a meaningful way. Younger children can have difficulty - a two-year-old hasn t developed the cognitive and conceptual abilities to think in those terms.  Clinical pain assessments, aided by nurses or parents, are often used in lieu of patient self-report in children because of these limitations. However, several previous studies have shown nursing staff may have difficulty accurately estimating pain (often underestimating pain), particularly among pediatric patients. Parents are generally more in tune with their children s pain levels, but may not always be available, said Huang.   Another problem with pain assessment protocols, Huang added, is that pain checks tend to be scheduled and consequently may not coincide with times when pain occurs and when intervention is needed.  Pain assessments are typically scheduled along with vital signs, the frequency of which can vary from every 4 to 8 hours depending on patient severity.  In the study, researchers filmed the participants at three different visits post-surgery: within 24 hours after an appendectomy; one calendar day after the first visit and at a follow-up visit 2 to 4 weeks after surgery.  Facial video recordings and self-reported pain ratings by the participant and pain ratings by parents and nurses were collected.    The research team sought to determine the software s accuracy at pain measurement as compared to self-reporting by the child and as compared to by proxy estimations by parents and nurses. The software prototype utilized data collected via prior software (Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox) by study co-author Marian Bartlett, PhD, at UC San Diego s Institute for Neural Computation, which utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze facial expressions based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). FACS measures facial expressions using 46 anatomically based component movements and has been used in many studies by Kenneth Craig, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia, a world renowned pain expert, and one of the study s co-authors.   The use of FACS in the past has allowed for identification of pain-related facial movements, but this project took facial movement and pain analysis one step further. In the software prototype, the study s authors translated the facial movement data into a pain score and then compared that with the information collected from the child s self-reporting and the parent and nurse by proxy pain estimations.    The software demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy in assessing pain conditions,  said Huang.  Overall, this technology performed equivalent to parents and better than nurses. It also showed strong correlations with patient self-reported pain ratings.  The software also did not demonstrate bias in pain assessment by ethnicity, race, gender, or age in the patient cohort studied. Since the instrument is capable of  operating in real-time and continuously,  using this approach to alert clinicians to instances of pain at the time they occur instead of during scheduled assessments might enhance efficient, timely allocation of pain interventions, noted Huang. Furthermore, such technology could potentially advocate for youth in pain when their parents are unavailable to notify medical staff regarding their child s pain level. Huang said the approach requires further investigation with other forms of clinical pain and across the broad age range of children.  It still needs to be determined whether such a tool can be easily integrated into clinical workflow and thus add benefit to current clinical pain assessment methods and ultimately treatment paradigms,  she said.

The dosage findings for the first 20 patients in the phase 1 trial presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago May 29-June 2 2015 (abstract #2068). ""The purpose of a phase 1 trial is to identify the optimal dose to minimize toxicity,"" said Annick Desjardins, M.D., lead author of the presentation and director of clinical research at the brain tumor center in the Duke Cancer Institute. ""Our trial design included escalating to higher doses, which is what is done with chemotherapy. ""For chemotherapy, we are trained to give the largest dose possible with acceptable toxicity, because that is how the drugs work to attack tumors,"" Desjardins said. ""But that does not appear to be necessary with our therapy, and in fact a lower dose attacks the tumor as well and results in fewer side effects."" At the higher doses, Desjardins and colleagues report, inflammation at the tumor site increased the severity of side effects, including weakness and seizures. Patients required prolonged steroid use to reduce the inflammation, but this also dampened the immune response that the modified poliovirus is designed to initiate. The research team has settled on a dose that is actually lower than the amount first tested, which the first study patient received in May 2012. That patient is still alive and has no regrowth of her tumor. Five patients have been enrolled in the trial at the lower dosage level, designated as minus one. ""We are now keeping to minus one,"" Desjardins said. ""Inflammation is much better at this level, and that's what we want."" Study authors report that the therapy appears to be safe, with side effects related to localized brain inflammation, including muscle weakness and paralysis, seizures, headaches, limb swelling and tingling, speech impairments, and headaches.

Announced today at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, the National Cancer Institute- Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) program is being led in partnership with ECOG-ACRIN and has received Investigational New Drug (IND) authorization by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA). The NCI-MATCH trial will be open to the NCI-supported National Clinical Trial Network with more than 2,400 regional facilities across the country. Supporting this study, as many as 3,000 tumor samples will be sequenced at the NCI Molecular Characterization Laboratory in Frederick, Md., The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Boston s Massachusetts General Hospital, and Yale University in New Haven, Conn. Each will use a standardized NGS protocol developed using Thermo Fisher s Oncomine reagents and the Ion Torrent sequencing system. This targeted sequencing approach, which is differentiated by its very low sample (DNA and RNA) requirement and faster turnaround time on the Ion Torrent platform, enables accurate and reliable sequence analysis across a large range of tumor sample types, including small biopsies and fine-needle aspirates.  Clinical trials of this size and type must rely on technology that can accurately detect a wide range of infrequent gene alterations with a single assay of small amounts of DNA and cDNA from a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen or fine needle aspiration specimen,  said ECOG-ACRIN laboratory lead, Stanley R. Hamilton, M.D., head of pathology and laboratory medicine at MD Anderson.  Meeting these requirements was a key deciding factor for choosing this platform after we completed our evaluation process. These same assay requirements will often apply to enabling precision medicine.  The targeted sequencing assay (test) includes 143 genes that were selected using the Oncomine Knowledgebase, the world s largest collection of oncology data and a resource long trusted by pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations (CROs) and translational research laboratories. The unique panel design also enables simultaneous sequencing of a wide range of genetic alterations, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), small insertions and deletions (indels), copy number changes, and chromosomal translocations. Using the sequencing results, the study s leads will assign program participants, if eligible, to one of several trial arms based on the genetic alterations associated with their tumor, rather than their type of cancer. The trial will include approximately 20 or more different drugs from multiple pharmaceutical partner companies. Multi-arm study designs like NCI-MATCH allow researchers to cast a wider net, which helps take into account relatively rare tumor mutations and helps drive the development of promising new therapies.  A study of this scale would not be feasible using the traditional one-sample, one-biomarker testing approach,  said Mark Stevenson, executive vice president and president, Life Sciences Solutions, for Thermo Fisher.  And it is the first nationwide oncology trial of its kind that will be conducted in the spirit of President Obama s Precision Medicine Initiative, which has the potential to transform the future of cancer care.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/sequence-shuffle-repeat-209145,Sequence  Shuffle  Repeat Researchers identify origin of chromosomal oddity in some cancer cells   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Surveys of the genomic terrain of cancer have turned up a curious phenomenon in some tumor cells: a massive rearrangement of DNA in one or a few chromosomes, thought to be produced during a single cell cycle. In a new study, scientists at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute demonstrated how this sudden, isolated shuffling of genetic material known as chromothripsis can occur. The discovery was made using live video images of single cells and technology for sequencing the genomes of those cells a combination researchers dubbed Look-Seq (pronounced  look-seek ). The technique makes it possible for scientists to see how changes in specific genes or chromosomes affect cell behavior, which is critical for understanding how genes function.  Only three to five percent of cancer cells show signs of chromothripsis, but the mechanism by which it occurs has been a puzzle,  said David Pellman, the HMS Margaret M. Dyson Professor of Pediatric Oncology at Dana-Farber and senior author of the new paper.  The cells have two distinctive features: a broad disarray in the genetic material of a single chromosome or a few chromosomes, as if the DNA was shredded and haphazardly stitched together; and an odd  notched  pattern of the amount of DNA in the affected chromosome, where sections containing a full complement of DNA alternate with sections where DNA copies have been lost.  The question has been whether this could happen in a Darwinian way, with a slow acquisition of changes over a number of cell divisions,  continued Pellman, who is also an associate member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  The evidence, however, points to an all-at-once event.  In the study Pellman and his colleagues trace chromothripsis to a glitch in cell division that can cause one of the newly formed daughter cells to be short one chromosome, while the other daughter cell inherits an extra one. The surplus chromosome doesn t always join the other chromosomes in the cell nucleus; often, it s stranded elsewhere in the cell and acquires its own tiny membrane, forming a  micronucleus.  After cell division, the micronucleus can rupture, potentially exposing the chromosome inside to damage. The chromosome is then absorbed into the nucleus, knitting its imperfect DNA into the cell s genetic programming. In theory, a micronucleus would make a perfect setting for the process of chromothripsis to unfold. The release of a single chromosome from a shattered micronucleus could cause that chromosome and only that chromosome to undergo DNA damage. The chromosome might lose some bits of DNA, while the remaining bits are stitched together haphazardly. Such random reassembly could account for the unusual fluctuation in the number of copies of DNA in a single chromosome in the affected cell.  The formation and breakdown of a micronucleus would seem to satisfy all the conditions by which chromothripsis could occur,  Pellman said. To see if it in fact explains what happens in cancer cells, he and his colleagues set out to recreate chromothripsis in the lab. The researchers treated cells with a drug that can spur the formation of micronuclei. They collected the ones that actually developed a micronucleus and viewed live images of them under a microscope: the  Look  part of Look-Seq. This enabled them to identify cells where the micronucleus ruptured at a key stage of the cell life cycle. After these cells had divided one time, researchers sorted through the pairs of daughter cells to find ones that didn t have a micronucleus. In such cells, the chromosome that had once been quarantined within the micronucleus had presumably escaped as the micronucleus burst, and rejoined its fellow chromosomes in the cell nucleus. The micronucleus-less cells were then genetically sequenced, and their strings of DNA read letter by letter. This constitutes the  Seq  part of Look-Seq, which was developed in collaboration with Matthew Meyerson, HMS professor of pathology at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. If chromothripsis does arise as a result of the formation and destruction of a micronucleus, as researchers theorized, it should occur in only one of a cell s two daughters the one that inherits a chromosome formerly wrapped in a micronucleus. The affected daughter cell, therefore, would have more copies of certain DNA sections than its sister cell does. When Pellman s team genetically sequenced pairs of daughter cells from nine cells with micronuclei, they found precisely this imbalance: one member of each pair had at least one chromosome with extra copies of DNA at some locations, while the other member did not. The researchers then tested their prediction that DNA rearrangements would be confined to the chromosome that was once AWOL and had later reunited with its mates. They found that, in eight of the nine pairs of daughter cells whose DNA had been sequenced, such rearrangements were indeed concentrated in that particular chromosome.  By forcing cells to develop micronuclei, we derived daughter cells that recapitulate all the features seen in chromothripsis,  said Pellman.  This is compelling evidence that this process is a major mechanism by which chromothripsis occurs in some cancers.  The findings support our lab s earlier research showing that the incorrect segregation of intact chromosomes prior to cell division can produce rearrangements of DNA that result in genetic mutations, potentially playing a role in cancer development,  he continued.  We also show that the Look-Seq technique is a powerful way of exploring the connection between genetic and molecular change and cell behavior. ","Published: June 1, 2015"

The new regulation is designed to provide a more streamlined approach to the conduct of trials with greater public openness about each trial and the results they produce. The implementation date is planned for the 28th May 2016.  IAOCR is delighted the EU has addressed the clear need for better regulation of clinical trials, however there is still a long way to go,  commented Martin Robinson PhD, Executive VP & IAOCR Ambassador.  These changes will work towards ensuring patient safety is at the forefront of clinical trials but the competence of those undertaking the trials is also required to ensure a robust, proficient and safe system is in place across Europe. IAOCR is committed to ensuring clinical researchers are qualified by education, training and experience and believes accreditation helps to ensure that Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is adhered to and that patients  rights and wellbeing are upheld.  The new regulation was approved by the European Parliament in April last year and has now been published in the official Journal of the European Union. It replaces directive 2001/20/EC   the Clinical Trial Directive which has been in place for almost a decade. The benefits associated with the new regulation include a single approval portal, standardized content of clinical trial applications, information about subject protection and informed consent, more stringent requirements for reporting trial progress and greater transparency about clinical trials.  The regulation will be applied in full in all member states, with no need for separate national legislation and this will result in consistent and uniform application throughout EU allowing the EU Commission to conduct controls in Member States making sure that rules are properly supervised and enforced.  IAOCR s Qualified Clinical Research Trainers have delivered training programs to over 250 clinical research organizations spanning five continents.

But when exactly does the immune system of babies born to obese mothers get compromised?  Very early in the baby s life, according to a new study by a research team led by Ilhem Messaoudi of the University of California, Riverside. The team analyzed umbilical cord blood samples of infants born to lean, overweight and obese mothers, and found that pre-pregnancy maternal weight has a significant impact on the immune system of the neonate, putting such children at risk for potential diseases such as heart disease and asthma.  A number of studies have linked maternal obesity   starting pregnancy with excess weight and gaining a lot of weight during pregnancy   to a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and asthma in children,  said Messaoudi, an associate professor of biomedical sciences in the School of Medicine at UC Riverside.  Our study offers potential links between changes in the offspring s immune system and the increased susceptibility and incidence of these diseases later in life.  The researchers used established body mass index (BMI) categories to sort the mothers participating in the study, BMI being a number calculated from height and weight. A mother was considered overweight if her BMI was 25 to 29.9. A mother was considered obese if her BMI was 30 or higher. The mothers were all non-smoking, had no diabetes, and had an uncomplicated gestation at term. Each mother delivered just one baby. Eleven mothers were lean, 14 were overweight, and 14 were obese. Thirty were white, three were Asian American/Pacific Islander, one was an American-Indian/Alaskan native, and two were African American.  The racial identity of three women was unknown.  We found that very specific immune cells in circulation   monocytes and dendritic cells   isolated from babies born to moms with high BMI were unable to respond to bacterial antigens compared to babies born to lean moms,  Messaoudi said.  Such babies also showed a reduction in  CD4 T-cells.  Both of these changes could result in compromised responses to infection and vaccination.  Further, the researchers found that cells (eosinophils) that play a role in allergic response and asthma pathogenesis were significantly reduced in the umbilical cord blood of babies born to obese mothers. One potential explanation for these observations is that these cells have already moved into the lungs, which could explain the increased incidence of asthma observed later in life in children born to obese mothers. The research is the first to show the link between maternal obesity during pregnancy and neonatal immune outcomes, and shows that changes in immunity are already detectable at birth and could persist for the lifetime of the child into adulthood.  This could change how we respond to vaccination and how we respond to asthma-inducing environmental antigens,  Messaoudi said.  As we know, in the first two years of life, children typically receive plenty of vaccines. The questions that arise are: Are the responses to vaccines in infants born to obese moms also impaired in the first two years of life? Should we change how often we vaccinate children born to obese moms? Should we change practices of how much and how often we vaccinate?  Messaoudi sees the research paper as a launching point for further studies and a call to action.  If you are thinking of becoming or are already pregnant, talk to your ob-gyn about weight management, weight gain and the ideal targets for weight gain,  she said.  When moms come in for prenatal visits, doctors tell them about smoking, recreational drug use, and alcohol.  But they should be talking also about weight and weight management.  Obesity has serious repercussions for maternal health.  It is associated with low fertility and success with pregnancy.  Rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placental abruption   all of these risks increase dramatically with weight gain and obesity.  So it is important to talk to your doctor about ideal weight entering into pregnancy and throughout pregnancy. ","Published: June 1, 2015"

They also discovered that honey bee larvae infected with the microsporidian have reduced lifespans as adults. Honey bees are a critical link in U.S. agriculture as crop pollinators. Since 2006, beekeepers in North America and Europe have lost about one-third of their managed bee colonies each year due to  colony collapse disorder.  While the exact cause is unknown, scientists have speculated that pesticides, pathogens, mites and certain beekeeping practices all have contributed to this decline. Nosema ceranae, a kind of fungal pathogen spread by spores, also is implicated in colony collapse because it reduces colony health and is widespread.  Previous research suggested that Nosema ceranae could not infect honey bee larvae,  said James Nieh, a professor of biology at UC San Diego who headed the research effort with graduate student Daren Eiri, the first author of the study.  But this was largely based upon indirect evidence: spore counts in newly emerged adult bees, which typically have low spore counts.  Because Eiri and his co-authors conducted their experiments with larvae exposed to spores and reared in the laboratory, they said the extent of larval infection needs to be studied further using field bee colonies to determine the true impact of larval infection on colony health. Nieh noted that a study conducted recently by other scientists detected low levels of Nosema DNA in honey bee larvae, suggesting that larval infection can occur in field colonies.  However, no study had directly investigated whether larvae could become infected with Nosema ceranae,  said Eiri.  Our study provides a direction to continue investigating this question outside the lab and in the field using entire colonies The UC San Diego discovery also may clarify a mystery.  One puzzling aspect of Nosema ceranaeinfection is that infection in adult bees usually decreases after medication is given by beekeepers to a colony, but can later resurge,  Nieh said.  Some of this resurgent infection could be due to transmission between bee colonies or to adult bees that have a low, but resistant level of infection.   However, our study raises the possibility that brood are also infected. If so, this typically would not be detected for weeks until the emergence of adult bees. Generally, older adult bees are more heavily infected with Nosema. Thus, bees infected as brood may not develop high Nosema spore counts until they are much older adults, further delaying detection.  Those unanswered questions suggest the impact of this microspordian on honey bee colonies deserves a second look.  We hope that our study will spur further research into how Nosema ceranae is transmitted and into the potential infection of larvae in natural and managed honey bee colonies in the field,  said Nieh.","Published: June 1, 2015"

The chickens were bought from large UK retail outlets and smaller independent stores and butchers. The data shows variations between the retailers, but none has met the target for reducing campylobacter (see table below). A full analysis of the survey results, including the publication of the raw data and the full year results for smaller supermarkets and shops, is being carried out by the FSA and will be published later in the summer. Further details of the ongoing testing of chickens for campylobacter were also confirmed by the FSA. A new survey will start this summer and once again sample fresh whole chickens from all types of shops. Continued testing will help the FSA to measure the impact of the interventions now being introduced by the industry to tackle campylobacter. The FSA has welcomed the publication today of case studies by Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, the Co-op and Waitrose  showing the results of their recently implemented campylobacter reduction plans. The data show significant decreases in the incidence of campylobacter on their raw whole chickens. The tests were carried out on more recent samples than those taken from the FSA survey samples, with some targeted to demonstrate the effect of particular interventions. Steve Wearne, FSA Director of Policy, said:  I am absolutely delighted to see the really encouraging results from these four supermarkets and their suppliers. They are making a real difference to public health, helping to cut down on the estimated 280,000 people who get ill from campylobacter each year.  As we have always said, if you are prepared to work across the food chain to reduce the spread of this bug then you will get results.  I want to challenge those retailers who haven t yet demonstrated the impact that M&S, Morrisons, the Co-op and Waitrose are having on reducing campylobacter on chickens on their shelves.  We expect all retailers and processors to be achieving the reductions we have seen in these retailers  figures   that s the only way we will meet the target we all signed up to.  We are going to run this survey for a second year and will again look at campylobacter levels on chickens at retail sale. I hope that we will be able to see the results from the actions taken by the four retailers mentioned above and others come through and produce much lower figures for the incidence of campylobacter on the chicken we buy.  Richard MacDonald, Chair of the ACT (Acting on Campylobacter Together) Board, said:  I have been impressed by the level of commitment and tangible action being taken by a number of retailers and processors of chicken. I hope we continue to see further progress in our fight to significantly reduce or even eradicate campylobacter on chickens.

Novozymes will be responsible for in-vitro screening, development and production, while Adisseo will manage in-vivo testing, marketing and sales. The partners expect to launch the product within the next 12 months.  The world needs new solutions to feed a growing global population in a sustainable way. We are developing a probiotic that can help farmers meet that need,  says Helle Warrer Poulsen, Vice President of Animal Health & Nutrition at Novozymes.  We are excited to partner with Adisseo, who shares our vision of bringing innovation and science to the field of probiotics and offers great expertise and capabilities in feed additives. It is a promising new area for Novozymes where we can leverage our know-how in microbiology, fermentation and animal feed.   Innovation is part of Adisseo s DNA and we are constantly investing, either organically or through strategic partnerships, in new solutions to help our customers optimize livestock performance while reducing environmental impact,  says Jean-Marc Dublanc, CEO of Adisseo.  The decision to enlarge our specialty portfolio with probiotics was therefore a natural one, as was the choice of Novozymes as our partner.  For decades, antibiotics have been widely used in animal production to help livestock grow, but more and more countries are now banning non-medicinal use as part of strategies to tackle resistance to antibiotic treatments in humans. Consumer-driven curbs on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters have further increased the demand for sustainable alternatives in animal farming. Probiotics are naturally-occurring live microbes added to feed to improve the gut flora of pigs, poultry and other animals. They improve animal growth and feed utilization and have associated health benefits, thereby providing a natural alternative to antibiotic growth promoters. Novozymes and Adisseo s new product will be based on beneficial bacteria that promote weight gain and limit development of unwanted bacteria in the animal s digestive tract. By using the product, farmers will better control gut health of their animals and achieve an improved feed conversion, meaning less feed consumed to raise an animal. The product will be tailored for poultry, while the partners will explore future opportunities to expand into probiotics for both poultry and swine. The partnership brings together global players with a solid track record in developing high performance feed additives who share an ambition to enter and develop the market for probiotics.

What has had scientists perplexed in recent years is not the cause of melanoma, but the mechanisms underlying the switch to a drug-resistance phenotype toward a group of commonly prescribed drugs called BRAF inhibitors. Now, investigators at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Researcher Institute believe they have charted the molecular pathways that lead to melanoma resistance and have developed methods to overcome the resistance phenotype possibly providing a novel effective approach for improving the clinical outcome of patients with BRAF inhibitor resistant tumors.   Typically, BRAF inhibitors have been prescribed for late-stage melanoma cases and represent a significant advance in the clinical management of the disease, relative to previous first-line therapies. Moreover, since roughly 50% of melanoma tumors are drive by mutations in the BRAF gene, this class of drug seems a logical choice for therapeutic intervention. However, although BRAF inhibitors rapidly and effectively shrink melanoma tumors, success is often limited as most tumors become resistant to the drugs within a few months.     ""Melanoma tumors can develop resistance to BRAF inhibitors by using alternate signaling pathways that promote cell growth,"" explained Ze'ev Ronai, Ph.D., scientific director of Sanford-Burnham's La Jolla campus and senior author on the current study. ""Our study has identified a different pathway, JAK1, as a driver of resistance to BRAF inhibitors, and suggests that targeting JAK1 could overcome such resistance, thereby improving the durability of the response to BRAF inhibitors."" The investigators analyzed drug-resistance within human tumor biopsies, mice transfected with human melanoma tumors, and in vitro melanoma cell lines. What the researchers found was that resistant tumors had increased levels of the tyrosine kinase signaling molecule, JAK1, which led to increased expression of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been shown to promote cell proliferation. Consequently, the Sanford-Burnham scientists discovered that the increase in JAK1 was due to low levels of the protein that regulates its expression, ubiquitin ligase RNF125. With all of this information in tow, the researchers sought to determine if the drug resistance phenotype could be circumvented. They identified that, not only does RNF125 expression in melanoma specimens inversely correlate with BRAF inhibitor resistance, but the combination of JAK, BRAF, and EGFR inhibitors was able to overcome the drug-resistance phenotype. ""By helping us understand that lower levels of RNF125 confer resistance to BRAF inhibitors, we have a new strategy to stratify patients for currently approved therapy versus participation for human clinical trials to investigate whether targeting JAK1 will be more effective in patients whose tumors exhibit reduced RNF125,"" concluded co-author Keith Flaherty, M.D., associate professor at Harvard Medical School and director of Developmental Therapeutics Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It will be important to determine whether JAK1 therapy alone or in combination with EGFR and BRAF inhibitors will elicit a better response.""","Published: June 1, 2015"

Cyramza is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 antagonist designed to work by binding and inhibiting activation of VEGF Receptor 2 while blocking the binding of VEGF receptor ligands VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. In an animal model, Cyramza was shown to inhibit angiogenesis. In the U.S., Cyramza is approved alone or in combination with paclitaxel for advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, whose cancer has progressed on or after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy. The drug is also approved in the U.S. in combination with docetaxel for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy; as well as with Folfiri for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose cancer has progressed on or after therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. MEDI4736 is a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to fight cancer by blocking signals from PD-L1 that help tumors avoid detection by the immune system. Developed by AstraZeneca s global biologics R&D arm MedImmune,  MEDI4736 has been advanced into Phase III clinical development in non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.

These findings are important, researchers say, because they identify a critical piece of evidence for how the Earth responds to changes in climate. ""Essentially what happened was that the cold water influx altered the rainfall patterns at the middle of the globe,"" said Rachael Rhodes, a research associate in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State Univ. and lead author on the study, which was funded by the National Science Foundation. ""The band of tropical rainfall, which includes the monsoons, shifts to the north and south through the year. ""Our data suggest that when the icebergs entered the North Atlantic causing exceptional cooling, the rainfall belt was condensed into the Southern Hemisphere, causing tropical wetland expansion and abrupt spikes in atmospheric methane,"" she added. During the last ice age, much of North America was covered by a giant ice sheet that many scientists believe underwent several catastrophic collapses, causing huge icebergs to enter the North Atlantic phenomena known as Heinrich events. And though they have known about them for some time, it hasn't been clear just when they took place and how long they lasted. Rhodes and her colleagues examined evidence from the highly detailed West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core. They used a new analytical method perfected in collaboration with Joe McConnell at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada, to make extremely detailed measurements of the air trapped in the ice. ""Using this new method, we were able to develop a nearly 60,000-year, ultra-high-resolution record of methane much more efficiently and inexpensively than in past ice core studies, while simultaneously measuring a broad range of other chemical parameters on the same small sample of ice,"" McConnell noted. Utilizing the high resolution of the measurements, the team was able to detect methane fingerprints from the Southern Hemisphere that don't match temperature records from Greenland ice cores. ""The cooling caused by the iceberg influx was regional but the impact on climate was much broader,"" said Edward Brook, an internationally recognized paleoclimatologist from Oregon State Univ. and co-author on the study. ""The iceberg surges push the rain belts, or the tropical climate system, to the south and the impact on climate can be rather significant."" Concentrating monsoon seasons into a smaller geographic area ""intensifies the rainfall and lengthens the wet season,"" Rhodes said. ""It is a great example of how inter-connected things are when it comes to climate,"" she pointed out. ""This shows the link between polar areas and the tropics, and these changes can happen very rapidly. Climate models suggest only a decade passed between the iceberg intrusion and a resulting impact in the tropics.""

The study, published in the open access Nature Publishing Group journal Scientific Reports, reveals a direct link between the main culprit of Alzheimer's disease and memory loss. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain tissue. These amyloid plaques are made up of an insoluble protein, ""Amyloid-beta"" (Abeta), which forms small structures called ""oligomers"" that are important in the disease progression. Although these proteins are known to be involved in Alzheimer's, little is understood about how they lead to the memory loss. Sussex Neuroscience researchers investigated how Abeta affected healthy brains of pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis) by observing the effect of administering the protein following a food-reward training task. The results showed that snails treated with Abeta had significantly impaired memories 24 hours later when tested with the food task, even though their brain tissue showed no sign of damage. Lead author on the study Lenzie Ford said this demonstrated that Abeta alone is enough to lead to the symptoms of memory loss that are well known in Alzheimer's disease. She said: ""What we observed was that snail brains remained apparently healthy even after the application of the protein. There was no loss of brain tissue, no signs of cell death, no changes in the normal behavior of the animals, and yet memory was lost. ""This shows that Alzheimer's amyloid proteins don't just affect memory by killing neurons of the brain, they seem to be targeting specific molecular pathways necessary for memories to be preserved."" Professor George Kemenes, a Sussex neuroscientist who pioneered a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory in the pond snail's nervous system, said: ""Because we understand the memory pathways so well, the simple snail brain has provided the ideal model system to enable us to link the loss of established memory to pure Abeta."" The work will provide a platform for a more thorough investigation of the mechanisms and effects on memory pathways that lead to this memory loss. Professor Serpell, a senior author on the study and co-director of the University of Sussex's Dementia Research Group, said: ""It is absolutely essential that we understand how Alzheimer's disease develops in order to find specific targets for therapeutics to combat this disease.""

Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism An essential component of current research initiatives on brain disorders is to enhance our understanding of normal and atypical brain development and how certain trajectories impact or underlie disease-related phenotypes. Studying brain disorders is inherently difficult, mostly due to their heterogeneity, genetic and biological complexity, and high comorbidity with other disorders. One strategy to enhance our understanding of these disorders is to identify core features that lend themselves to systematic and longitudinal investigations.

She derives stem cells from them to grow budding brain tissue harboring the secrets of his unique illness in a petri dish. She uses the information to genetically engineer a personalized treatment to correct his brain circuit functioning. Just Sci-fi? Yes, but... An evolving  disease-in-a-dish  technology, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is bringing closer the day when such a seemingly futuristic personalized medicine scenario might not seem so far-fetched. Scientists have perfected mini cultured 3-D structures that grow and function much like the outer mantle   the key working tissue, or cortex   of the brain of the person from whom they were derived. Strikingly, these  organoids  buzz with neuronal network activity. Cells talk with each other in circuits, much as they do in our brains. Sergiu Pasca, M.D., of Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, and colleagues, debut what they call  human cortical spheroids,  in the journal Nature Methods.  There s been amazing progress in this field over the past few years,  said Thomas R. Insel, M.D., Director of the NIH s National Institute of Mental Health, which provided most of the funding for the study.  The cortex spheroids grow to a state in which they express functional connectivity, allowing for modeling and understanding of mental illnesses. They do not even begin to approach the complexity of a whole human brain. But that is not exactly what we need to study disorders of brain circuitry. As we seek advances that promise enormous potential benefits to patients, we are ever mindful of the ethical issues they present.  Prior to the new study, scientists had developed a way to study neurons differentiated from stem cells derived from patients  skin cells   using a technology called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). They had even produced primitive organoids by coaxing neurons and support cells to organize themselves, mimicking the brain s own architecture. But these lacked the complex circuitry required to even begin to mimic the workings of our brains. Based on an improved, streamlined method for producing iPSCs, Pasca s team s cortex-like spheroids harbor healthier neurons supported by a more naturalistic network of supporting glial cells, resulting in more functional neural connections and circuitry. Like the developing brain, the neurons form layers and talk with each other via neural networks. The spheroid technology is more consistent than earlier organoids in generating the same kinds of cortex-like structures in repeated experiments. The budding cortex also lends itself to analysis using conventional brain slice methods. So, in a sci-fi future, it might potentially reveal what circuits went awry in the developing cortex of a particular individual with a brain disorder.  While the technology is still maturing, there is great potential for using these assays to more accurately develop, test safety and effectiveness of new treatments before they are used in individuals with a mental illness,  said David Panchision, Ph.D., NIMH program director for stem cell research. What s next? Perhaps development of multiple neuron subtypes that normally populate the cortex, as well as long-distance connections between this cortex-like structure and other -- yet to be developed   organoid structures.

If so, this could be putting you at risk for binge eating. According to Kelly Klump, professor of psychology at Michigan State University and senior author, the more impulsive you are, the more likely it is you'll binge eat when experiencing negative feelings. 'It's human nature to want to turn to something for comfort after a bad day, but what our research found is that the tendency to act rashly when faced with negative emotions is a personality trait that can lead to binge eating,' Klump said. Binge eating -- the uncontrollable consumption of a large amount of food in a short period of time -- doesn't just happen because someone's had a rotten day, it's tied to how impulsive you are. Klump and her team interviewed 612 female twins, of which 14 percent had binge eating, overeating (consumption of a large amount of food without a loss of control) or loss of control over eating (difficulty controlling one's consumption of even a small amount of food). They determined that people with these eating problems generally had higher levels of 'negative urgency,' or a tendency to act impulsively when experiencing negative emotions, than those who did not have pathological eating. What's more, it's not just those with binge eating who act impulsively when upset. 'Both overeating and feeling out of control when eating small or normal amounts of food were related to rash action when experiencing negative emotions,' said Sarah Racine, assistant professor of psychology at Ohio University and lead author on the research. Although negative urgency was high in those people who set out to overeat and those who lose control when eating, Racine believes there may be different factors at play for these two types of problem eating. 'It is possible that relationships between binge eating and negative urgency reflect impairments in behavioral control over eating when upset,' said Racine. 'Overeating may instead represent increased sensitivity to rewarding effects of food in the context of negative emotions.' This research has important implications for treatment, Klump said. 'If we can treat the underlying tendency to jump to eating when feeling negative emotions like stress, we may be able to help thousands of individuals who suffer from a range of eating disorders.'

Their research shows that even during quiet moments, our brains are preparing us to be socially connected to other people.  The brain has a major system that seems predisposed to get us ready to be social in our spare moments,  said Matthew Lieberman, a UCLA professor of psychology and of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences.  The social nature of our brains is biologically based.  The research helps resolve a nearly 20-year-old mystery. Neuroscientists have known since the 1990s that the brain includes a network of regions that seems to be most active during periods of rest   this became apparent when they examined brain scans of people who were attempting to answer challenging questions during scientific experiments and noticed that certain areas of the brain became unusually active during the periods in between the problem-solving. But until now, scientists knew very little about what purpose is served by the brain s activity during those interludes. The UCLA research, published in the June print edition of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, shows that during quiet moments, the brain is preparing to focus on the minds of other people   or to  see the world through a social lens,  said Lieberman, the study s senior author. In experiments at UCLA s Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, the researchers showed photos with captions to 21 people, and tracked their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. Most of the photos showed people performing actions in a social setting and expressing a certain emotion. In one set of 40 photographs, images were paired with captions that reflected the person s mental state    He is feeling bored  or  She is expressing self-doubt,  for example. The second set of photos had identical images, but with captions that merely described what the person was doing    He is resting his head  or  She is looking to her side.  And a third set of images depicted a number accompanied by a simple mathematical equation   for example,  10: 18-8.  Participants were asked to judge whether the captions accurately expressed what the images showed. Among the findings: The difference in decision-making speed that the researchers observed could have a significant effect in people s everyday lives, Lieberman said.  It might not seem like a huge advantage, but being 10 percent faster, time after time, in each conversation will allow a person to be much better prepared and in control of their social lives.  Lieberman, author of the best-selling book  Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect,  describes the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as the  CEO of the social brain.  It s part of a network in the brain that turns on when we dream and during periods of rest, in addition to when we explicitly think about other people, he said. Based on activity in that region of the brain when the study participants were resting, researchers could accurately predict how quickly the participants would perform the next task. When the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was highly active before participants saw a photo with a description of a mental state, they were faster in making their judgment; when the region was only slightly active, their decision-making was slower. The phenomenon applied equally among men and women.  It s the same photograph; the only thing that differs is whether the caption is mind-focused or body-focused,  said lead author Robert Spunt, who conducted the research when he was a UCLA doctoral student in psychology and is now a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech.  It s remarkable.  Lieberman said that people who struggle to read social cues in other people s facial expressions might be able to improve this skill with practice, and he is conducting additional research to examine whether certain kinds of practice at social thinking can help improve people s social abilities more broadly. The findings suggest that the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex might turn on during dreams and rest in order to process our recent social experiences and update our assumptions and understanding of the social world, Lieberman said.    It is getting us ready to see the world socially in terms of other people s thoughts, feelings and goals,  he said.  That indicates it is important; the brain doesn t just turn systems on. We walk around with our brain trying to reset itself to start thinking about other minds.  So although Facebook might not have been designed with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in mind, the social network is very much in sync with how our brains are wired.  When I want to take a break from work, the brain network that comes on is the same network we use when we re looking through our Facebook timeline and seeing what our friends are up to,  said Lieberman, one of the founders of the field of study known as social cognitive neuroscience.  That s what our brain wants to do, especially when we take a break from work that requires other brain networks.  UCLA   Original reporting by: Stuart Wolpert Robert P. Spunt, Meghan L.

Mikala Egeblad, Ph.D., associate professor, and her team looked at two types of breast cancer driven by different mutations, and found  different microenvironments. One common factor was the presence of  extracellular protein matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). It was expressed at similar levels in tumors from both breast cancer mouse models. MMP9 previously has been linked to the progression of many types of cancers. When the researchers deleted the Mmp9 gene, they found that the absence of the MMP9 protein delayed tumor onset only in one mouse model, and had no effect in the other model. Dr. Egeblad and her team found that whether MMP9 promoted cancer or not depended on the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, on the presence of another molecule that MMP9 is known to act on, i.e., insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1).  MMP9 has different effects on breast cancer progression depending on whether IGFBPs are expressed,  wrote the investigators. ""If IGFBP-1 is not there, MMP9 didn't really have an effect, but if it's there, then MMP9 has a role,"" says Dr. Egeblad. This suggests that IGFBP-1 interacts with MMP9 to promote tumor formation. IGFBP-1 binds insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which play a role in promoting cancer proliferation. ""IGFBP-1 keeps the growth factors sequestered so they can't act on the cancer cells and can't make them proliferate,"" continues Dr. Egeblad. ""But if MMP9 is present, it degrades these IGFBPs and releases the growth factors."" The release of the IGFs then accelerates cancer progression. Dr. Egeblad and her team looked in human cancer databases to see if the interaction between MMP9 and IGFBPs predicted breast cancer prognosis in humans. ""We found that IGF-binding proteins are associated with a good prognosis, but if MMP9 is also present, there's no longer good association with survival,"" she explains. The study's results have implications for anti-cancer drugs that target MMPs, and may explain why previous clinical trials using MMP inhibitors have failed, according to Dr. Egeblad. ""Maybe you can actually think about using these inhibitors if you better understand their biology."" The new study suggests that trials of MMP inhibitors could focus on patients whose tumor microenvironment contains IGFBPs. More broadly, the research suggests that it may not be enough to see if a particular drug target is present in a certain type of cancer; researchers may also need to look for the presence of the molecules that the drug target acts upon. ""It complicates things, but I think biologically it makes a lot of sense. You really need to dig deep and understand mechanistically what the target does,"" says Dr. Egeblad. The lab's next goal is to look more generally at the differences in microenvironments in different types of cancer. ""What we're starting to learn now is that the microenvironments are different in different tumors, and that there is really a very intricate interplay between what's driving the mutations in cancer cells and the type of microenvironment they build around themselves,"" points out Dr. Egeblad.","Published: May 29, 2015"

""However, white matter damage has a central role in how the disease strikes and progresses."" AD is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease is characterized by abnormal deposits of proteins that form amyloid plaques and tau tangles throughout the brain and a loss of neurons that causes brain tissue to shrink over time. Where or how the disease begins is not completely understood. Study leader Massimo Filippi, M.D., and his team of researchers used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess the white matter tracts in 53 patients with three types of AD: early-onset AD and two atypical types of AD called focal syndromes because they affect localized parts of the brain. Unlike late-onset AD that occurs after age 65 and is characterized primarily by progressive memory loss, patients with early-onset AD have impairment in several regions of the brain, including deficits in executive functioning and visuospatial abilities. Focal AD syndromes may cause visual disturbances or language deficits. DTI, a specialized magnetic resonance imaging technique that uses the movement of water molecules to characterize the microstructure of biological tissues, is highly sensitive to white matter degeneration. ""Our goal was to use DTI to identify similarities and differences in white tract damage across the AD spectrum and in relation to patterns of cortical atrophy,"" Dr. Agosta said. The researchers' analysis of the images revealed that all of the patients had extensive white matter damage, and showed regional gray matter damage. ""The white matter damage in patients with focal AD syndromes was much more severe and widespread than expected and cannot be explained solely by gray matter atrophy which was more localized,"" Dr. Agosta said. She said the team's findings support the theory that AD pathology may travel along white matter fibers from one region of the brain to another. ""In early-onset AD and atypical AD forms, white matter degeneration may be an early marker that precedes gray matter atrophy,"" Dr. Agosta said. ""DTI has the potential to assess the extensive disorganization of brain networks in focal AD even before overt cognitive deficits become apparent."" Dr. Agosta said the study's findings also underline the importance of identifying and diagnosing patients with early onset and focal AD syndromes. ""Because there is not much structural damage in the early stages of focal Alzheimer's disease, there is a risk that patients may be misdiagnosed and excluded from clinical trials,"" she said.","Published: May 29, 2015"

The PETA scientists published a study  which found that 98.8 percent of animals in NIH-funded laboratories were not covered by the Animal Welfare Act. The use of the unregulated animals increased about 72 percent from 1997 to 2012   while use of cats, dogs and other larger animals that are covered under the AWA remained constant, they found. The two groups are advocating that the ICCVAM begin to count all animals, big and small, and pushin vitro methods of testing, rather than in vivo testing.  In order to see a reduction in the use of animals, it is critical that industry use non-animal methods and that these methods be accepted by regulatory agencies,  they said in their statements.","Published: May 29, 2015"

Until now, how these cells detect a wounded or damaged site has largely remained a mystery. New research, led by University of Bristol academics in collaboration with a team from the University of Sheffield, has identified the triggers which lead these cells to react and respond in cell repair. It is hoped the findings, published in Current Biology, could help scientists design therapies to manipulate the cell repair process and direct immune cells away from sites where they are doing damage, such as tumours, and send them to places where they are needed. Previous studies had found that the earliest signal produced at a wound site responsible for attracting immune cells to the damaged site is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, it was still unclear how these cells detect this chemical, and what signalling occurs in these cells downstream of H2O2 detection to power their rapid migration.  Using the common fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) and timelapse microscopy, the team led by Professor Will Wood at the University of Bristol were able to study the process in situ and identify what causes the cells to migrate to sites of damage where they then detect, ingest and degrade debris, dying cells and invading pathogens. After dissecting the signalling occurring in immune cells responding to wound induced (H2O2), the team found that it involved a well-established immune signalling pathway used in vertebrate adaptive immune responses. The results suggest that adaptive immune signalling pathways important in distinguishing self from non-self in vertebrates appear to have evolved from a more ancient response designed to distinguished  damaged self  from  healthy self . Will Wood, Professor of Developmental Biology, in Bristol s School for Cellular and Molecular Medicine in the Faculty of Medical and Veterinary Sciences and the study s lead author, said:  While inflammation is critical to prevent infection, too much of a response by immune cells can cause or worsen a wide range of human diseases and conditions including autoimmunity, atherosclerosis, cancer and chronic inflammation.  This research is therefore critical for improving human health as it enables us to discover novel points of intervention to manipulate immune cell behaviour and allow us to design therapies to direct immune cells away from sites where they are doing damage and send them into places where they are needed.

Human height is a classic polygenic trait that is highly heritable and has been studied for a number of years to provide insight into aspects of human growth and development. Over the years a number of candidate genes have shown to be involved in height determination however, it is still unclear how these genes directly influence height or skeletal growth.   The VCU scientists observed that a targeted mutation in the sperm associated antigen 17 (SPAG17) gene led to skeletal malformations in mice, such as a shortened hind limb length, fused segments of the sternum, and defects in bone mineralization. ""The mouse tells us the relationship between SPAG17 and bone length, which would explain why there is an association with height,"" explained Jerome Strauss III, M.D., Ph.D., dean of the VCU School of Medicine and co-senior author on the current study. Interestingly, Dr. Strauss and his team first came across SPAG17 while studying genes that affected male infertility SPAG17 is involved in sperm motility. After generating a SPAG17 knockout mouse, the researchers expected to observe an infertile muse phenotype.    It turned out that this animal had other defects that we hadn t anticipated,  said Maria Teves, Ph.D., postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Strauss  lab and lead author on the current study.  The animals died within 12 hours of birth, their tibia and femur were shorter than the wild-type mice, and they had skeletal malformations and bone mineralization defects.  At this point, Dr. Strauss knew he needed some expertise in the area of musculoskeletal biology, so he looked to researchers within the VCU School of Engineering.    Researchers from Strauss  lab could see that a problem had occurred, but there are many techniques that we use in biomedical engineering that let us narrow in on what the defect is,  stated Barbara Boyan, Ph.D., dean of the VCU School of Engineering and co-senior author on the study. Investigators in Dr. Boyan s lab analyzed the bone shape and embryonic development of the SPAG17 deficient mice, as well as isolated bone cells for growth in culture, to determine if there was any alteration in the cells ability to form bone. Ultimately, both groups of investigators came to the same conclusion, which was that the bone malformations in the mice were due to the silencing of the SPAG17 gene and that osteoblasts and chondrocytes (bone forming cells) also expressed this gene.  This was an unexpected finding,  Dr. Boyan said.  It is not a protein that anybody in my field would have thought to look at.  Both groups were excited about their findings, but emphasized that more research needs to be conducted to fully understand the entire role of SPAG17 in bone development and structure.  Our findings are very important because they have revealed functions for SPAG17 that extend the role of this gene to regulation of skeletal development, growth, and mineralization,  Dr. Teves explained.  This was just the beginning. The next step is trying to find the mechanisms of why this gene influences skeletal development. ","Published: May 29, 2015"

The company will present an abstract of the data on Saturday, May 30th, from 8:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. as part of the poster session on Development Therapeutics. ARGX-111 is a c-Met-targeting human monoclonal SIMPLE Antibody  that modulates all known mechanisms of action of the receptor. As well as the blocking of both ligand-dependent and -independent signaling through c-MET, ARGX-111 benefits from POTELLIGENT -enhanced Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), which drives the immune system to destroy c-MET positive cells of the primary tumor and the circulating tumor cells that are responsible for metastasis; and from NHance , which drives tissue penetration in the hunt for tumor metastasis. This unique combination results in a potentially best-in-class drug candidate for c-Met therapies. ARGX-111 was investigated in a Phase I dose escalation study in 18 patients with advanced solid tumors over-expressing c-Met. The study yielded the initial safety profile and the dosing regimen for the next stage of clinical investigation. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Biological activity was clearly illustrated in a patient with gastric MET amplified cancer.  What is exciting about these ARGX-111 results is that the Phase I clinical data are a nice translation of the preclinical observations including successful depletion of circulation tumor cells and a marked impact on metastatic lesions in bone and lymph compartments ,  said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of arGEN-X.  Together with the established safety profile, we have strong support for the further development of ARGX-111 in MET amplified malignancies.

Now, two groups of scientists are reporting for the first time that two new nucleotides can do the same thing raising the possibility that entirely new proteins could be created for medical uses.  Synthetic biologists have been attempting for years to expand on nature s genetic  alphabet,  consisting of the nucleotide bases cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine also represented by the letters  C,   G,   A  and  T,  respectively. But so far, the potential additions they ve tested have shown limited promise. For example, one duo pairs up but doesn t form a nice helix, an important criterion given that the bases would have to incorporate fairly seamlessly with the original four to be useful. Millie M. Georgiadis, Steven A. Benner and colleagues from Indiana and Florida wanted to see if another potential set of letters,  Z  (6-amino-5-nitro-2(1H)-pyridone) and  P  (2-amino-imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4(8H)one), would form a helix and evolve. The researchers found that multiple Z-P pairs can contribute to a double helix, just as C-G and A-T pairs do, with the same combination of flexibility and rigidity required for natural DNA to function. They also showed that the Z-P pairs integrate well with conventional pairs and that six-letter GACTZP DNA can evolve. The evolution of DNA containing the new building blocks endows the structures with new properties that could be useful in protein recognition.","Published: May 29, 2015"

DLX1008 is a monovalent anti-VEGF-A antibody fragment that binds with 20-30 picomolar affinity to both human as well as mouse VEGF-A. VEGF-A is a key mediator of neo-angiogenesis promoting tumor growth by enhancing the supply of the tumor mass with nutrients and oxygen. Kaposi sarcoma is the most angiogenic cancer in the human population. It exists in a limited form where lesions develop predominantly on the skin only, and as a systemic disease, which is rapidly fatal, if untreated. Neutralizing VEGF-A starves the tumor by inhibiting neo-angiogenesis and by directly inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. A team led by Prof. Dirk P. Dittmer from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC had developed a xenograft mouse model based on Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus-positive human endothelial cells. Such mice were intraperitoneally treated with DLX1008. In these xenografted mice DLX1008 significantly retarded the tumor growth vis- -vis a control group (p   0.004), and immunohistochemistry confirmed that the tumor died from the inside out in response to DLX1008. Prof. Dittmer added that  this result is biologically even more impressive because of the biology of implant growth in this model. Cells on the outside of the skin implant will receive oxygen by passive diffusion as well as angiogenesis, the cells most dependent on angiogenesis are on the center of the implant.   DLX1008 is an excellent, highly potent antibody compound. As a result of its demonstrated antitumor activity, we will advance DLX1008 into clinical trials in oncological indications where angiogenesis plays a major role,  commented Thomas Hecht, MD, Executive Chairman of Delenex.","Published: May 29, 2015"

She derives stem cells from them to grow budding brain tissue harboring the secrets of his unique illness in a petri dish. She uses the information to genetically engineer a personalized treatment to correct his brain circuit functioning. Just Sci-fi? Yes, but... An evolving  disease-in-a-dish  technology, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is bringing closer the day when such a seemingly futuristic personalized medicine scenario might not seem so far-fetched. Scientists have perfected mini cultured 3-D structures that grow and function much like the outer mantle   the key working tissue, or cortex   of the brain of the person from whom they were derived. Strikingly, these  organoids  buzz with neuronal network activity. Cells talk with each other in circuits, much as they do in our brains. Sergiu Pasca, M.D.  External Web Site Policy, of Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, and colleagues, debut what they call  human cortical spheroids,  May 25, 2015 online in the journal Nature Methods.  There s been amazing progress in this field over the past few years,  said Thomas R. Insel, M.D., Director of the NIH s National Institute of Mental Health, which provided most of the funding for the study.  The cortex spheroids grow to a state in which they express functional connectivity, allowing for modeling and understanding of mental illnesses. They do not even begin to approach the complexity of a whole human brain. But that is not exactly what we need to study disorders of brain circuitry. As we seek advances that promise enormous potential benefits to patients, we are ever mindful of the ethical issues they present.  Prior to the new study, scientists had developed a way to study neurons differentiated from stem cells derived from patients  skin cells   using a technology called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). They had even produced primitive organoids by coaxing neurons and support cells to organize themselves, mimicking the brain s own architecture. But these lacked the complex circuitry required to even begin to mimic the workings of our brains. Based on an improved, streamlined method for producing iPSCs, Pasca s team s cortex-like spheroids harbor healthier neurons supported by a more naturalistic network of supporting glial cells, resulting in more functional neural connections and circuitry. Like the developing brain, the neurons form layers and talk with each other via neural networks. The spheroid technology is more consistent than earlier organoids in generating the same kinds of cortex-like structures in repeated experiments. The budding cortex also lends itself to analysis using conventional brain slice methods. So, in a sci-fi future, it might potentially reveal what circuits went awry in the developing cortex of a particular individual with a brain disorder.  While the technology is still maturing, there is great potential for using these assays to more accurately develop, test safety and effectiveness of new treatments before they are used in individuals with a mental illness,  said David Panchision, Ph.D., NIMH program director for stem cell research. What s next? Perhaps development of multiple neuron subtypes that normally populate the cortex, as well as long-distance connections between this cortex-like structure and other -- yet to be developed   organoid structures.","Published: May 29, 2015"

The TB-Profiler tool, developed by a team of scientists led by Dr Taane Clark at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, analyses and interprets genome sequence data to predict resistance to 11 drugs used for the treatment of TB. This rapid tool only takes a few minutes and means that sequence data can now be used without delay. Importantly, it also removes dependence on specialized bioinformatics skills that are not readily available in clinical settings. Data on how the tool works is published in open access journal Genome Medicine. Speeding up the process to find appropriate drugs when treating a patient with drug-resistant TB improves the likelihood of cure. By enabling the optimum course of treatment to be selected without delay, toxic drugs found to be ineffective because of resistance can be disregarded, relieving patients of damaging, unpleasant, and often long-lasting side effects. Researchers say the TB-Profiler tool will aid control of drug resistant TB, the emergence of which currently threatens to derail global efforts to control the disease. The World Health Organization estimates that 5% of the world s 11 million TB cases have multi drug-resistance disease (MDR-TB), with approximately 480,000 new MDR-TB cases and 210,000 deaths in 2013. The TB-Profiler was developed using global data and refers to a library of 1,325 mutations to M. tuberculosis (the bacteria that causes TB), making the tool the most comprehensive and accurate data source to date. Dr Taane Clark, Reader in Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Genomics, said:  Sequencing already assists patient management for a number of conditions such as HIV, but now that it is possible to sequence M. tuberculosis from sputum from suspected multi-drug resistance patients it means it has a role in the management of tuberculosis. We have developed a prototype to guide treatment of patients with drug resistant disease, where personalized medicine and treatment offers improved rates of cure.  Traditional lab-based methods of determining resistance involve growing the bacteria to see if it survives the drug, a process that can take weeks and sometimes months, and requires stringent safety measures to protect the laboratory personnel. The researchers highlight that their research demonstrates the potential of whole genome sequencing to increase the accuracy of molecular tests for resistance, with improved sensitivity and specificity. The tool also provides data on the genotype of the bacteria which can be used in epidemiological studies and by public health experts to track chains of disease transmission. Co-author Dr Ruth McNerney of TB Alert added:  This is a welcome step forward in our battle against drug resistance. It is now time to take sequencing out of the research lab and into the clinic. Patients with drug resistant disease have to endure many months of treatment with toxic drugs with no guarantee of success. Personalized treatment will increase their chances of survival while minimizing the horrible side effects. ","Published: May 29, 2015"

Many types of cancer, including colon and pancreatic, tend to metastasize to the liver. The earlier doctors can find these tumors, the more likely that they can successfully treat them.  There are interventions, like local surgery or local ablation, that physicians can perform if the spread of disease in the liver is confined, and because the liver can regenerate, these interventions are tolerated. New data are showing that those patients may have a higher survival rate, so there s a particular need for detecting early metastasis in the liver,  says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Using a harmless strain of E. coli that colonizes the liver, the researchers programmed the bacteria to produce a luminescent signal that can be detected with a simple urine test. Bhatia and Jeff Hasty, a professor of biology at UCSD, are the senior authors of a paper describing the new approach this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Lead authors are MIT postdoc Tal Danino and UCSD postdoc Arthur Prindle. Microbial helpPrevious studies had shown that bacteria can penetrate and grow in the tumor microenvironment, where there are lots of nutrients and the body s immune system is compromised. Because of this, scientists have been trying for many years to develop bacteria as a possible vehicle for cancer treatment. The MIT and UCSD researchers began exploring this idea a few years ago, but soon expanded their efforts to include the concept of creating a bacterial diagnostic. To turn bacteria into diagnostic devices, the researchers engineered the cells to express the gene for a naturally occurring enzyme called lacZ that cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose. In this case, lacZ acts on a molecule injected into the mice, consisting of galactose linked to luciferin, a luminescent protein naturally produced by fireflies. Luciferin is cleaved from galactose and excreted in the urine, where it can easily be detected using a common laboratory test. At first, the researchers were interested in developing these bacteria for injection into patients, but then decided to investigate the possibility of delivering the bacteria orally, just like the probiotic bacteria found in yogurt. To achieve that, they integrated their diagnostic circuits into a harmless strain of E. coli called Nissle 1917, which is marketed as a promoter of gastrointestinal health. In tests with mice, the researchers found that orally delivered bacteria do not accumulate in tumors all over the body, but they do predictably zero in on liver tumors because the hepatic portal vein carries them from the digestive tract to the liver.  We realized that if we gave a probiotic, we weren t going to be able to get bacteria concentrations high enough to colonize the tumors all over the body, but we hypothesized that if we had tumors in the liver they would get the highest dose from an oral delivery,  says Bhatia, who is a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. This allowed the team to develop a diagnostic specialized for liver tumors. In tests in mice with colon cancer that has spread to the liver, the probiotic bacteria colonized nearly 90 percent of the metastatic tumors. In the mouse experiments, animals that were given the engineered bacteria did not exhibit any harmful side effects. More sensitive detectionThe researchers focused on the liver not only because it is a natural target for these bacteria, but also because the liver is hard to image with conventional imaging techniques like CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), making it difficult to diagnose metastatic tumors there. With the new system, the researchers can detect liver tumors larger than about one cubic millimeter, offering more sensitivity than existing imaging methods. This kind of diagnostic could be most useful for monitoring patients after they have had a colon tumor removed because they are at risk for recurrence in the liver, Bhatia says. Andrea Califano, a professor of biological sciences at Columbia University, says the study is  seminal and thought-provoking in terms of clearing a new path for investigating what can be done for early detection of cancer,  adding that the therapeutic possibilities are also intriguing.  These bacteria could be engineered to cause genetic disruption of cancer cell function, deliver drugs, or reactivate the immune system,  says Califano, who was not involved in the research.

Research published in PLoS Computational Biology suggests that sleeping triggers the synapses in our brain to both strengthen and weaken, which prompts the forgetting, strengthening or modification of our memories in a process known as long-term potentiation (LTP). Researchers led by Sidarta Ribeiro at the Brain Institute of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, measured the levels of a protein related to LTP during the sleep cycle of rats. The authors then used the data to build models of sleep-dependent synaptic plasticity. The results show that sleep can have completely different effects depending on whether LTP is present or not. A lack of LTP leads to memory erasure, while the presence of LTP can either strengthen memories or prompt the emergence of new ones. The research provides an empirical and theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms underlying the complex role of sleep for learning, which involves selective remembering as well as creativity.

An international study led by The University of Queensland and Harvard Medical School has found that hearing voices and seeing things that others cannot see impacts about five per cent of the general population at some point in their lives. Queensland Brain Institute researcher Professor John McGrath said the study, involving more than 31,000 people from 19 countries, was the most comprehensive ever completed.  We used to think that only people with psychosis heard voices or had delusions, but now we know that otherwise healthy, high-functioning people also report these experiences,  Professor McGrath said.  Of those who have these experiences, a third only have them once and another third only have two-to-five episodes across their life. These people seem to function reasonably well.  So it s incredibly interesting that not only is hearing voices more common than previously thought, but it s not always linked to serious mental illness.  The study was a population-based survey which involved approaching randomly selected members of the community, sitting down with them and conducting a very detailed interview about their mental health.  These people were representative of the general population, not seeking mental health assistance,  Professor McGrath said. The study found that auditory hallucinations are more common in women than men, and they are also more common in people from wealthier countries. Professor McGrath said the findings could help generate new research into the causes of these isolated symptoms.  In particular, we are interested in learning why some people recover, while others may progress to more serious disorders such as schizophrenia,  he said.  We need to understand why it s temporary for some people and permanent for others. We can use these findings to start identifying whether the mechanisms causing these hallucinations are the same or different in both situations.  We need to rethink the link between hearing voices and mental health   it s more subtle than previously thought.  While people may experience a false perception such as mistakenly hearing their name called out in public, hallucinations and delusions are quite detailed, for example, hearing voices that no one else can hear or a belief that somebody else has taken over your mind.  People should be reassured that there isn t anything necessarily wrong with them if it happens once or twice, but if people are having regular experiences we recommend that they seek help.

The research describes the cellular and molecular basis behind some autistic behaviors; it also suggests potential biomarkers and pharmaceutical targets. Published in Cell Reports, the research was led by Zhen Yan, PhD, professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. The paper focuses on the loss of a gene called Shank3, an important risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The researchers trace how this risk factor disrupts communication between neurons, leading to social deficits in mice. And, in their most important finding, they are able to reverse these neuronal disruptions, restoring normal behavior in mice. Previous studies have shown that approximately 84 percent of people with a Shank3 deletion or loss-of-function mutation had an ASD. But just how this occurs has remained unknown. The paper states that mice with a Shank3 deficiency exhibited ""drastically reduced"" interest in social stimuli, i.e., other mice, versus inanimate objects, suggesting ""severe social deficits."" They also spent significantly more time in repetitive self-grooming than normal mice. The UB researchers found that the Shank3 deficiency plays a key role in how neurons communicate. It has a significant effect on the activation of the NMDA (n-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, which is critical to learning and memory. Yan explained that the Shank3 deficiency disrupts the trafficking of this receptor and its function at critical transmission sites in the brain. That disruption, they found, results from the dysregulation of actin filaments, which act as a kind of cellular ""highway"" in the brain's prefrontal cortex, the command center for ""high-level"" executive functions and a key region implicated in ASD. ""This research is the first to show that, in animals, abnormal actin regulation causes autism-like behaviors,"" said Yan. ""Actin filaments are very dynamic structures that are constantly being assembled and disassembled, processes controlled by numerous regulators,"" Yan explained. When something upsets the equilibrium of actin filament assembly, key cellular functions fall apart. ""With Shank3 deficiency, we have found that the expression or activity of some actin regulators, such as cofilin, is altered,"" explained Yan. ""This upsets the equilibrium of actin filament assembly, which, in turn, disrupts the normal delivery and maintenance of NMDA and other critical receptors."" The result is a very significant effect on the functional plasticity of the synapse, which, in turn, leads to the manifestation of some autistic behaviors. In its most dramatic finding, the researchers found they were able to reverse this process, restoring normal behaviors in the Shank3-deficient mice, once the activity of cofilin or other regulators was returned to normal. This, in turn, restored actin dynamics at cortical synapses, allowing for the normal trafficking and functioning of NMDA receptors. ""Once actin filaments and NMDA receptors returned to normal, we observed a robust and long-lasting rescue of the social interaction deficits and repetitive behavior in the Shank3-deficient mice,"" said Yan.

As for the brain s higher-level executive-control centers? Not so much. Investigators at Stanford University have found a surprising link between creative problem-solving and heightened activity in the cerebellum, a structure more typically thought of as the body s movement-coordination center. The cerebellum, traditionally viewed as the brain s practice-makes-perfect, movement-control center, hasn t been previously recognized as critical to creativity. The new study, a collaboration between the School of Medicine and Stanford s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, commonly known as the d.school, is the first to find direct evidence that this brain region is involved in the creative process.  Our findings represent an advance in our knowledge of the brain-based physiology of creativity,  said the study s senior author, Allan Reiss, MD, professor of radiology and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. The study, published in Scientific Reports, also suggests that shifting the brain s higher-level, executive-control centers into higher gear impairs, rather than enhances, creativity.  We found that activation of the brain s executive-control centers   the parts of the brain that enable you to plan, organize and manage your activities   is negatively associated with creative task performance,  said Reiss, who holds the Howard C. Robbins Professorship in Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences.  Creativity is an incredibly valued human attribute in every single human endeavor, be it work or play,  he continued.  In art, science and business, creativity is the engine that drives progress. As a practicing psychiatrist, I even see its importance to interpersonal relationships. People who can think creatively and flexibly frequently have the best outcomes.  The collaboration began about three and a half years ago when Grace Hawthorne, MFA, MBA, a consulting associate professor at the d.school who teaches a design-thinking skills course called  Creative Gym,  and one of her students approached Reiss, who has previously studied humor and other higher-level cognitive functions. They asked if he could objectively measure creativity, the better to confirm that Hawthorne s course can enhance it.  We didn t know that much about how to do that,  Reiss said.  So we decided to design a study that would give us baseline information on creativity s underlying neurophysiological processes.  As much as creativity may be in demand, it s not so easy to measure. At least 25 or 30 previous studies, mostly of professionally creative people such as jazz musicians and Emmy Award winners, have tried to look at neural correlates of creativity, said the study s lead author, Manish Saggar, PhD, an instructor in psychiatry and a member of the teaching team at the d.school.  Everybody wants to think creatively,  Saggar said.  But how do you get somebody to actually do that on command? Forcing people to think creatively may actually hamper creativity.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that subjects  brain processes are monitored while they re confined inside a dark, cramped MRI chamber. This environment is not exactly the first place that comes to mind when you re thinking about places where creativity can flower, Saggar said.  Creativity has to be measured in a fun environment,  he said.  Otherwise, you re bound to have anxiety and performance issues.  Saggar came up with the idea of borrowing an approach from Pictionary, a game in which players try to convey a word through drawing to help their teammates guess what the word is. He selected action words like  vote,   exhaust  and  salute.  Then he, Reiss and their colleagues serially tested 14 men and 16 women in an MRI chamber, recording activity throughout their brains via functional MRI scans while they drew either a word or, for comparison, a zigzag line, which required initiation and fine-motor control but not much creativity. Participants were given 30 seconds per word, long enough for a decent scan but short enough to elicit spontaneous improvisation and stave off boredom.  We didn t tell anyone,  Be creative!  We just told them,  Draw the word,  Reiss said. The drawings were captured on a special MRI-safe electronic tablet designed by study co-author Robert Dougherty, PhD, research director at the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging. The drawings were then sent to Hawthorne and Adam Royalty, a researcher at the d.school and co-author of the study. Hawthorne and Royalty separately rated the drawings on five-point scales of appropriateness   did it depict what it was supposed to?   and creativity   how many elements were in the drawing? How elaborate was it? How original? When they emerged from the MRI chamber, subjects were asked to rate the words they d been asked to draw for relative difficulty. Increasing subjective difficulty of drawing a word correlated with increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex, an executive-function center involved in attention and evaluation. But high creativity scores later assigned by the raters were associated with low activity in the executive-function center. Higher creativity scores were associated with higher activation in the cerebellum. On analysis, a number of brain areas were more active when subjects were engaged in drawing words than when they were drawing zigzag lines. Peak activation occurred in the cerebellum and regions of the cortex known to be involved in coordinating motor control or acting as a visual sketchpad. The latter regions  involvement in detailed drawing wasn't particularly surprising. But the heightened activity in the cerebellum was unexpected, as was its association with high creativity scores subsequently assigned by the raters. In monkeys, this brain region has been found to be especially active in learning and practicing new movements. But those monkey findings may have thrown researchers off, Saggar said. Newer studies show that, unlike the monkey cerebellum, the human cerebellum has robust connections not only to the motor cortex, the brain s higher movement-control center, but to the other parts of the cortex as well.  Anatomical and, now, functional evidence point to the cerebellum as doing much more than simply coordination of movement,  Saggar said. He and his colleagues speculate that the cerebellum may be able to model all new types of behavior as the more frontally located cortical regions make initial attempts to acquire those behaviors. The cerebellum then takes over and, in an iterative and subconscious manner, perfects the behavior, relieving the cortical areas of that burden and freeing them up for new challenges.  It s likely that the cerebellum is an important coordination center for the rest of brain, allowing other regions to be more efficient,  said Reiss.  As our study also shows, sometimes a deliberate attempt to be creative may not be the best way to optimize your creativity,  he said.  While greater effort to produce creative outcomes involves more activity of executive-control regions, you actually may have to reduce activity in those regions in order to achieve creative outcomes.  Saggar put it more bluntly.  The more you think about it, the more you mess it up,  he said. Stanford Medicine   Original reporting by: Bruce Goldman Reiss AL et al.

The procedure, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, involves placing sponge-covered electrodes on the head and passing a weak electrical current between them. It is widely regarded as safe, and the procedure is being studied as a treatment for depression and Alzheimer's-related memory loss, and to enhance recovery following strokes. David Schretlen, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, reasoned that this type of brain stimulation might ease some of the cognitive difficulties that afflict people with schizophrenia. ""Cognitive impairment is as ubiquitous as hallucinations in schizophrenia, yet medications only treat the hallucinations. So even with medication, affected individuals often remain very disabled,"" Schretlen says. His hope is that transcranial direct current stimulation could give people with schizophrenia a shot at leading a more normal life. To test that possibility, Schretlen and five Johns Hopkins colleagues targeted the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which plays an important role in short-term or working memory and is abnormal in people with schizophrenia. Interestingly, parents, siblings and children of people with schizophrenia show some of the same abnormalities to a lesser degree. Schretlen recruited 11 participants: five adults with confirmed schizophrenia and six of their close relatives. Each participant received two 30-minute treatments -- one using a negative electrical charge, which the researchers thought might prove beneficial -- and the other using a positive charge as a control. During and after each treatment, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests. On tests of verbal and visual working memory, participants performed significantly better after receiving a negative charge, and the effects were ""surprisingly strong,"" says Schretlen. Schretlen also tested participants' verbal fluency, or word retrieval, during the treatment. People with schizophrenia often struggle to find the right words, Schretlen explains. Because the prefrontal cortex contains a brain region responsible for word retrieval, Schretlen thought transcranial direct current stimulation might help. To test that theory, he gave participants a minute to list things they could buy in a supermarket. Most people taking the test rattle off items in categories, naming fruits, then vegetables, then dairy products, for example. Schretlen found that while participants did not rattle off more words, they did better at the challenging task of switching between categories after a negatively charged treatment. The stimulation ""was associated with better performance on working memory and subtle changes in word retrieval,"" Schretlen says. Schretlen is now studying transcranial direct current stimulation in a larger sample of patients using repeated sessions of stimulation, which he hopes will induce lasting benefits. ""What's nice about transcranial direct current stimulation is that it's so benign. There are no bad side effects,"" Schretlen says. ""If it enables people with schizophrenia to think more clearly, it would make a huge contribution to the treatment of this devastating illness."" Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release David J.

Among their tricks is to attack with a decoy force that occupies the defenders while an unseen force launches a separate attack that the defenders fail to notice. A recent study suggests that the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may employ similar tactics to distract the body's natural defenses. After infecting patients, Hepatitis C evolves many variants, among them an ""altruistic"" group of viral particles that appears to sacrifice itself to protect other mutants from the body's immune system. The findings, reported by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), could help guide development of future vaccines and treatments for the virus, which affects an estimated 170 million people in the world. Developing slowly over many years and often without symptoms, Hepatitis C can cause severe liver damage and cancer. There are currently no vaccines for the disease.  The members of viral populations in Hepatitis C don t act like separate entities; the different variants work together almost like a team,  said Leonid Bunimovich, a Regent s Professor in the Georgia Tech School of Mathematics.  There is a clear separation of responsibilities, including variants we call  altruistic  because they sacrifice themselves for the good of the whole viral population. These variants seem to draw the immune system attack on themselves.  The findings resulted from mathematical modeling done by the scientists, who first developed a model for how the virus variants and immune system antibodies interact. They then used the model to analyze and explain data gathered from a group of patients infected with Hepatitis C, some of whom had been followed for as long as 20 years. The virus evolves differently in each person, producing a mix of genetically-related variants over time, Bunimovich noted. Ultimately, the virus variants and the antibodies form a complex network in which an antibody to one variant can react to another variant a phenomenon known as cross-immunoreactivity. But how do viruses, which lack brains or even neural cells, produce a level of teamwork that s often difficult for humans to achieve?  The virus variants do not communicate directly with one another, but in this system of viruses and antibodies, they interact through the antibodies,  explained Bunimovich.  When one antibody-producing cell responds to one variant, and then to another, that is a form of interaction that affects both variants. An indirect interaction occurs when the virus variants interact with the same antibody in the network.  Unlike HIV to which it is often compared Hepatitis C virus doesn t suppress the body s immune system. Many scientists believe that the viral infection evolves like an  arms race,  with the virus mutating to stay one step ahead of the body s immune system. Using next-generation gene sequencing data, the research team which included regular fellow Pavel Skums and microbiologist Yury Khudyakov from the CDC s Division of Viral Hepatitis analyzed viral populations in detail. The scientists studied the genetic compositions of the populations, and even saw evolution in blood samples taken from the same persons over time. The populations of variants rose and fell, some remaining in small numbers and others reappearing after they had been seemingly wiped out by the immune system. At late stages of the persistent infection development, the evolution of new variations almost stopped, though the immune system remained strong. The  arms race  theory fails to explain these observations, Bunimovich said. Using their model to track both variants and antibodies, the researchers found that certain variants were drawing the immune system response on themselves to protect others. They called this newly-observed phenomenon  antigenic cooperation.  The antibodies suppressed only the altruistic variants, leaving other viral members of the network unharmed.  The altruistic variants allow the antibodies to attack them, thereby sacrificing themselves, so other variants can survive,  said Skums, the paper s first author.  The altruistic variants fool the immune system, rendering the immune system response to other variants ineffective. In essence, the surviving variants use the altruistic (sacrificing) variants as an umbrella to protect themselves.  The researchers were surprised by the sophisticated behavior, which occurs because the viral variants are part of the complex interconnected network a social network not unlike the ones created in such environments as Facebook.  Even such simple organisms as viruses can organize into a network,  Skums explained.  Because they are part of a network, they can develop this kind of complex behavior, fighting the immune system through team efforts.  The findings, if supported by additional research, could alter the strategy for developing vaccines for Hepatitis C. Both vaccines and treatment would have to take into account how the virus evolves differently in individuals. The researchers also hope to examine the activity of other viruses to see if this complex interaction may also be found in other viral networks, Bunimovich said. For the researchers, mathematics allowed them to see patterns that might otherwise have remained hidden in the complex patient data.  Now that we see this from the mathematical model, everything makes sense,  said Skums.  When you look at this mathematically, you can see the whole picture. ","Published: May 28, 2015"

The work is part of a larger NIH-funded project headed by Prof. Thomas D. Schmittgen and Prof. Mitch Phelps in the Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the university. The project aims are to engineer cells to manufacture extracellular vesicles that target the liver, in order to deliver a specific microRNA species capable of retarding the growth of tumor cells. Extracellular vesicles are released by almost all cell types. By transferring their molecular cargo, they have the potential to alter the function of recipient cells. The overall project includes the development of cell lines capable of producing large numbers of extracellular vesicles that have specific gene inclusions and a surface tag for targeting. NTA is being used to quantify extracellular vesicle particle numbers and yields in terms of their microRNA content and the presence of the surface markers. The ultimate aim of the project is to further the development of specific therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third most prevalent cancer in the world.  The Malvern NanoSight NTA system allows us to directly and reliably quantify extracellular vesicle yields from the cell lines under investigation, which is critical to this project,  said Dr Paulaitis.  We are also using the system to study the fusion of extracellular vesicles with synthetic nanoparticles, for the purpose of engineering the properties of the nanoparticles. We use a combination of the light scattering and fluorescence tracking functions of the NanoSight system to determine the proportion of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles that have bound to the extracellular vesicles. Having determined that we can quantify binding, the next step will be to scale up and apply NTA as a QC and process evaluation technique.  The Malvern NanoSight range of instruments uses Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis to characterize nanoparticles from 10 nm - 2000 nm in solution. Each particle is individually but simultaneously analyzed by direct observation and measurement of diffusion events. This particle-by-particle methodology produces high-resolution results for particle size distributions and concentrations, while visual validation provides users with additional confidence in their data. Both particle size and concentration are measured, while the fluorescence tracking mode can provide differentiation of labelled or naturally fluorescing particles.","Published: May 28, 2015"

This system of vessels nourishes the heart, enabling it to pump blood to all the other organs and tissues of the body. Yet despite their critical importance, the process and molecules required for coronary vessel development have not been fully determined. Studying zebrafish, investigators at The Saban Research Institute and the Heart Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles discovered a new source for cells that can develop into coronary vessels and have identified the signaling protein, a chemokine called CXCL12, which guides this process Zebrafish have emerged as an important vertebrate model for cardiovascular research for a number of reasons, including the ability to regenerate its heart if damaged, and because the transparency of the embryos allows easy observation of internal processes like blood vessel development. Using confocal and time-lapse imaging, the investigators were able to visualize coronary vessels developing from the endocardium, or the inner lining of the heart - specifically from the atrioventricular canal, the structure that divides the heart into compartments. ""This furthers our efforts into heart regeneration to repair human hearts,"" said Ching-Ling (Ellen) Lien, Ph.D., principal investigator at The Saban Research Institute of CHLA and senior author on the paper. ""We have now found a novel source of cells that can differentiate into coronary vessels and have identified the factors required."" Lien and her team observed that zebrafish with a mutation at the CXCR4 receptor survive, but are not able to form coronary vessels or undergo heart regeneration following injury. Since fish without this mutation are able to do both, the investigators concluded that an interaction between CXCR4 receptors on endothelial cells and the CXCL12b protein expressed by the myocardium regulate the process. In addition to providing basic information about the developing heart, this finding may also have clinical relevance. ""Children or young adults may not be aware of having abnormal coronary vessels because their circulation is adequate until the heart is stressed by increased demands, for instance when participating in strenuous sports,"" explains Lien, who is also an assistant professor at the Keck School of Medicine and an investigator at the Cardiovascular Thoracic Institute, both at the University of Southern California. ""Then suddenly, an apparently healthy, young person dies. Alternatively, a person with abnormal coronary vessels might have higher risk of experiencing heart attacks later on in life.

Translational funding is paramount to accelerating concept to commercialisation, bridging the gap between basic science and its application.  Such grants will allow scientists at Norwich Research Park to utilise their intellectual assets that lead to successful commercial and societal impact on a local and national scale. Growing the potential for not only knowledge but also new techniques, products and ventures, which can help sustain UK productivity and economic prosperity.  Fa ade: an Open Source library for visual exploration of genomic data TGAC, in collaboration with Repositive.io, develop an open source toolset for visual exploration of genomics data for clinical research. Without new tools that dramatically increase the efficiency of genomics applied informatics, the annual costs associated with analysis and interpretation of biological data will increase significantly from 35% of costs in 2012 to 55% of costs in 2020.1  With the biotech market expected to have an annual growth of 22.7% from 2012 to 2018 and to reach $580 million2, there is an increasing commercial need for informatics tools that facilitate access to the analysis of large genome data sets for research and clinical use. Governments around the world are making DNA sequencing part of their mainstream healthcare by launching large population sequencing projects. In parallel, research and pharmaceutical organisations are generating a vast amount of data and collaborations around managing and analysing wide-reaching studies. The gap between the high production of data and its interpretation in genomics research requires efficient visualisation tools to allow clinicians and researchers to identify the genetic causes of diseases and traits.  Fa ade, an open source web interface coupled to visualise genomic data from the Repositive.io platform, will directly address this growing commercial demand in the research community by enabling visual exploration solutions for genomics, supporting those that lack resources to leverage vast amounts of data.1 The tool s design will allow for easy configuration to connect with other data sources of either public or private data.  Facilitating user-driven queries that indicate genomic markers to help diagnose genetic diseases, the bioinformatics software will enable clinicians and researchers to explore genome data in a visual and interactive manner without writing complex queries or programming code.  Manuel Corpas, project lead and Project Leader at TGAC, said:  We expect Fa ade to make a significant impact in the way clinicians and researchers interact with heterogeneous and distributed sources of genomic data in an intuitive way.  Multi-functional data integration software tool to improve metadata and network analysis efficiency TGAC, in collaboration with the Institute of Food Research (IFR), develops a novel software that provides a comprehensive systems biology platform for the integration of diverse datasets. The bespoke Omix Navigator will be available from spring 2016. In bioscience, thousands of new biological datasets and resources are published on an annual basis. Evaluation and integrated work with these systematic resources are difficult as many of the datasets are stored in different formats. Around 70 per cent of data-driven projects now involve managing data for integration, transforming, and cleansing even before the actual analysis starts.  Integration of diverse data types such as disease, genomic, proteomic or transcriptomic datasets is an extremely time and resource consuming. Omics-specific tools, like Galaxy, ELM, Expasy are efficient in focusing on one data type but cannot help the users to work on the necessary, multi-scale level and combine different omics datasets. For metadata analysis, it is necessary to provide tools that enable an all-in-one biological system. OmiX Navigator, works as a cloud-based web service, will include advanced visualisation, multi-layered databases, data integration and evaluation solutions, as well as network analytical tools and workflow management platforms.  Project Lead Tam s Korcsm ros, Computational Biology Fellow at The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) and Research Leader at IFR, said:  Researchers with wet lab backgrounds have different biological questions, but in most cases, the computational methods to help investigating a scientific problem and to guide the experiments are very similar.  However, the available software solutions do not allow to the straightforward analysis of complex biological questions, such as host-pathogen interactions, systems-level changes between different livestock trait and genome-wide analysis of inflammatory diseases in human.   With Omix Navigator, we will provide an easy-to-use, plug & play like software for colleagues to facilitate systems biology related projects. I am very excited to work on this project with the excellent computational biologist colleagues at TGAC and wet lab researchers at IFR to develop the Omix Navigator in the Norwich Research Park.  The OmiX Navigator prototype will be tailored to its target markets including research institutions, Contract Research Organisations (CROs) and SMEs in the biotech sector; available from March 2016. New tool suggests candidate molecules to speed-up drug discovery TGAC, in collaboration with IFR, aims to develop a bioinformatics software that will predict active compounds for drug advancement for personalised medicine.  NaLeSST (Natural Lead Structure Suggestion Tool) will be a valuable tool in accelerating the drug discovery process, with the potential for commercial applications in the era of personalised medicine to fight complex diseases and resistant bacteria. Although multiple computational biology approaches are used in rational drug design, the current tools present a number of challenges such as chemical libraries containing molecules that are too different in structure from natural products; inefficient library search; extensive manual work in the drug development pipelines; and unexpected subsequent toxicity and adverse drug responses. As it progresses, the project will benefit from incorporating existing knowledge and data acquired by high-throughput genomic techniques, including evidences gained in health-related projects across the Norwich Research Park. Co-Project Lead Wiktor Jurkowski and Group Leader of Integrative Genomics at TGAC, said:  The idea of NaLeSST was fuelled by our experience in cheminformatics molecular modelling and shared interest to unravel the potential of natural compounds.  New routes of discovery are urgently needed. Currently, there are no specialised resources to facilitate the pathway to hitting drug targets by leading development focusing on natural compounds.   We believe that such a resource would become a choice tool for companies dealing with early stage drug research and development, in particular, searching for new routes to identify active leads. For any target molecule, NaLeSST can automatically suggest potential lead structures as starting points for corresponding drug development, cutting short the dominating costly expert-driven research.   We observed over the last decade, a decrease of new chemical entities being introduced to the market. We believe that our research can contribute to revert this trend.  TGAC is strategically funded by BBSRC and operates a National Capability to promote the application of genomics and bioinformatics to advance bioscience research and innovation.","Published: May 28, 2015"

The paper, entitled 'Reproductive workers show queen-like gene expression in an intermediately eusocial insect, the buff-tailed bumble bee Bombus terrestris', suggests that the development of an individual bumblebee into its designated caste of male, worker or queen depends on the activation of individual genes, despite the bees all sharing similar genomes. The study is part of student Mark Harrison's Ph.D. thesis and was supervised by Drs Eamonn Mallon and Rob Hammond from the University of Leicester's Department of Biology. It is the first time the whole genome exploration of caste differentiation has been carried out for the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, which is now possible due to the recent sequencing of the entire bumblebee genome. Mark Harrison explained: ""The bumblebee is one of the most ecologically and economically important pollinators. One fascinating aspect of its biology is the differentiation of developing females into either workers or queens. ""In our study we had the aim to understand how one genome could produce three such different castes - queens, workers and males - within bumblebees. ""The question we sought to answer is how the genome encodes for males, workers and queens, as they are so genetically similar yet so different in behavior, morphology and physiology."" The team analyzed which genes were 'turned on' in males, workers and queens of the buff-tailed bumblebee at different developmental stages to understand how the same genomes can produce such different castes. The findings suggest that differentiation is not caused by inherited genetic difference, as is typical of most species of animal, meaning that males, which hatch from unfertilized eggs, are genetically very similar to their sisters. Mark added: ""One interesting finding was that the largest differences in gene expression were detected between adult castes rather than between castes within larval or pupal stages. This is surprising since all morphological features are developed during these two developmental phases. ""This indicates the need for more distinct expression patterns to control behavior and physiology in adults compared to those required to create different morphologies. ""This was further highlighted by the patterns we observed within adult castes. The largest difference was found between the queen and males, whose behavior and physiology show little overlap."" The differentiation between the castes in bees is similar to cell differentiation in humans, who also have a single genome encoded for all cell types. Each cell in the human body contains identical DNA, yet they differentiate into very different cell types, such as liver cells or neurons. Queens and the reproductive workers, which begin laying eggs towards the end of a colony cycle, also showed little difference in their gene expression patterns. Reproductive workers appear to become more 'queen-like' in their behaviour and physiology. In the future, the researchers hope to find out whether or not a different version of the same gene can lead to a female developing into a queen rather than a worker and wish to better understand how expression patterns are inherited in animals.","Published: May 28, 2015"

An international team of scientists say they have cataloged a comprehensive map of those mutations in metastatic prostate cancers. Their findings are a  Rosetta Stone  to breakthrough treatments of the disease, they claim.  We have for the first time produced a comprehensive genetic map of the mutations in prostate cancers that have spread round the body,  said Johann de Bono, professor of Experimental Cancer Medicine at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, in a statement.  This map will guide our future treatment and trials for this group of different lethal diseases.  The genetic codes of roughly 150 patients  metastatic tumors were analyzed, from the bone, soft tissues, lymph nodes and livers, the researchers said. Two-third of those tumors had mutations in a particular molecule interacting with the hormone androgen   potentially opening up immediate new hormonal treatments, they said. But they also found that BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes   which can play a huge role in certain deadly breast cancers   were found in about 20 percent of the prostate patients. And other mutations that had been seen in other cancers were found for the first time in prostate cancer, they said. Those included the PI3K and RAF genes, which are currently targeted by other drugs, they said.  This major new study opens up the black box of metastatic cancer, and has found inside a wealth of genetic information that I believe will change the way we think about and treat advanced disease,  said Paul Workman, chief executive and president of The Institute of Cancer Research. A new genetic test for prostate-cancer risk was unveiled at the American Urology Association conference early this week. SNP Bio, its developer, says it analyzes 33 of the most-common genetic markers for aggressive forms of the disease   and could make sure that early detection is provided to those most prone to the disease. The National Cancer Institute has identified several dozen genetic markers for the disease. The American Cancer Society has called for better genetic testing to target certain patients   especially to improve surveillance on those likely to develop aggressive tumors. According to the Society, the PSA screening process has dramatically decreased the rate of metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis over the last 20 years.","Published: May 28, 2015"

Until now, however, production of these artificial structures has been limited to water-based environments, because DNA naturally functions inside the watery environment of living cells. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have now shown that they can assemble DNA nanostructures in a solvent containing no water. They also discovered that adding a small amount of water to their solvent increases the assembly rate and provides a new means for controlling the process. The solvent may also facilitate the production of more complex structures by reducing the problem of DNA becoming trapped in unintended structures. The research could open up new applications for DNA nanotechnology, and help apply DNA technology to the fabrication of nanoscale semiconductor and plasmonic structures.   DNA nanotechnology structures are getting more and more complex, and this solvent could help researchers that are working in this growing field,  said Nicholas Hud, a professor in Georgia Tech s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  With this work, we have shown that DNA nanostructures can be assembled in a water-free solvent, and that we can mix water with the same solvent to speed up the assembly. We can also take the structures that were assembled in this solvent mixed with water  remove the water by applying vacuum   and have the DNA structures remain intact in the water-free solvent.  The assembly rate of DNA nanostructures can be very slow, and depends strongly on temperature. Raising the temperature increases this rate, but temperatures that are too high can cause the DNA structures to fall apart. The solvent system developed at Georgia Tech adds a new level of control over DNA assembly. DNA structures assemble at lower temperatures in this solvent, and adding water can adjust the solvent s viscosity, which allows for faster assembly compared to the water-free version of the solvent.  This solvent changes the rules,  said Isaac G llego, a postdoctoral researcher in Hud s lab and the paper s first author.  We now have a tool that controls DNA assembly kinetics and thermodynamics all in one solvent. This solvent also offers enhanced properties for nanotechnology and for the stability of these nanomaterials in solution.  G llego had worked in DNA nanotechnology before coming to Georgia Tech, and was convinced that alternative solvents could advance this field. At Georgia Tech he evaluated new solvents for use with DNA nanostructures, solvents that had been designed for other purposes. One solvent he tested, called glycholine that is a mixture of glycerol and choline chloride, allowed a two-dimensional DNA origami structure to assemble in six days at a temperature of 20 C. Not only did the glycholine assemble the DNA structure at a relatively low temperature, but it also avoided  kinetic traps,  intermediate structures that are stable, but not the desired structure, G llego said. Structures that fail to completely assemble are a major source of low yields in the DNA nanofabrication process.  This solvent could provide a new tool to make more complicated designs with DNA because you can avoid trapping these complex structures at intermediate steps,  he added.  Kinetic traps are among the bottlenecks for producing more complicated DNA nanostructures.  Glycholine is miscible in water, so it can be mixed in any ratio with water to control the kinetics of the assembly process. For instance, one structure that assembles in six days in pure solvent will assemble in three hours in a glycholine solution containing 10 percent water. A key feature of the new solvent system is that it does not require changes to existing DNA nanotechnology designs that were developed for water.  You can go back and forth between hydrated and non-hydrated states,  said G llego.  This solvent system preserves the DNA structures that have been developed to work in water.  The solvent system could improve the combined use of metallic nanoparticles and DNA based materials. In the typical aqueous solvents where DNA nanotechnology is performed, nanoparticles are prone to aggregation. The solvent s low volatility could also allow storage of assembled DNA structures without the concern that a water-based medium would dry out. The research team, which also included Martha Grover from Georgia Tech s School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, has so far used the solvent to assemble three structures, including two DNA origami structures. In future work, they hope to use the control provided by water-free solvents to obtain dynamic DNA structural rearrangements that are not possible in water, and investigate other solvents that may have additional properties attractive for nanotechnology applications.  We were confident all along that we would find a solvent that would be compatible with existing DNA nanotechnology,  added Hud, who is also director of the NSF-NASA Center for Chemical Evolution and associate director of the Parker H. Petit Institute of Bioengineering and Bioscience, both at Georgia Tech.  What was surprising was finding a solvent that allows the assembly of structures more easily than in water. That was completely unexpected because DNA nanotechnology was developed in water.  The research on water-free solvents grew out of Georgia Tech research into the origins of life. Hud and colleagues had wondered if the molecules necessary for life, such as the ancestor of DNA, could have developed in a water-free solution. In some cases, he noted, the chemistry necessary to make the molecules of life would be much easier without water being present.  This work was inspired by research into the origins of life with the basic question of whether complex DNA structures could exist in non-aqueous solvents, and we showed that they can,  said Hud.  And what we ve found working with these new solvents could help answer some questions about the origins of life, while also having applications in nanotechnology. ","Published: May 28, 2015"

In addition, a paper in Clinical Cancer Research described preclinical findings relating to the company s pan-HER product candidate, Sym013, a mixture of six antibodies targeting each of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 with a pair of synergistic antibodies. This body of evidence represents strong mechanistic validation for Symphogen s novel and pioneering antibody mixture approach to innovative oncology therapeutics. The clinical efficacy data published provided the basis for advancing Sym004 into a randomized Phase 2b study, currently ongoing in the USA and Europe. In the June issue of Cancer Discovery (Cancer Discovery; 5(6)), Dienstmann et al. report for the first time positive efficacy clinical findings for Sym004 s study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapies. According to Josep Tabernero, MD, Principal Investigator for the study, who is affiliated with the Vall D Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain,  Sym004 is a unique antibody mixture that double targets EGFR, and as a result, appears to cause superior EGFR internalization and degradation than we ve seen with cetuximab or panitumumab. Given this advantage, we believe the novel mixture will ultimately provide better outcomes for patients than drugs that block EGFR at only one region of it extracellular domain.  The Phase 1 study enrolled a total of 62 patients; of which 20 patients had advanced solid epithelial tumors and were enrolled to the dose-escalation phase of the study. They received different doses of Sym004, ranging from 0.4 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, administered weekly. The remaining 42 enrolled patients had metastatic colorectal cancer and had previously been treated with anti-EGFR antibodies with brief responses, and were enrolled to the dose-expansion phase of the trial. Patients in the dose-expansion cohort received weekly doses of 9 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg of Sym004. Of the patients in the dose-expansion cohort, five (13 percent) had a partial response, and overall, 17 (44 percent) had some degree of tumor shrinkage during treatment with Sym004. The overall disease-control rate, which includes partial responses and stable disease, was 67 percent. Dr. Tabernero commented, ""We ve not previously seen results such as those we are reporting in a patient population of anti-EGFR antibody-resistant colorectal cancer. Importantly, the study is the culmination of diligent research in preclinical models that has now translated to clinical activity. Importantly, the significant antitumor activity of Sym004 in patients whose tumors have become resistant to anti-EGFR therapies suggests that some colorectal cancers that progress after treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab, both anti-EGFR therapies, remain dependent on EGFR signaling."" In the paper, Tabernero said that Sym004 was found to be well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. Specifically, he pointed to a toxicity profile that is consistent with other approved anti-EGFR antibodies (grade 3 skin toxicity and low magnesium levels, among others), and observed that these effects were controlled with supportive care (topical and systemic antibiotics, and steroids), dose delays, and dose reductions. Ivan Horak, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of Symphogen, added,  Sym004 has demonstrated the ability to not only block ligand binding, receptor activation and downstream signaling but also to elicit removal of the EGFR receptors from the cancer cell surface by inducing EGFR internalization and degradation. Clearly, these data suggest these mechanisms are working and hold great promise for the future. By removing receptor tyrosine kinase receptors from cancer cells, we believe we have identified an effective therapeutic strategy for patients resistant to anti-EGFR antibodies, and which may also provide a better outcome for patients na ve to therapy than that provided by currently approved EGFR antibodies.  In Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology (Machiels et al.), Symphogen also reported data from a proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial of Sym004 in patients with late-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). After studying the efficacy and tolerability of the novel antibody mixture, the company said it observed a best overall response of stable disease in 13 of 26 patients, and down-regulation of EGFR in target skin and tumor tissues, supporting the proposed hypothesis of the Sym004 s mechanism of action. In the extensively pretreated advanced SSCHN patients studied, the trial revealed modest anti-tumor activity. The safety of the mixture was found to be consistent with prior studies  findings of adverse events related to EGFR, and no anti-drug antibodies were detected. Separately, Symphogen reported also in April, in Clinical Cancer Research, preclinical findings from the company s Pan-HER program showing that Pan-HER overcomes primary and acquired resistance due to HER family expression heterogeneity and plasticity. According to Symphogen, this data supports advancing the program into clinic in patients with HER family-dependent tumors.","Published: May 28, 2015"

Throughout billions of years of existence on Earth, these tiny units of life have evolved to collaborate at the smallest levels in promoting, preserving and protecting the organism they comprise. Among these functions is the transport of lipids and other biomacromolecules between cells via membrane adhesion and fusion processes that occur in many biological functions, including waste transport, egg fertilization and digestion. At the Univ. of California, Santa Barbara, chemical engineers have developed a way to directly observe both the forces present and the behavior that occurs during cell hemifusion, a process by which only the outer layers of the lipid bilayer of cell membranes merge. While many different techniques have been used to observe membrane hemifusion, simultaneous measurements of membrane thickness and interaction forces present a greater challenge, according to Dong Woog Lee, lead author of a paper.  It is hard to simultaneously image hemifusion and measure membrane thickness and interaction forces due to the technical limitations,  he said. However, by combining the capabilities of the Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) a device that can measure the tiny forces generated by the interaction of two surfaces at the sub-nano scale and simultaneous imaging using a fluorescence microscope, the researchers were able to see in real time how the cell membranes rearrange in order to connect and open a fusion conduit between them. The SFA was developed in Prof. Jacob Israelachvili s Interfacial Sciences Lab at UCSB. Israelachvili is a faculty member in the Dept. of Chemical Engineering at UCSB. To capture real time data on the behavior of cell membranes during hemifusion, the researchers pressed together two supported lipid bilayers on the opposing surfaces of the SFA. These bilayers consisted of lipid domains collections of lipids that in non-fusion circumstances are organized in more or less regularly occurring or mixed arrangements within the cell membrane.  We monitored these lipid domains to see how they reorganize and relocate during hemifusion,  said Lee. The SFA measured the forces and distances between the two membrane surfaces as they were pushed together, visualized at the  ngstrom (one tenth of a nanometer) level. Meanwhile, fluorescent imaging made it possible to see the action as the more ordered-phase (more solid) domains reorganized and allowed the more disordered-phase (more fluid) domains to concentrate at the point of contact.  This is the first time observing fluorescent images during a hemifusion process simultaneously with how the combined thickness of the two bilayers evolve to form a single layer,  said Lee This rearrangement of the domains, he added, lowers the amount of energy needed during the many processes that require membrane fusion. At higher pressures, according to the study, the extra energy activates faster hemifusion of the lipid layers. Lipid domains have been seen in many biological cell membranes, and have been linked to various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer s disease, and lung diseases. According to the researchers, this novel device could be used to diagnose, provide a marker for, or study dynamic transformations in situations involving lipid domains in pathological membranes. The fundamental insights provided by this device could also prove useful for other materials in which dynamic changes occur between membranes, including surfactant monolayers and bilayers, biomolecules, colloidal particles, surfactant-coated nanoparticles and smart materials.","Published: May 28, 2015"

The trial was led in the UK by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 64 research centres worldwide, including the University of Oxford. Researchers randomised 436 patients with aggressive, inoperable malignant melanoma to receive either an injection of the viral therapy, called Talimogene Laherparepvec, or a control immunotherapy. Some 16.3% of the group given Talimogene Laherparepvec   known as T-VEC   showed a durable treatment response of more than six months, compared with 2.1% given the control treatment. Some patients had a response extending past three years, a mark oncologists often use as a proxy for cure in immunotherapy. Importantly, responses to treatment were most pronounced in patients with less advanced cancers (stage IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a) and those who had yet to receive any treatment   underlining the potential benefits of T-VEC as a first-line treatment for metastatic melanoma which cannot be surgically removed. Patients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC   a total of 163 people   lived an average of 41 months. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control immunotherapy. The trial was funded by the manufacturer of T-VEC, Amgen, and is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. T-VEC is a modified form of herpes simplex virus type-1 which multiplies inside cancer cells and bursts them from within. It has been genetically engineered to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which stimulates the immune system to attack and destroy the tumour. T-VEC is one of a new wave of virus-based drugs to show benefits in cancer trials, and is now the first to do so in a major randomised, controlled Phase III trial. The virus has been modified to remove two key genes, called ICP34.5 and ICP47, so that it can t replicate within healthy cells. Normal cells detect and destroy T-VEC before it can cause damage   but it replicates easily in cancer cells because their infection defences are compromised by genetic errors. UK trial leader Professor Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at the ICR and Honorary Consultant at The Royal Marsden, said:  There is increasing excitement over the use of viral treatments like T-VEC for cancer, because they can launch a two-pronged attack on tumours   both killing cancer cells directly and marshalling the immune system against them. And because viral treatment can target cancer cells specifically, it tends to have fewer side-effects than traditional chemotherapy or some of the other new immunotherapies.  Our study showed that T-VEC can deliver a significant, durable benefit for people with melanoma. It is encouraging that the treatment had such a clear benefit for patients with less advanced cancers   ongoing studies are evaluating if it can become a first-line treatment for more aggressive melanomas and advanced disease.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of the ICR, said:  We may normally think of viruses as the enemies of mankind, but it s their very ability to specifically infect and kill human cells that can make them such promising cancer treatments. ""In this case we are harnessing the ability of an engineered virus to kill cancer cells and stimulate an immune response. It s exciting to see the potential of viral treatment realised in a Phase III trial, and there is hope that therapies like this could be even more effective when combined with targeted cancer drugs to achieve long term control and cure.

They use a number of dirty tricks to survive and infiltrate the body. Now Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) scientists are fighting back with some sneaky strategies of their own. A study published in Cancer Discovery describes how Jan Kitajewski, PhD, and colleagues have created new decoy drugs that can intercept the deceptive growth signals that cancer cells send out. As tumors grow, they consume increasing amounts of oxygen and nutrients. Eventually cancer cells need their own blood supply, and release signals that interact with the lining of existing blood vessels, in effect putting out a call for new vessel growth. This process, called angiogenesis, involves switches that direct how and where the vessels are formed. To prevent cancers from co-opting the blood supply, scientists have created drugs that block some of these switches, including an important one called Notch. Notch plays a key role in angiogenesis and contributes to the progression of many different types of cancers. There s a significant problem with Notch-targeted drugs, however: like many chemotherapy treatments, they are blunt weapons. Turning off Notch may slow cancer growth at one site, but can cause problems for many other kinds of cells that rely on Notch to control normal processes. As a result, current Notch-targeted drugs provoke a range of significant side effects including intestinal and liver toxicity. To mitigate these problems, doctors have to give patients complex drug cocktails. Dr. Kitajewski s team at CUMC may have devised a more effective strategy. Instead of trying to block Notch outright, the lab has engineered molecules that mimic part of the switch, preventing certain types of signals from activating it. These molecules act as decoys, jamming signals at the surface of blood vessel cells, and interfere with tumor angiogenesis. In tests on mice with different types of cancer, these decoy drugs caused only moderate toxicity compared with Notch-blocking treatments. Why the improvement? The decoys interfere with the signals that are more prevalent in tumors, but they don t block the entire switch. As a result, Notch can continue to communicate in normal tissues as needed.  Scientists can now design drugs more strategically because we are learning so much about the complex molecular details behind a cancer s growth,  said Dr. Kitajewski, who is a professor of Obstetrics & Gynecology at CUMC.  As a result, future drugs will be able to target cancer sites with greater precision and with fewer side effects.  His lab will continue to improve the design of the decoy drugs before it moves on to testing them in clinical trials.","Published: May 28, 2015"

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/starting-antiretroviral-treatment-early-improves-outcomes-for-hivinfected-individuals-210061,Starting Antiretroviral Treatment Early Improves Outcomes for HIV infected Individuals NIH funded trial results likely will impact global treatment guidelines  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A major international randomized clinical trial has found that HIV-infected individuals have a considerably lower risk of developing AIDS or other serious illnesses if they start taking antiretroviral drugs sooner, when their CD4+ T-cell count-a key measure of immune system health-is higher, instead of waiting until the CD4+ cell count drops to lower levels. Together with data from previous studies showing that antiretroviral treatment reduced the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected sexual partners, these findings support offering treatment to everyone with HIV. The new finding is from the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study, the first large-scale randomized clinical trial to establish that earlier antiretroviral treatment benefits all HIV-infected individuals. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, provided primary funding for the START trial. Though the study was expected to conclude at the end of 2016, an interim review of the study data by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended that results be released early.  We now have clear-cut proof that it is of significantly greater health benefit to an HIV-infected person to start antiretroviral therapy sooner rather than later,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  Moreover, early therapy conveys a double benefit, not only improving the health of individuals but at the same time, by lowering their viral load, reducing the risk they will transmit HIV to others. These findings have global implications for the treatment of HIV.   This is an important milestone in HIV research,  said Jens Lundgren, M.D., of the University of Copenhagen and one of the co-chairs of the START study.  We now have strong evidence that early treatment is beneficial to the HIV-positive person. These results support treating everyone irrespective of CD4+ T-cell count.  The START study, which opened widely in March 2011, was conducted by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT) at 215 sites in 35 countries. The trial enrolled 4,685 HIV-infected men and women ages 18 and older, with a median age of 36. Participants had never taken antiretroviral therapy and were enrolled with CD4+ cell counts in the normal range - above 500 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm3). Approximately half of the study participants were randomized to initiate antiretroviral treatment immediately (early treatment), and the other half were randomized to defer treatment until their CD4+ cell count declined to 350 cells/mm3. On average, participants in the study were followed for three years. The study measured a combination of outcomes that included serious AIDS events (such as AIDS-related cancer), serious non-AIDS events (major cardiovascular, renal and liver disease and cancer), and death. Based on data from March 2015, the DSMB found 41 instances of AIDS, serious non-AIDS events or death among those enrolled in the study s early treatment group compared to 86 events in the deferred treatment group. The DSMB s interim analysis found risk of developing serious illness or death was reduced by 53 percent among those in the early treatment group, compared to those in the deferred group. Rates of serious AIDS-related events and serious non-AIDS-related events were both lower in the early treatment group than the deferred treatment group. The risk reduction was more pronounced for the AIDS-related events. Findings were consistent across geographic regions, and the benefits of early treatment were similar for participants from low- and middle-income countries and participants from high-income countries.  The study was rigorous and the results are clear,  said INSIGHT principal investigator James D. Neaton, Ph.D., a professor of biostatistics at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.  The definitive findings from a randomized trial like START are likely to influence how care is delivered to millions of HIV-positive individuals around the world.  The University of Minnesota served as the trial s regulatory sponsor and statistical and data management center. Prior to the START trial, there was no randomized controlled trial evidence to guide initiating treatment for individuals with higher CD4+ cell counts. Previous evidence to support early treatment among HIV-positive people with CD4+ cell counts above 350 was limited to data from non-randomized trials or observational cohort studies, and on expert opinion. START is the first large-scale randomized clinical trial to offer concrete scientific evidence to support the current U.S. HIV treatment guidelines, which recommend that all asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals take antiretrovirals, regardless of CD4+ cell count. Current World Health Organization HIV treatment guidelines recommend that HIV-infected individuals begin antiretroviral therapy when CD4+ cell counts fall to 500 cells/mm3 or less. In light of the DSMB findings, study investigators are informing all participants of the interim results. Participants will be offered treatment if they are not already on antiretroviral therapy, and they will continue to be followed through 2016. The HIV medicines used in the trial are approved medications donated by AbbVie, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline/ViiV Healthcare, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. In addition to NIAID, funding for the START trial came from other NIH entities, including the National Cancer Institute; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; the National Institute of Mental Health; the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; the NIH Clinical Center; and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

Mutations in the gene DCDC2 have previously been associated with dyslexia, and this study found that dyslexics with an altered copy of the gene are unable to detect certain types of visual motion. In the study, the researchers used a series of visual tests to compare typical readers with two groups of dyslexics   one with and one without a specific deletion in the DCDC2 gene. The subjects were presented with images of patterned black and white lines and asked to determine whether the image was moving horizontally or vertically. Dyslexics with the genetic deletion failed to detect the motion of the image, although they were able to determine the orientation of the lines. The group of dyslexics with a normal copy of the DCDC2 performed similarly to the normal readers, with only a minor impairment in motion detection.

Specifically, females without autism have a slightly higher level of RORA in the frontal cortex of the brain than males without autism, while the levels of the protein are comparably lower in the brain of both males and females with autism. The new study, published this month by Molecular Autism in a special issue on sex differences in autism, further shows a stronger correlation between the expression level of RORA and that of genes regulated by RORA in males. This finding suggests males may be more susceptible than females to dysregulation of multiple genes under conditions of RORA deficiency. ""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, males are nearly four times more likely than females to have autism, but the reason for this sex bias is still a mystery,"" said Hu, professor of biochemistry and molecular medicine at the GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences. ""Our research suggests that deficiencies in RORA expression in the brain may have a greater impact on males, which may contribute to the known sex bias in autism in several ways."" In previous studies, Hu and her group reported that RORA is a novel candidate gene for autism and is regulated in opposite directions by male and female hormones. They later showed that RORA, a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a transcription factor, can potentially regulate the transcription of more than 2,500 genes, including over 400 genes already associated with autism. This finding suggests a domino effect in which RORA deficiency can impact many autism genes. Among the genes they validated as transcriptional targets of RORA is the gene for aromatase, an enzyme that converts male to female hormones. Thus, RORA deficiency is linked to aromatase deficiency, which in turn can lead to elevated testosterone levels, a proposed risk factor for autism. Using a genetically identical mouse model to reduce the contribution of genetic heterogeneity to gene expression that is typical for humans, the group observed a two-fold higher level of RORA expression in the frontal cortex of female mice in comparison to male mice. Moreover, the correlation between RORA and target gene expression in the cortex is much higher in male mice. They also found a strong positive correlation between the levels of RORA and aromatase proteins in the frontal cortex of human males and females without autism spectrum disorder and of males with autism spectrum disorder. However, this strong correlation between RORA and aromatase levels was not observed in females with autism spectrum disorder, suggesting that they may have compensatory mechanisms for regulating RORA target genes to offset RORA deficiency. ""Overall, this study suggests that RORA deficiency may have a greater impact on males, not only because males have lower baseline levels of RORA in the brain to start with, but also because the expression of autism-associated genes may be more highly correlated with the lower expression of RORA in males,"" said Hu.

""Alzheimer's is a gray matter disease,"" said Federica Agosta, M.D., Ph.D., co-author of the study conducted at the Neuroimaging Research Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy. ""However, white matter damage has a central role in how the disease strikes and progresses."" AD is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease is characterized by abnormal deposits of proteins that form amyloid plaques and tau tangles throughout the brain and a loss of neurons that causes brain tissue to shrink over time. Where or how the disease begins is not completely understood. Study leader Massimo Filippi, M.D., and his team of researchers used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess the white matter tracts in 53 patients with three types of AD: early-onset AD and two atypical types of AD called focal syndromes because they affect localized parts of the brain. Unlike late-onset AD that occurs after age 65 and is characterized primarily by progressive memory loss, patients with early-onset AD have impairment in several regions of the brain, including deficits in executive functioning and visuospatial abilities. Focal AD syndromes may cause visual disturbances or language deficits. DTI, a specialized magnetic resonance imaging technique that uses the movement of water molecules to characterize the microstructure of biological tissues, is highly sensitive to white matter degeneration. ""Our goal was to use DTI to identify similarities and differences in white tract damage across the AD spectrum and in relation to patterns of cortical atrophy,"" Dr. Agosta said.The researchers' analysis of the images revealed that all of the patients had extensive white matter damage, and showed regional gray matter damage. ""The white matter damage in patients with focal AD syndromes was much more severe and widespread than expected and cannot be explained solely by gray matter atrophy which was more localized,"" Dr. Agosta said.She said the team's findings support the theory that AD pathology may travel along white matter fibers from one region of the brain to another. ""In early-onset AD and atypical AD forms, white matter degeneration may be an early marker that precedes gray matter atrophy,"" Dr. Agosta said. ""DTI has the potential to assess the extensive disorganization of brain networks in focal AD even before overt cognitive deficits become apparent."" Dr. Agosta said the study's findings also underline the importance of identifying and diagnosing patients with early onset and focal AD syndromes. ""Because there is not much structural damage in the early stages of focal Alzheimer's disease, there is a risk that patients may be misdiagnosed and excluded from clinical trials,"" she said.

The experiments provided new and convention-busting data about how sensory stimuli are processed by the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study, entitled ""Self-motion perception in autism is compromised by visual noise but integrated optimally across multiple senses,"" is published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors of the study are Adam Zaidel, of Israel's Bar-Ilan University, and Robin P. Goin-Kochel and Dora E. Angelaki, of Baylor College of Medicine in the United States. One of the hallmarks of ASD is superior low-level task performance alongside reduced performance in tasks that involve the processing of complex sensory data. This has led to the assumption that autism is characterized by a difficulty integrating individual units of perceptual data into global concepts. In line with this first assumption, it has further been proposed that individuals with autism have difficulty integrating multi-sensory input. With its unique experimental set-up, the new study has successfully challenged this conventional wisdom. Moreover, it has identified a neurological phenomenon associated with autism pathology: a heightened sensitivity to ""noisy"" sensory signals. ""Theories of global and multisensory integration deficits in ASD are deeply rooted in the scientific conversation about autism,"" says Dr. Adam Zaidel, a member of Bar-Ilan University's Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, who is the publication's lead author. ""Recently, this notion has come under scrutiny, as more and more investigators have observed discrepancies with experimental results."" ""In this study we show that heightened sensitivity to sensory noise - the random signals inserted into the visual tasks traditionally used by scientists to test sensory integration levels in autism - may provide an alternative explanation for impaired performance. When this noise is removed from the equation, the integration of visual motion stimuli in ASD is equal to, or maybe even superior to that of the control group. Moreover, our study demonstrates that the multi-sensory integration seen in autistic participants was comparable to that of the non-autistic control group."" Zaidel explains that visual motion processing in ASD has generally been examined through the use of a computer-based tool in which study participants are asked to designate the overall direction of motion of a field of dots, while a certain number of dots - the ""noise"" in an otherwise coherent picture - are randomly displaced. In these experiments, the level of noise at which participants can no longer determine overall direction is seen as a measure of the participant's innate ability to integrate isolated visual stimuli into a global picture. Zaidel's new approach proves that such traditional methods - which depend on noise as a modulator of task difficulty - have led to widespread misinterpretation of how individuals with ASD integrate visual stimuli. ""Our study is carried out in a 3D environment in which a field of moving dots generates the feeling of traveling through space, with different trials 'steering' to the right or left of straight ahead,"" Zaidel says. ""By asking participants to indicate their perceived direction of movement, we test their ability to create a global picture out of individual details. Significantly - and this is where our method differs from previous tests - we can achieve measureable results both when randomized dots are included in the overall picture, and in a completely coherent, noise-free environment."" Zaidel says that when there were no randomly-moving dots, autistic participants performed well, successfully determining the direction of movement at a level similar to that achieved by the non-ASD control group. When the noisy signals were introduced, however, the ASD group was significantly more affected than controls. This indicates that it is the presence of noise - rather than any innate integration deficit - that makes the task more difficult for people with autism. The unique experimental platform also allowed Zaidel to challenge another theory that has emerged more recently: that people with ASD are neurologically pre-disposed toward deficient integration of multi-sensory stimuli. The simulator used in the study was equipped with an ability to introduce movement into the chair in which the study participant was sitting - requiring the participant to respond to and interpret visual and vestibular stimuli at the same time. ""By adding movement to the experiment, we created a situation in which participants didn't just see the direction of the movement, but felt it as well,"" he says. ""In this scenario, people with autism displayed intact multi-sensory integration, completing tasks in a normative manner, both in a coherent, noiseless environment, and even when noise was present. These findings raise questions about prevalent theories related to multi-sensory integration deficits in ASD."" According to Zaidel, the new study provides support for the idea that people with autism are highly sensitive to incoming sensory information. Moreover, he suggests, they are predisposed toward relying more highly on external stimulation - with less use of prior knowledge - when interpreting the world around them. ""Our results suggest that people with autism may experience a deficiency in what are known in the scientific literature as Bayesian priors - the ability to draw on existing knowledge to understand what we see and to predict what we will see in the near future,"" Zaidel says. ""If you're more heavily weighted toward perceiving the world bottom up - from stimulus to perception - and relying less on rules of thumb from prior knowledge, perception will be both more taxing, and more sensitive to sensory noise."" In the future, Zaidel says, it may someday be possible to study this phenomenon directly in the brain, or to create treatments that might help autistic individuals become more adept at re-connecting to and using prior knowledge. However, he adds, future advances will depend on getting a clearer picture how the autistic brain processes sensory information and priors. ""In recent years, predominant theories about the nature of autism have become the subject of debate in the scientific community,"" he says. ""At the same time, the incidence of ASD diagnosis is on the rise. It is vitally important to understand autism's underlying neuropathology, so that scientists can create the studies that have the best chance of helping us face this challenge.""

But new research reveals that changes in our DNA during drug withdrawal may offer promising ways of developing more effective treatments for addiction. Withdrawal from drug use results in reprogramming of the genes in the brain that lead to addictive personality, say researchers from McGill University and Bar Ilan University in a new study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. ""We inherit our genes from our parents and these genes remain fixed throughout our life and are passed on to our children; we can do very little to change adverse genetics changes that we inherit,"" says Moshe Szyf, a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill, ""In contrast, epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation act as switches and dimmers of genes- they can be switched on, off, or dimmed -- by epigenetic drugs inhibiting DNA methylation and removing methyl marks from these genes."" The researchers wanted to see if they could stop addictive behavior by influencing the epigenetic markers that were triggered by withdrawal using epigenetic drugs such as the DNA methylation inhibitor, RG108. The team used a rat model of incubation of cocaine craving, in which rats were trained to self-administer cocaine which was cued by a specific light or sound. This drug craving or ""addictive"" behavior was tested after either 1 day or 30 days of withdrawal from cocaine. Following the long withdrawal, the rats developed an intense drug seeking behavior when exposed to the cue. It was after a lengthy period without the drugs that the epigenetic changes were most evident. ""We discovered that injecting the drug RG108 just before the animals were exposed to the light cue after the long withdrawal not only stopped the addictive behavior of the animals, it also lasted for a longer period. This suggests that a single treatment with RG108 could reverse or perhaps cure drug addiction."" adds Szyf. ""Surprisingly, we discovered that the biggest changes in DNA methylation occurred not during the exposure to the drug but during withdrawal,"" says co-author Gal Yadid, of Bar Ilan University, ""During this period of withdrawal, hundreds of genes changed their state of DNA methylation including genes that were known before to be involved in addiction."" This research may point to new avenues for treatment of addiction in humans. ""The mainstay of current approaches to treating addiction might actually aggravate it,"" says Yadid. ""Our research suggests that because the changes in addiction involve numerous genes, our current approaches will continue to fail if we target one or few targets in the brain, but more research is needed to confirm if these new avenues hold promise.""

The first study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, suggests that the H58-strain, which is likely to have emerged in Asia approximately thirty years ago, is now rapidly spreading across Africa, where it has been introduced on several separate occasions. A key feature of this strain appears to be its ability to acquire resistance to commonly available antibiotics. Dr Melita Gordon, from the University of Liverpool s Institute of Infection and Global Health, said:  Importantly, the antibiotic resistance genes, which have previously been carried on a separate genetic package, have now been incorporated into the main chromosome of the bacteria itself, which is likely to make it easier for the Typhoid strain to retain these resistance genes.  Data from the microbiology laboratory at the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, where bloodstream infections have been monitored for 18 years, show that an epidemic of Typhoid fever began in Malawi in 2011. In a related study, published in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, the team has investigated the epidemic and the re-emergence of the disease in Malawi by studying the genomes of the bacteria. Genomic data from the Malawi strains reveals that up until 2009 no H58 strains were found, and other local strains of Salmonella Typhi were fully sensitive to the antibiotics used locally. After 2010, a large number of different strains, however, appeared in Blantyre, competing for dominance. H58 emerged as the most successful strain, triggering a large epidemic in which up to 800 cases occurred per year, with a 3% case fatality. Dr Nick Feasey, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said:  The rise of antibiotic resistance among Salmonellae in Africa is a major threat and concern. Not only does it mean that individuals cannot always be effectively treated, but it also appears to make global spread and large epidemics more likely.  Liverpool scientists are now conducting further work at the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, funded by a  4 million Strategic Award from the Wellcome Trust, as part of a team led by the University of Oxford Vaccine Group, to investigate the best ways to use future vaccines to halt the spread of multidrug resistant Typhoid fever in Africa.

A hallmark of COPD is scarring of the lungs, a condition called pulmonary fibrosis, which impacts breathing. There is no cure for the condition or ability to repair the scarring that has occurred. Thus, in the late stages of lung disease, one remedy exists: organ transplantation. Unfortunately, the combination of a severe shortage of donor organs and frequent rejection of the transplant by the recipient s immune system has made even this method of last resort impractical for many. In new research by Cheryl Nickerson and her team at Arizona State University s Biodesign Institute and external collaborators, a radical approach to addressing the problems of transplantation potential and repairing scarred lungs is under investigation. In work appearing in the advanced online edition of the journal PLOS ONE, the researchers describe an elegant method to improve aspects of lung engineering that may in the future contribute to providing a nearly limitless supply of donor organs, ideally matched to their recipients, or to repairing damaged lungs.  Although years of work and further study remain before such research could be a reality in the clinic, the potential is there and the results in animal studies are promising. The research team builds upon previous research that involves the removal of cells from the lung of a deceased individual and reseeding the resulting decellularized scaffold structure with stem cells from the lung recipient. The desired future outcome of such work would be a fully functioning lung built from the organ recipient s own cells, therefore avoiding graft-host rejection. Although current research involves use of animal cells and scaffolds, the potential for translation to the clinic is an area of active research. The new study, jointly funded by NIH, NASA, and a Mayo Clinic-ASU seed grant, demonstrates a number of critical advantages to conducting the cell re-population process in a dynamic suspension culture, in which the cells are allowed to gently tumble as they re-seed the decellularized lung.  There is an urgent need for the development of lab-engineered lungs from patient stem cells that are suitable for both transplantation and as predictive models for biomedical research to probe the links between cell function and respiratory disease,  Nickerson said.  This was an extraordinarily challenging but rewarding study that took years to complete, and we are excited that it will contribute to the current and growing body of knowledge in the field with potential downstream implications for regenerative medicine as well as identifying the underlying factors that may contribute to the transition of normal to fibrotic lung disease.  Aur lie Crabb , lead author of the new study (formerly with the Nickerson group and now at Ghent University, Belgium), highlights the tremendous potential for this pioneering strategy.  Our study demonstrates that reseeding lung scaffolds under dynamic conditions could be beneficial for ex vivo lung engineering,  Crabb  said.  Dynamic culture conditions enhanced cell growth and viability, and stimulated stem cells to differentiate into matrix-producing cells as compared to static conditions   both findings might help rebuilding lungs from acellular scaffolds. ""Tremendous progress has recently been made on the use of cadaveric lungs as building blocks for the generation of new lungs, and we are hopeful that continued advancements in this field will one day provide a new source of much-needed organs.  Nickerson and Crabb  were part of a multidisciplinary, multi-institute team, including researchers from the University of Vermont College of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic Arizona; and Arizona State University s School of Life Sciences.  Pulmonary crisis COPD is a lung disease characterized by increasing difficulty in breathing. The disease is progressive; the most common culprit is damage to the lungs caused by cigarette smoking. The disease usually has two components, chronic bronchitis (an inflammation and partial blockage of the bronchial tubes supplying the lungs with air) and emphysema (loss of elasticity in the air sacs or alveoli of the lungs, causing shortness of breath). Cigarette smoking irritates the lung tissue and gradually destroys the malleable fibers of the lungs. Air pollution, chemical fumes, dust and secondhand smoke can also cause COPD. Symptoms of the disease include shortness of breath, tightening of the chest and persistent cough accompanied by mucus.  The underlying cause of these symptoms is scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis), which damages the lung tissue and cannot be repaired.  Little is known regarding the cause of the scarring.  Symptoms generally worsen with physical exercise. Flare-ups of severe symptoms, known as COPD exacerbation, become more frequent with disease progression and can be life-threatening. COPD is usually diagnosed in middle age. The disease has no cure, and in severe cases, the only available medical intervention is organ transplantation. The clinical success of lung transplantation, however, requires lifelong immunosuppression, and chronic rejection of the new organ is common, with patients showing only 10-20 percent survival rate 10 years after transplantation. Building designer lungs To overcome the severe shortage of suitable donor organs and the issue of organ rejection by the recipient s immune system, a daring new bioengineering strategy is being explored. The idea is to remove the cells from a donor lung extracted from a cadaver, reseed the remaining decellularized scaffold with stem cells from the patient, allow the cells to adhere to the scaffold, grow and mature into the different cell types found in the functioning lung, and transplant the freshly developed, functioning organ in a living organism. While not a reality for humans at this time, if successful in the future, this regenerative medicine approach holds the potential for a paradigm-shifting advance for sufferers of otherwise incurable lung disease. Currently, the approach is being explored in animal models. The decellularization process is accomplished by sequentially treating lung tissues with specialized detergents, salts and enzymes. These act to remove the cellular material of the lung, leaving just the stripped-down extracellular matrix   a kind of scaffolding on which the new lung will be constructed using stem cells from the recipient. To date, studies in which decellularized lungs from rodents were recellularized and transplanted showed marginal success in generating functioning pulmonary tissue. Experimental efforts have thus far demonstrated only partial recellularization of alveoli, airways and pulmonary vasculature. Though the fundamental approach appears sound, significant hurdles remain before the strategy can be applied to humans. In the current study, researchers sought to improve the recellularization of the lung scaffold in a mouse model. Two cell types were used for the recellularization process, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells, respectively. Stem-cell challenge Stem cells have the remarkable ability to differentiate into virtually any form of specialized cell in the body, when placed in the proper environment. Thus, the premise of the study is that stem cells exposed to the decellularized lung scaffold will take up residence and differentiate into all the specialized cell types necessary for a complete, functioning lung, much as the skeletal frame of a house is gradually dressed with walls, roof, windows and doors.  This is an audacious challenge, given the complexity of the lung, which contains more than 50 different cell types.  Accordingly, optimizing the recellularization efficiency of lung scaffolds with stem cells under conditions that mimic the parental tissue environment is critical to coax the cells to multiply and mature into the different respiratory cell types, and to achieve the long-term goal of developing functional lungs in the lab that could one day be suitable for transplantation, as well as for building models of diseased or injured lungs to understand the underlying mechanisms of why damage is happening. In an effort to improve lung recellularization, a dynamic rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor was used. In previous research, this cell-culture technique has been shown to promote growth and differentiation of stem and epithelial cells. The apparatus provides a continuous suspension of the repopulating cells, which are contained in horizontally rotating cylinders, filled with a nutrient-rich media. The motion of the RWV bioreactor offsets the natural sedimentation of cells, creating a gentle falling of cells along with their scaffolds contained in the culture medium. The activity mimics natural conditions of fluid shear   the motion of extracellular fluid over cell surfaces, which is believed to help direct proper growth and regeneration. In the current study, comparisons were made between standard methods of recellularization using cells grown on lung scaffolds under static conditions, and those grown dynamically in a rotating bioreactor. Cell fates The results showed markedly different outcomes for cells grown under static and dynamic conditions. The decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with mesenchymal stem cells for a total of 14 days displayed more abundant cells in the bioreactor, compared with static conditions. As a consequence, the quantity of RNA detected in recellularized lungs grown under bioreactor conditions was on average 3.8 times higher than for static recellularization. Cells were more homogeneously distributed across the recellularized lungs raised in the bioreactor, compared with their static counterparts. In the case of C10 epithelial alveolar cells, static conditions yielded poor recellularization results, with abundant cell debris and low RNA compared with an abundance of intact cells cultured in the bioreactor. Both MSCs and C10 cells exhibited lower rates of cell death or apoptosis and higher cell proliferation in bioreactor vs. static recellularization conditions. The authors speculate that biomechanical forces like fluid shear and accompanying changes in oxygenation, nutrient availability and waste dispersal, may contribute to the improved trajectories for cells grown in the dynamic suspension bioreactor system (RWV). Also, when grown in the RWV, the stem cells expressed phenotypic markers of matrix-producing cells, or fibroblasts. This cell type normally contributes to fibrosis in the lungs of patients with COPD and other lung diseases, leading to the generation of afunctional scar tissue. However, in the context of ex vivo lung regeneration using acellular scaffolds, these fibroblast-like cells could help rebuild the matrix, which is normally deteriorated due to the chemical treatment. Therefore, the differentiation of stem cells into fibroblast-like cells under dynamic culture conditions in the RWV might generate a microenvironment that is beneficial for other cell types to grow and differentiate into the desired functional lung tissue. In addition to furthering the immediate goals of the project focused on transplantation, study of decellularized scaffolds also provides a novel means of studying cell-matrix interactions and other aspects of normal and diseased lung biology.  Such studies will advance our understanding of how normal lung tissue becomes fibrotic, with potential for novel strategies to repair damaged lung tissue.  Imagine, if we can one day create a fully functional normal or fibrotic lung in the lab, understand the reasons why it behaves the way that it does, learn the tipping points that cause it to transition either way, and test how preventative therapies work,  Nickerson said.  The potential findings could have tremendous implications for diagnosis, treatment and prevention for a variety of respiratory disorders, including those due to infectious disease, cancer and environmental toxins.

Researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center have now identified six mRNA isoforms (bits of genetic material) produced by ovarian cancer cells but not normal cells, opening up the possibility that they could be used to diagnose early-stage ovarian cancer. What s more, several of the mRNA isoforms code for unique proteins that could be targeted with new therapeutics. We were inspired by many studies aimed at using DNA to detect cancer,  said first author Christian Barrett, PhD, bioinformatics expert and project scientist in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Institute for Genomic Medicine.  But we wondered if we could instead develop an ovarian cancer detection test based on tumor-specific mRNA that has disseminated from cancer cells to the cervix and can be collected during a routine Pap test.  While DNA carries all the instructions necessary for life, its actual sequence contains much more than just the genes that code for proteins. In contrast, mRNAs are complementary copies of just the genes. They carry the recipe for every protein that the cell will produce from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where cellular machinery can read the recipe and build the corresponding proteins. According to the authors of this study, the advantage of using cancer mRNA for diagnosis rather than DNA is sheer number   a cancer cell might harbor just one or a few copies of a DNA mutation, but mRNA variants can occur in hundreds to thousands of copies per cell. To determine if mRNAs can be used to distinguish ovarian cancer cells from normal cells, the team developed a custom bioinformatics algorithm and used it to mine two large public databases of genetic information   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program, both sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. TCGA is a catalog of RNA and DNA from 500 tumors covering many cancer types, while GTEx is a database of RNA and DNA from normal tissue samples. From these, the researchers were able to analyze mRNA sequence data from 296 ovarian cancers and 1,839 normal tissue samples. Using this bioinformatics approach, the researchers identified six mRNA isoform molecules that have the tumor specificity required for an early detection diagnostic of ovarian cancer. They also validated their digital results in the real world using RT-quantitative PCR, a gene amplifying technique, to detect the same ovarian cancer-specific mRNA molecules in lab-grown cells. Beyond their diagnostic potential, some of the mRNA isoforms identified in this study could also act as new therapeutic targets. These mRNA isoforms are predicted to encode proteins with unique amino acid sequences, which might allow them to be specifically targeted with certain therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies or T-cell-based vaccines. What s more, the ovarian cancer-specific mRNA isoforms themselves could also be targeted with new therapeutic drugs.  Our experimental findings were made in a laboratory and were performed on ovarian cancer cells from cell lines,  said study co-author Cheryl Saenz, MD, a clinical professor of reproductive medicine who specializes in treating gynecologic cancers.  Clinical trials will need to be conducted on women to confirm the presence of these markers in women that we know have cancer, as well as to document the absence of the markers in women that do not have ovarian cancer.  The authors acknowledge a few limitations to their approach, including technical limitations in detecting mRNA isoforms, a shortage of normal ovarian and fallopian tube control samples and the possibility that tumor cells that disseminate to the cervix may not genetically act the same as the primary tumor. Still, based on these promising initial results, the authors recommend expanding their process for identifying tumor-specific mRNA isoforms to the 30 additional tumor types for which sufficient amounts of RNA sequence already exist.","Published: May 27, 2015"

But now there is a faster, cheaper and smaller way for researchers to bring gold-standard analysis to the field. Researchers from Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration have combined their sensors, biotechnology and instrumentation expertise to develop a portable, autonomous device that analyzes trace elements. The highly miniaturized microbial analysis machine, called the ddPCR Bioanalytical Field Instrument, allows researchers to do things such as detect microbes in water, soil and the upper atmosphere. The machine, which was recently highlighted in a Nature Methods article, is portable, exceptionally low-power, robust enough for long-term field deployment, doesn't require cleaning, and is easy to deploy and operate. Developed by a team led by experimental physicist Cody Youngbull, assistant research professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, the technology was originally intended for deployment on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle platform as part of a project to map the dynamic microbial diversity in the world's oceans. After four years of development and millions of dollars from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the National Science Foundation and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the instrument is now operational. It is being used at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project to detect microbial contaminants in water more rapidly, with better accuracy and lower limits of detection. The device employs emulsion droplet technology, which means that the aqueous sample comes into the instrument and is coated in oil, thus keeping it from ever contacting the internal components. Once samples are loaded, reagents are mixed, processed and analyzed in perfect isolation. The data is then quantified directly in the field for immediate feedback. The small droplets enable the device to produce millions of copies of any specified DNA sequence in minutes. With the emergent capability to perform this sort of analysis on an autonomous underwater vehicle, the device is quite adaptable to the needs of the researcher and has great potential for monitoring other locations in the field, including the built environment. According to Youngbull, while it does have health applications since it is able to quantify pathogens, he doesn't see it as a medical diagnostic tool. ""It's designed for exploration,"" he said. ""Being able to detect trace components, single molecules, autonomously and reliably, without the need for sample return or hardware consumables in a really tiny, low-power package are what our machine is all about."" Although there may be limited medical diagnostic applications, Youngbull envisions use of the device in homeland security, mass transit, public spaces, hospitals, schools, food production and combat theater analytics. Autonomous, digital droplet PCR is useful for many aspects of science. The device might even one day be integrated into a rover, lander or orbiter to seek out extant DNA in the water on Mars, the oceans of Europa, the ice plumes of Enceladus or wherever scientist-explorers one day hope to discover and quantify nucleic acid sequences.","Published: May 27, 2015"

The research focuses on a particular class of enzymes that biosynthesize carbohydrates (i.e. glycans) complex biological molecules controlling multiple aspects of cell biology as well as on their attendant microRNA (miRNA), which are regulatory molecules that spur changes in a cell by inhibiting protein expression. ""Carbohydrates present a challenge for analysis because their complexity and 'noise' that accompanies their biosynthesis make it difficult to isolate how they are involved in cellular change,"" explains Lara Mahal, an associate professor in NYU's Dept. of Chemistry and the study's senior author. ""Our results show that rather than trying to trace the intricacies of this molecule's activity, we can simply track miRNA."" Specifically, she adds, miRNA can illuminate which glycogenes, or genes encoding glycosylation enzymes, are vital in a biological pathway. Previous research by Mahal and her colleagues found that miRNA molecules used to regulate gene expression serve as major regulators of the cell's surface-level carbohydrates. The discovery showed, for the first time, that miRNA play a significant regulatory role in this part of the cell, also known as the glycome. In the new study, her research team focused on determining whether miRNA could be used as a ""decoder ring"" to reveal the role of specific glycans in biology. They focused on miR-200, a miRNA family controlling the movement of cells in processes such as wound healing and tumor-cell metastasis, to determine if it could predict the biological function of a trio of glycans that are notoriously hard to monitor. Their research found that disruption of these three glycans had the same effect as miR-200. For example, both miR-200 and cells in which any of these three glycans were disrupted lost their ability to move, a critical function in healing wounds and in cancer metastasis. MiRNA are far easier to analyze than glycosylation and are a useful tool to shed light on the role of glycosylation in human diseases and afflictions. This is especially important as carbohydrates play important roles in every disease, which we have yet to understand, Mahal notes. ""Cleft palates, coronary artery disease, and other conditions involve biological pathways that we largely don't understand,"" she explains.

A new study by researchers at Indiana Univ. says these estimates are more uncertain than commonly believed. Researchers Kerry Krutilla, David H. Good and John D. Graham of the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs analyzed the costs and expected lifesavings of nine regulations issued between 2011 and 2013. The bulk of these regulations require national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants. The analysis includes the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule. The researchers estimate that the lives saved from this group of regulations could plausibly range from none to more than 80,000 per year. The range reflects uncertainty about the health effects of fine particles, and the possibility that airborne exposures to fine particles do not increase mortality risks. The higher bound for lives saved is comparable to estimates by the EPA, but the possibility that no lives are saved is not reflected in standard EPA analyses of these regulations. If exposures to fine particles do not increase the risk of premature deaths, then most of the regulations in the study are less likely to have economic benefits in excess of their costs. The IU research is based on a re-evaluation of an EPA-sponsored ""expert elicitation"" study conducted in 2006. The study surveyed the opinion of experts about the health effects of fine particle exposures. The elicitation format allows experts to synthesize and adjust the empirical findings for limitations in the research area.

However, rare individuals   around one in a million people in the UK   are born unable to feel pain. These people accumulate numerous self-inflicted injuries, often leading to reduced lifespan. Using detailed genome mapping, two teams of researchers collaborated to analyse the genetic make-up of 11 families across Europe and Asia affected by an inherited condition known as congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). This enabled them to pinpoint the cause of the condition to variants of the gene PRDM12. Family members affected by CIP carried two copies of the variant; however, if they had only inherited one copy from their parents, they were unaffected. The team looked at nerve biopsies taken from the patients to see what had gone wrong and found that particular pain-sensing neurons were absent. From these clinical features of the disease, the team predicted that there would be a block to the production of pain-sensing neurons during the development of the embryo   they confirmed this using a combination of studies in mouse and frog models, and in human induced pluripotent stem cells (skin cells that had been reset to their  master state , which enables them to develop into almost any type of cell in the body). PRDM12 had previously been implicated in the modification of chromatin, a small molecule that attaches to our DNA and acts like a switch to turn genes on and off (an effect known as epigenetics). The researchers showed that all the genetic variants of PRDM12 in the CIP patients blocked the gene's function. As chromatin is particularly important during formation of particular specialised cell types such as neurons, this provides a possible explanation for why pain-sensing neurons do not form properly in the CIP patients. ""The ability to sense pain is essential to our self-preservation, yet we understand far more about excessive pain than we do about lack of pain perception,"" says Professor Geoff Woods from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research at the University of Cambridge, who co-led the study. ""Both are equally important to the development of new pain treatments   if we know the mechanisms that underlie pain sensation, we can then potentially control and reduce unnecessary pain."" PRDM12 is only the fifth gene related to lack of pain perception to have been identified to date. However, two of the previously-discovered genes have already led to the development of new pain killers that are currently been tested in clinical trials. ""We are very hopeful that this new gene could be an excellent candidate for drug development, particularly given recent successes with drugs targeting chromatin regulators in human disease,"" adds Dr Ya-Chun Chen from the University of Cambridge, the study s first author. ""This could potentially benefit those who are at danger from lack of pain perception and help in the development of new treatments for pain relief.""","Published: May 27, 2015"

Credit Wilmer Photography.  The disease, diabetic retinopathy, is the most common cause of vision loss in working-age adults in the U.S. Diabetic eye disease occurs when the normal blood vessels in the eye are replaced over time with abnormal, leaky, fragile blood vessels that leak fluid or bleed into the eye, damaging the light-sensitive retina and causing blindness. Forty to 45% of Americans with diabetes have diabetic retinopathy, according to the National Eye Institute. Laser-sealing eye blood vessels can save central vision, but this often sacrifices peripheral and night vision, according to Akrit Sodhi, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins Univ. School of Medicine. Several recently developed drugs bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept can help treat these blood vessels by blocking the action of VEGF, a so-called growth factor released as part of a chain of signals in response to low oxygen levels, which stimulates the growth of new, often abnormal, blood vessels. But studies have shown that although these drugs slow progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy, it does not reliably prevent it. Looking for an explanation, postdoctoral fellow Savalan Babapoor-Farrokhran, MD, and Kathleen Jee, a student at the school of medicine who will begin her residency in ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins next year, tested levels of VEGF in samples of fluid from the eye taken from healthy people, people with diabetes who did not have diabetic retinopathy and people with diabetic retinopathy of varying severity. While levels of VEGF tended to be higher in those with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, some of their fluid had less VEGF than did the healthy participants. But even the low-VEGF fluid from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy stimulated blood vessel growth in lab-grown cells. ""The results suggested to us that although VEFG clearly plays an important role in blood vessel growth, it's not the only factor,"" Sodhi says. A series of experiments in lab-grown human cells and mice revealed a second culprit, a protein called angiopoietin-like 4. When the researchers blocked the action of both VEGF and angiopoietin-like 4 in fluid from the eyes of people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, it markedly reduced blood vessel growth in lab-grown cells. If a drug can be found that safely blocks the second protein's action in patients' eyes, it might be combined with the anti-VEGF drugs to prevent many cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, Sodhi suggests. The team is now investigating whether angiopoietin-like 4 might also play a role in other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, which destroys the central portion of the retina.","Published: May 27, 2015"

""One of the goals in nanoparticle self-assembly has been to create structures by design,"" said Oleg Gang, who led the work at Brookhaven'sCenter for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), a DOE Office of Science User Facility. ""Until now, most of the structures we've built have been static.  Now we are trying to achieve an even more ambitious goal: making materials that can transform so we can take advantage of properties that emerge with the particles' rearrangements.""The ability to direct particle rearrangements, or phase changes, will allow the scientists to choose the desired properties say, the material's response to light or a magnetic field and switch them as needed. Such phase-changing materials could lead to new applications, such as dynamic energy-harvesting or responsive optical materials.Introducing ""reprogramming"" DNA strands into an already assembled nanoparticle array triggers a transition from a ""mother phase,"" where particles occupy the corners and center of a cube (left), to a more compact ""daughter phase"" (right). Such phase-changes could potentially be used to switch a material's properties on demand. This latest advance in nanoscale engineering builds on the team's previous work developing ways to get nanoparticles to self-assemble into complex composite arrays, including linking them together with tethers constructed of complementary strands of synthetic DNA. In this case, they started with an assembly of nanoparticles already linked in a regular array by the complementary binding of the A, T, G, and C bases on single stranded DNA tethers, then added ""reprogramming"" DNA strands to alter the interparticle interactions.  ""We know that properties of materials built from nanoparticles are strongly dependent on their arrangements,"" said Gang. ""Previously, we've even been able to manipulate optical properties by shortening or lengthening the DNA tethers. But that approach does not permit us to achieve a global reorganization of the entire structure once it's already built."" In the new approach, the reprogramming DNA strands adhere to open binding sites on the already assembled nanoparticles. These strands exert additional forces on the linked-up nanoparticles. ""By introducing different types of reprogramming DNA strands, we modify the DNA shells surrounding the nanoparticles,"" explained CFN postdoctoral fellow Yugang Zhang, the lead author on the paper. ""Altering these shells can selectively shift the particle-particle interactions, either by increasing both attraction and repulsion, or by separately increasing only attraction or only repulsion. These reprogrammed interactions impose new constraints on the particles, forcing them to achieve a new structural organization to satisfy those constraints."" Using their method, the team demonstrated that they could switch their original nanoparticle array, the ""mother"" phase, into multiple different daughter phases with precision control. This is quite different from phase changes driven by external physical conditions such as pressure or temperature, Gang said, which typically result in single phase shifts, or sometimes sequential ones. ""In those cases, to go from phase A to phase C, you first have to shift from A to B and then B to C,"" said Gang. ""Our method allows us to pick which daughter phase we want and go right to that one because the daughter phase is completely determined by the type of DNA reprogramming strands we use."" The scientists were able to observe the structural transformations to various daughter phases using a technique called in situ small-angle x-ray scattering at the National Synchrotron Light Source, another DOE Office of Science User Facility that operated at Brookhaven Lab from 1982 until last September (now replaced by NSLS-II, which produces x-ray beams 10,000 times brighter). The team also used computational modeling to calculate how different kinds of reprogramming strands would alter the interparticle interactions, and found their calculations agreed well with their experimental observations. ""The ability to dynamically switch the phase of an entire superlattice array will allow the creation of reprogrammable and switchable materials wherein multiple, different functions can be activated on demand,"" said Gang. ""Our experimental work and accompanying theoretical analysis confirm that reprogramming DNA-mediated interactions among nanoparticles is a viable way to achieve this goal.""","Published: May 27, 2015"

Rice researchers David Zhang, an assistant professor of bioengineering, and lead author and graduate student J. Sherry Wang applied their new molecular tools to 44 DNA samples with known cancer-related single-nucleotide variants. Their proof-of-principle study located the variants with a high level of accuracy. They view their results as a significant step toward advancing personalized medicine. The ability to accurately find mutations that are biomarkers for disease will help clinicians determine treatment paths for patients, Zhang said. It may also help identify rare mutations and subtypes of infectious diseases as well as drug-resistant strains. A single-nucleotide variant occurs when one of the four basic components that make up DNA or RNA mutates. Nucleotide variations are responsible for an individual s characteristics, like eye color, but mutations can leave the body vulnerable to disease, or even be the root cause. The ability to accurately find rare single-nucleotide mutations is becoming increasingly important as scientists drill down into genomes to find biomarkers for early cancer detection.  We re trying to solve the needle-in-a-haystack problem,  Zhang said.  Basically, how do you detect a very rare mutation in a large pile of healthy DNA molecules? The needle you re looking for might be a cancer-mutation DNA or bacterial-pathogen DNA, and the hay is healthy human DNA, maybe from blood.  Traditionally, researchers build a magnet that s very good at fishing out the needle,  Zhang said.  It s supposed to bind to the needle, but not to the hay. But that only works to a certain extent, and even the best magnets so far can barely pull one needle from 20 pieces of hay or so.  We decided to add a goat, which goes around and eats hay, so you have a much smaller pile and can pull out your needles.  The challenge, Zhang said, is to keep the competing forces balanced.  There s a very difficult Goldilocks zone of how strong you want your magnet to be and how hungry you want your goat to be,  he said.  Our paper basically shows there s a small window in which you can design them to get very high specificity. We can find, on average, one needle for every thousand pieces of hay.  The Rice team s tool involves  competitive compositions  of synthetic reagents that bind to particular gene sequences. What they call the probe (the magnet) and sink (the goat) are sequence-specific DNA molecules that root out single-nucleotide variant targets in solutions that also include healthy  wild-type  sequences. The toehold-based sinks bind to the wild-type DNA and leave the probes to seek out mutations in the target DNA. Zhang and Wang carried this hybridization technique a step further as they determined the optimal conditions   the window   for each experiment, based on simulations. By simulating experiments in computers and observing the results, they were able to design actual chemistry experiments and reagents with much better performance than traditional trial-and-error approaches. Because the probes  specificity and sensitivity tend to be mutually exclusive except in the narrow Goldilocks zone, finding the zone for each was critical. Under the right conditions (based on the sequences, the simulation-aided design of the probe and sink, the reagent concentrations and the assay conditions), the lab s custom X-Probes attached to mutant DNA with a particular binding affinity and fluoresced; they ignored wild-type sequences that had slightly different affinity. Tests on amplified human genome samples showed excellent accuracy as well, they said. Zhang noted the technique should lead to significant savings, especially for research labs.  Cost is not the primary contribution here, although we did reduce it by a factor of five to 10,  he said.  For researchers, it matters whether a test costs $20 or $300, especially if you re doing a multiplexed assay that checks for a few hundred different target mutations.  The real benefit is still being able to do more specific detection, basically being able to detect mutations at a much earlier phase when there s not as much cancer DNA floating around,  he said.","Published: May 27, 2015"

Messenger RNA (mRNA) translates DNA s genetic information into codes for proteins. A recently discovered class of noncoding RNA molecules, short stretches of RNA called microRNAs (miRNAs) has been shown to interact with mRNA and block protein production. More than 3,000 miRNAs have been found in the human genome. A single miRNA can regulate the activity of hundreds of genes, thus impacting entire cellular networks. Genetic variations in the gene encoding a particular microRNA   miRNA-137   have been linked with an increased risk for schizophrenia. While schizophrenia is tied to multiple genes,  a more complete picture of miRNAs may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia,  Tsai says. Exactly how genetic variations impact miRNA-137 levels   and effects of miRNA-137 in the brain   is unclear.  It s important to understand how abnormal levels of miRNA-137 impact cellular function,  says co-author Sandra Siegert, a postdoc in the Picower Institute. Siegert found that in reprogrammed neurons from human fibroblasts of diseased patients, microRNA-137 was increased. This was, in turn, tied to presynaptic defects and impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction. This was a surprise, she says, because although schizophrenia is considered  a disease of the synapse,  nobody had ever shown that microRNAs could influence the mechanism through which neurotransmitters are released at the synapse.  This work demonstrates that miRNAs directly impact synaptic proteins,  Tsai says.  This shows a master regulator role for MiRNA-137 as an exciting common regulator of presynaptic function.  The study proves that  just by down-regulating miRNA-137, we were able to improve synaptic transmission in neurons,  Siegert says.  This is very promising, and shows the beneficial effects  of manipulating miRNA-137. MiRNAs also have been found to be a gateway for environmental factors  influence on cellular mechanisms. For instance, drug abuse or stress can alter miRNA levels.  If we knew which environmental factors affected MiRNA-137, there might be a simple approach to tweaking it. If genetic testing showed an individual was a carrier of the risk-related variation of the MiRNA-137 gene, avoiding an unhealthy lifestyle or drugs in a critical phase of brain development might prevent disease onset,  Siegert says. This work is supported by the Simons Center for the Social Brain and the National Institutes of Health.","Published: May 27, 2015"

The highly specialized cells of the germline, called germ cells, are the only cell type in the body capable of passing parents  genes on to their biological children. Abnormalities in the germ cells can cause infertility as well as diseases such as germ cell tumors in young boys and primary ovarian insufficiency in young girls. Published by the journal Cell, the study looks closely at how the genetic information of prenatal germ cells is shielded from harm during prenatal life, showing that these important cells lack protection during a phase of development, leaving them vulnerable to damage.  My overall research goal is to understand the causes of human infertility, so taking a close look at how germ cells develop in the embryo is crucial,  said Clark, associate professor and vice chair of molecular, cell and developmental biology in the life sciences at UCLA.  We know very little about how prenatal germline cells are made in the body; I am working to understand what they are sensitive to during development and what is protecting them from external environmental factors that could cause them to not work properly.  A biochemical process that is crucial for protecting human genetic information, commonly known as the genome, is called methylation. All healthy cells in the human body are methylated. Methylation acts as a protective coat on the genome that safeguards cells from mutations. If cells don t have methylation, the genome is vulnerable to damage. Methylation removal, called demethylation, happens very infrequently in the human body. One such time is during a short period of time in prenatal life during pregnancy. This period of germ cell demethylation was the focus of Clark s study, which mapped the amount, duration and location of demethylation in prenatal germ cells from 53 to 137 days of development. The study found that the human germline erases almost all evidence of genome methylation by 113 days of prenatal development. Importantly, while a large amount of demethylation did occur, some areas of the germ cells retained a small amount of methylation.  The quality of a person s germline cells, which are created before they are born, is going to have a huge effect on that person s ability to have children as an adult,  said Clark.  Removal of methylation from the germline during prenatal life leaves the germline cells vulnerable to damage. This leads to a critical question: what protects prenatal germline cells from damage or environmental insult during pregnancy? To answer this question, I ve been working to create the first scientific model for the earliest steps in human germline formation.  The model Clark is developing requires her to make human prenatal germline cells from pluripotent stem cells in the lab. In this way, she can study how the germline cells are impacted by various factors such as external chemicals or toxins. Creating cells in the lab is a powerful tool provided by pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to become any cell in the body. Using pluripotent stem cells, scientists can create diseased tissue in a lab dish. This method, called disease-in-a-dish, allows researchers to create models for human disease, which they then use to study the disease and to test drugs that might reverse or treat the disease at a cellular level. However, one of the challenges with the disease-in-a-dish method is that scientists must ensure that cells created in the lab are as close as possible to cells found in a human. Clark must ensure that the prenatal germ cells she creates in the lab for disease-in-a-dish modeling retain just the right amount of methylation in the right areas so they resemble human prenatal germ cells as closely as possible. In the study, Clark and her team present a detailed  reference map  that contains hundreds of millions of data points. The reference map can be used to ensure prenatal germ cells created in the lab have the same methylation characteristics as the prenatal germ cells found in a normal human during prenatal life.  This reference map takes the guess work out of making prenatal germline cells from stem cells,  said Clark.  Now that we have a high-resolution quantitative analysis of real human germline cells during prenatal life, we can use this information as we make human prenatal germline cells from stem cells for disease-in-a-dish modeling.

Snugly housed in the bony confines of the skull, it s also relatively inaccessible, making it difficult to study. Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have devised a way to generate spherical, free-floating balls of human brain cells that mimic the architecture of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of brain tissue responsible for how we experience and perceive the world around us and how we interact with others. The spheres contain functional neurons, working synapses and even critical support cells called astrocytes that maintain neural function. They also express genes in patterns similar to a human fetal brain midway through pregnancy. The researchers hope that tracking the development of the cortex-like spheroids over time and observing the interactions of their cells may shed light on human brain development and the molecular causes of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.  One of the major problems in understanding mental disorders is that we can t directly access the human brain,  said Sergiu Pasca, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.  These spheroids closely resemble the three-dimensional architecture of the cortex and have gene-expression patterns that mimic those in a developing fetal brain.  Previous attempts to create patient-specific neural tissue for study have either generated two-dimensional colonies of immature neurons that do not create functional synapses, or required an external matrix on which to grow the cells in a series of laborious and technically difficult steps. In contrast, the researchers found they were able to easily make hundreds of what they ve termed  human cortical spheroids  using a single human skin sample. These spheroids grow to be as large as 5 millimeters in diameter and can be maintained in the laboratory for nine months or more. They exhibit complex neural network activity and can be studied with techniques well-honed in animal models. Pasca is the senior author of a study, published online May 25 in Nature Methods, that describes the work. Postdoctoral scholar and neonatology fellow Anca Pasca, MD, and graduate student Steven Sloan share lead authorship of the paper. (Sergiu Pasca and Anca Pasca are married.)  The power and promise of this new method is extraordinary,  said co-author Ben Barres, PhD, professor of neurobiology, of developmental biology and of neurology and neurological sciences.  For instance, for developmental brain disorders, one could take skin cells from any patient and literally replay the development of their brain in a culture dish to figure out exactly what step of development went awry   and how it might be corrected. For Alzheimer s disease, one could do the same to determine if the neurons or glia are abnormal and, if so, what is malfunctioning. Now we can move away from mouse as a model and instead generate functional neurons and glia from humans with literally any disease.  Looking for a good model The researchers embarked on the study after becoming frustrated with the lack of a good model system to study human brain development and function. Although techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging allow scientists to broadly visualize brain activity, they don t give an up-close-and-personal look at the complex neural networks necessary for brain function. Post-mortem tissue can give a sense of brain structure, but not of function.  I m a neurobiologist,  Sergiu Pasca said.  I need to study neurons that are firing.  The researchers first created seven batches of induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, from the skin of five people. IPS cells have the ability to become nearly any tissue in the body when grown under particular conditions. They grew the iPS cells into flat, multicellular colonies on the surface of a laboratory dish. The researchers then carefully detached the intact colonies and moved them to special laboratory dishes treated to make it difficult for cells to adhere to the dishes. Within a few hours, the colonies began to fold upon themselves to create spheres. They then treated the cells with a combination of growth factors and small molecules to promote their development into neural progenitor cells. After about seven weeks, nearly 80 percent of the cells in the spheres expressed a protein made by neural tissue. Furthermore, about 7 percent of the cells expressed another protein specifically made by astrocytes   star-shaped support cells that wrap around the synapses, the junctions between neurons.  Astrocytes are really essential to neuronal signaling,  Pasca said.  But it s been challenging to efficiently make both neurons and astrocytes at the same time. Until now, researchers have been relying on astrocytes from rodents or human fetal tissue, and trying to grow neurons on top of them. Our system generates astrocytes that develop in concert with and are genetically identical to the surrounding neurons.  When human cortical spheroids, or hCSs, were sliced, they exhibited architecture similar to the human cortex.  In contrast to monolayer cultures, we observed an orderly, three-dimensional arrangement of specific types of neuronal cells in the hCSs,  Pasca said. That organization is primarily driven by the cells themselves, the researchers found.  If anyone had asked me before we conducted this study what it would really take to recreate the human cortex, I would have said it would require all sorts of specific molecular cues and many other conditions of which we re not even aware,  said Pasca.  But in reality, once the program starts, and a few conditions are met, the cells themselves are doing the rest of the job.  The final test of the human cortical spheroids was to slice them and perform functional tests. The researchers found that up to 80 percent of the neurons in the spheres were capable of firing when stimulated. Furthermore, 86 percent of the neurons exhibited spontaneous neural signaling and participated in neural network activity.  We ve been treating them just like we would slices of mouse brain,  Pasca said,  and trying to answer functional questions. We ve found that if we stimulate one side of the slice, we can record cortical activity on the other side.

Their findings were published in the June issue of the scientific journal RNA. Levels of human Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1), which is involved in many cellular functions, have been shown to correlate with drug resistance and poor patient outcomes in a variety of cancers. The observation that this cancer biomarker is tightly linked to a surprisingly large and diverse class of RNAs, and the known associations of some of these RNAs to cancer opens an opportunity to discover a potentially very important pathway in human biology and cancer, said senior investigator Bino John, Ph.D., adjunct professor, Pitt School of Medicine, where the research was conducted. Intriguingly, one of the abundant RNAs that the team discovered was found to originate from the widely known DNA region of the Dicer1 gene and was determined to control multiple genes involved in cancer progression.   Many small RNAs known as microRNAs already have been shown to correlate with different grades of prostate cancer and could potentially serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment,  Dr. John said.  We did this study after computer models led us to hypothesize that there was a connection between YB-1 and microRNAs. What started out as a curiosity-driven experiment ended up being an exhilarating treasure hunt over four years, culminating in the discovery of two big molecular finds from human cells.  The Pitt scientists discovered that YB-1 associated with many microRNAs, and were surprised by the realization that YB-1 associated with thousands of RNAs that were never before known. The team grouped the RNAs into what they called YB-1 associated short non-coding RNAs, or shyRNAs, and their smaller, processed counterparts, dubbed YB-1 associated small RNAs (smyRNAs).  We conducted functional assays on one of these RNAs, and found that it had the ability to suppress cancer cell growth when it interacted with YB-1,  said co-senior author Donald B. DeFranco, Ph.D., professor of pharmacology and chemical biology, Pitt School of Medicine.  More work must be done to determine how these shyRNAs interact to influence cancer progression and perhaps influence other diseases.  The team included Teresa T.

Biocartis and Fast-track diagnostics plan to collaborate on a new approach to infectious disease diagnostics,  syndromic multiplex testing,  which enables the identification of a broader range of disease pathogens in a single test. Most current methods focus on the detection of one or a few pathogens expected to be present in a patient sample. If the sample is negative, a new test will be performed for other pathogens, increasing the time to result. With syndromic multiplex tests, the initial test will not just look for the most likely pathogen, but also for a range of less likely pathogens, preventing the need to retest. As part of the collaboration, tests from Fast-track diagnostics  comprehensive infectious disease menu will be developed for use on Biocartis  innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) platform, Idylla . Idylla  is a fully-automated MDx system that delivers accurate, rapid tests in virtually any setting, from virtually any biological sample type, and without the need for pre-processing or specialist training. The first assay to be developed under the collaboration is a multiplex respiratory panel for the detection of viral and bacterial targets in upper respiratory tract infections. Financial details of the agreement are not disclosed. Erik Vossenaar, VP Business Development of Biocartis, commented:  In line with our strategy to rapidly expand our test menu, we are excited to be collaborating with Fast-track diagnostics to further enhance our position in infectious diseases. By combining Fast-track diagnostics  expertise and compelling portfolio of multiplex PCR panels with the multiplex capabilities and unique features of our Idylla system, we have formed a powerful combination to create tests that can identify multiple disease driving pathogens from a patient sample.  Bill Carman, Chief Executive Officer of Fast-track diagnostics, commented:  Fast-track diagnostics is delighted to be collaborating with Biocartis. We are dedicated to developing high-quality, accurate multiplex PCR panels and look forward to working with the Biocartis team to develop a range of tests for the Idylla system.

A 2015 Health Canada report estimates that superbugs have already cost Canadians $1 billion, and are a  serious and growing issue.  Each year two million people in the U.S. contract antibiotic-resistant infections, and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result. But tests for antibiotic resistance can take up to three days to come back from the lab, hindering doctors  ability to treat bacterial infections quickly. Now PhD researcher Justin Besant and his team at the University of Toronto have designed a small and simple chip to test for antibiotic resistance in just one hour, giving doctors a shot at picking the most effective antibiotic to treat potentially deadly infections. Their work was published this week in the international journal Lab on a Chip. Resistant bacteria arise in part because of imprecise use of antibiotics when a patient comes down with an infection, the doctor wants to treat it as quickly as possible. Samples of the infectious bacteria are sent to the lab for testing, but results can take two to three days. In the meantime, the doctor prescribes her patient a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Sometimes the one-size-fits-all antibiotic works and sometimes it doesn t, and when the tests come back days later, the doctor can prescribe a specific antibiotic more likely to kill the bacteria.  Guessing can lead to resistance to these broad-spectrum antibiotics, and in the case of serious infections, to much worse outcomes for the patient,  says Besant.  We wanted to determine whether bacteria are susceptible to a particular antibiotic, on a timescale of hours, not days.  The problem with most current tests is the time it takes for bacteria to reproduce to detectable levels. Besant and his team, including his supervisor Professor Shana Kelley of the Institute for Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering and the Faculties of Pharmacy and Medicine, and Professor Ted Sargent of The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, drew on their collective expertise in electrical and biomedical engineering to design a chip that concentrates bacteria in a miniscule space just two nanolitres in volume in order to increase the effective concentration of the starting sample. They achieve this high concentration by  flowing  the sample, containing the bacteria to be tested, through microfluidic wells patterned onto a glass chip. At the bottom of each well a filter, composed of a lattice of tiny microbeads, catches bacteria as the sample flows through. The bacteria accumulate in the nano-sized well, where they re trapped with the antibiotic and a signal molecule called resazurin. Living bacteria metabolize resazurin into a form called resorufin, changing its electrochemical signature. If the bacteria are effectively killed by the antibiotic, they stop metabolizing resazurin and the electrochemical signature in the sample stays the same. If they are antibiotic-resistant, they continue to metabolize resazurin into resorufin, altering its electrochemical signature. Electrodes built directly into the chip detect the change in current as resazurin changes to resorufin.  This gives us two advantages,  says Besant.  One, we have a lot of bacteria in a very small space, so our effective starting concentration is much higher. And two, as the bacteria multiply and convert the resazurin molecule, it s effectively stuck in this nanolitre droplet it can t diffuse away into the solution, so it can accumulate more rapidly to detectable levels.   Our approach is the first to combine this method of increasing sample concentration with a straightforward electrochemical readout,  says Professor Sargent.  We see this as an effective tool for faster diagnosis and treatment of commonplace bacterial infections.  Rapid alternatives to existing antibiotic resistance tests rely on fluorescence detection, requiring expensive and bulky fluorescence microscopes to see the result.  The electronics for our electrochemical readout can easily fit in a very small benchtop instrument, and this is something you could see in a doctor s office, for example,  says Besant.  The next step would be to create a device that would allow you to test many different antibiotics at many different concentrations, but we re not there yet. ","Published: May 27, 2015"

Scientists at VIB, KU Leuven and Janssen Pharmaceutica have demonstrated that the distribution of these aggregates through the brain is facilitated by synaptic connections between brain cells. This news is highly significant because the focus is increasingly on repairing synaptic connections as a therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s. In fact, it is generally accepted that a loss of synaptic connections leads to a loss in cognitive skills. Dieder Moechars (Janssen Pharmaceutica): ""Looking at our results, we would advise caution regarding the therapeutic approach to the repair of synapses. Our research suggests that synapses also promote the distribution of Tau aggregates, which could counteract the positive effects of a repaired synapse. It is also important to take this into account when developing new therapeutic strategies, for example by combining a synapse restoring approach with one that would remove the Tau aggregate at the synapse."" Patrik Verstreken (VIB/KU Leuven): ""We have set up a new in vitro system specifically for this research, to enable us to study the distribution throughout the brain of aggregate proteins that are typical of neurodegenerative diseases. We also want to use this system to explore which substances could counteract the progress of neurodegeneration in the brain without having to use animal models at this early stage. This could become an important tool in the search for potential drugs against, for example, Alzheimer's disease.' Brain cells communicate via synapses. Successful synaptic connections are vital in order to function properly. Synaptic degeneration is a prime symptom in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. With Alzheimer's, the loss of synapses results in a decline in cognitive skills. That is why a lot of research is being carried out into treatments focused on the repair of synapses. Together with colleagues at VIB, KU Leuven and Janssen Pharmaceutica, Sara Calafate, Patrik Verstreken and Dieder Moechars discovered that this approach is not straightforward. Sara Calafate: ""We noticed that the spread of Tau aggregates, a typical characteristic of Alzheimer's, proceeded much more effectively via interconnecting brain cells. But it was not clear what role the synapses played in this process. We have now managed to demonstrate that synapses facilitate this distribution and can probably promote neurodegeneration in this way."" Scientists developed a new research tool for this study that enabled them to monitor the spread of Tau aggregates whilst changing the synaptic connections between brain cells. They grew brain cells in microscopically small chambers that made it possible to separate synaptic connections from the rest of the cells. When synaptic connections were made, researchers observed that the distribution of Tau was 50 % more efficient than in the absence of synaptic connections. Patrik Verstreken: ""Our research into brain diseases is not possible without animal models. Nevertheless, we are constantly looking for ways in which we can minimize the number of animal tests. This new tool could help us achieve this.""

""Brainstorm barometer"" is based on the hypothesis that the brainstorms generated by the billions of neurons inside a baby's head are governed by the same rules as other massive natural phenomena. Researchers have found that certain episodes, brainstorms of a kind, occur in the brains of very premature babies and are critical for the maturation of the baby s brain. University of Helsinki researchers have partnered with Swedish and Australian researchers to create a  brainstorm barometer , which allows computers to calculate the brain functions of very premature babies during their first hours of life. The new method is based on the hypothesis that the brainstorms generated by the billions of neurons inside a baby's head are governed by the same rules as other massive natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, forest fires or snow avalanches, tells Dr. Sampsa Vanhatalo who leads the University of Helsinki s Baby Brain Activity (BABA) research group. The biggest risks in the development of a very premature baby are concentrated on the first days of life, when intensive care seeks to find the care balance suitable for each individual child. At this stage it would be vitally important to be able to track the child s brain function and to identify the babies whose brains are at particular risk. The brain function of very premature babies is completely different from that of older children or adults, meaning that the currently used methods of EEG interpretation are poorly suited for them, Vanhatalo explains.   Professor Michael Breakspear s computational neuroscience research group in Australia began to develop mathematical methods used in geology and basic physics research after it was found that the brainstorms in very premature babies were astonishingly similar to the  crackling noise  that occurs on small scales in weakly magnetized metals and large-scales during earthquakes. Of greatest clinical interest was the observation that the results from this barometer correlated significantly with the child's cognitive development at age two, Vanhatalo tells. The EEG instrument created in the study is a collection of sophisticated mathematical functions, combined ingeniously to create a software component for analysing the EEG signal. This component can be added to the software of existing brain monitors. This method is the first source of objective data on the messages the brain of a very premature baby may be sending to the doctors taking care of the child during the first hours of life, Vanhatalo describes. In terms of technology, the adoption of the method is no more difficult than downloading new apps onto our smartphones. The interest of EEG monitor manufacturers to engage in product development will be the bottleneck. Luckily the market is very competitive, Vanhatalo points out.

The conclusion that these drugs are ineffective is however partly based on a misinterpretation of the outcome of the clinical trials once conducted to demonstrate their efficacy. This was the finding of a study conducted by researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy. In recent years, many observers have argued that the most commonly used antidepressant medications, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are ineffective. This criticism has caused authorities in many countries to become increasingly cautious in recommending these medications. One reason for the questioning of the SSRIs has been that many of the clinical trials conducted by the pharmaceutical companies years ago to prove their efficacy failed: critics have thus pointed out that less than half of the studies demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the tested SSRI and placebo. In order to shed further light on this controversial issue, researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy have now analyzed the data from all major company-sponsored placebo-controlled studies addressing the effect of any of three SSRIs   citalopram, sertraline and paroxetine   for major depression in adults. The analyses have been conducted by Ph.D. student Fredrik Hieronymus and others in a research team led by pharmacologist Elias Eriksson.  In order to measure the antidepressant effect, the pharmaceutical companies have unwisely assessed the reduction in the sum score for a large number of symptoms listed on a rating scale. However, the sensitivity of this instrument is markedly marred by the fact that many of these symptoms occur also in subjects without depression, while others are absent also in many depressed patients. For this and other reasons, the usefulness of this rating scale, which was constructed already during the 1950s, has since long been questioned.   We investigated what happens if one instead analyzes the effect of the treatment on the key item of the scale   depressed mood.  According to Elias Eriksson, the results are noteworthy:  Our conclusion is that the questioning of the antidepressant efficacy of SSRIs is to a large extent based on an unfortunate misinterpretation of the available data. The truth is that the scientific support for these drugs exerting an antidepressant impact is very robust across studies , comments Elias Eriksson.

Duke-NUS Associate Professor David Silver co-led two Nature Genetics published studies which showed that mutations in the protein Mfsd2a cause impaired brain development in humans. Mfsd2a is the transporter in the brain for a special type of fat called lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) -- composed of essential fatty acids like omega-3. These studies show, for the first time, the crucial role of these fats in human brain growth and function. In the first study, two families in Libya and Egypt with Mfsd2a mutations were identified with severely reduced brain size, or microcephaly. Their mutations eliminated Mfsd2a's ability to transport LPCs, which meant not enough LPCs were absorbed by the brain. In these families, children affected by these mutations died between one and six years of age. The study not only establishes a link between the transport of LPCs by Mfsd2a and human brain growth and function, it is also the first time a genetic disease has been related to LPC transport in humans. The research was co-led by senior author Professor Joseph Gleeson from Rockefeller University. In a second, separate study, a family in North Pakistan was found to have another type of mutation in the Mfsd2a gene which reduced its transport activity. The individuals with this mutation also had microcephaly, but in this case it was not lethal. However, they did have intellectual disabilities, impaired control of their limbs, and absent speech. Like the first study, findings are proof of the importance of LPCs in brain development and function. The research was co-led by senior author Professor Andrew H. Crosby from Exeter University. In 2014, Dr. Silver published a landmark study in Nature which served as a basis for these two studies. He and his team discovered that Mfsd2a is the transporter for LPCs. Prior to this breakthrough, LPCs were known to be found at high concentrations in our blood but their function was a mystery. Dr. Silver's team showed that mice genetically engineered without Mfsd2a failed to transport LPCs into their brains - which resulted in microcephaly. Since DHA deficiency in animals does not result in microcephaly, this meant that LPCs are critical factors in brain growth and function. Also, while it was previously believed the brain made all the fat it needed, Dr. Silver's research showed that LPCs are transported there from the blood past the blood-brain barrier. His work with Rockefeller and Exeter prove this in humans. ""Our work confirms the essential role of LPCs in brain development and function in humans, and indicates that brain uptake of LPCs during foetal development and in adult life is important,"" said Dr. Silver, co-lead on both studies, based in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Programme at Duke-NUS. ""Now we are studying the functions of LPCs in the brain, and the implications for application are very exciting. We might be able to develop therapeutics in the future that could prevent and treat neurological disorders, and improve brain growth and function. We may even be able to target better brain nutrition for babies, mothers, and the aged.""

This work helps us to see how proteins work, in general,  said Marco Cammarata, who led the experiment at SLAC s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. The research is detailed in Nature Communications. The study focused on myoglobin, a protein that stores oxygen in muscle cells. It is considered a model protein that is sometimes referred to as the  hydrogen atom of biology.  The unique LCLS pulses enabled researches to measure, for the first time at such an ultrafast timescale and under very natural conditions, how the entire protein shook in response to a light-triggered break in a molecular bond. Proteins are a vital part of the body s microscopic machinery. Their movement and shape help determine their function, and studying them is key in designing new drugs to fight disease, for example, and in replicating natural systems to produce new fuel sources. Understanding the natural motion of proteins in response to such basic and essential biochemical reactions as bond breaks could provide insight about a range of biological processes. Scientists had previously seen some evidence of a quaking motion in a bacterial protein jarred by much higher energies, and had also observed myoglobin motion at longer timescales. In the LCLS experiment they triggered the quake by attaching carbon monoxide molecules to the myoglobin and then breaking this bond with a light pulse. They then hit the samples with LCLS x-rays, and varied the timing of the x-rays to view the triggered motion. Within a fraction of a picosecond, or trillionth of a second, after the bond broke, a quake-like wave rolled across the entire protein, causing it to stretch out. The rapid expansion, which researchers precisely measured from the scattering of ultrabright x-rays that hit the samples, was followed by a vigorous shaking, like rustling leaves on a jounced tree limb. They found that this quake-like effect, which had its  epicenter  at an iron atom at the core of the protein, dies off after just a few picoseconds. Based on their x-ray observations of the expansion and oscillations, researchers are working on a 3-D model detailing the protein s motion. The way the protein responds to the shaking motion could provide clues to how myoglobin functions in the body.  This could suggest how the protein opens up channels to let oxygen in and out,  said Henrik Lemke, an LCLS staff scientist who participated in the experiment. A similar oxygen-release process occurs in photosynthesis. Cammarata said follow-up experiments, using a combination of x-ray techniques, will help determine whether more complex proteins, including other metal-containing proteins, exhibit the same kind of response as myoglobin.  We ll be able to see if this type of quaking is a feature common to other proteins, too,  he said.","Published: May 26, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/fishing-for-insight-194704,FISHing for Insight Improved imaging illuminates chromosomes in detail  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Geneticists just got a new pair of glasses. By improving an imaging technology called FISH, they ve made it possible to view genetic material in more detail than ever before. One modification achieves  super resolution  imaging. The other can distinguish maternal from paternal chromosomes. What the researchers are starting to see promises to help them better understand how DNA gets packaged into chromosomes, how that structure relates to health and disease, what the biological significance may be when genetic material is inherited from one parent versus the other and more.  Geneticists have looked at chromosomes for over a century, but they ve longed for higher resolution and an easier and more affordable strategy for looking at any part of any genome, not just the most accessible regions,  said Ting Wu, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and senior author of the study, published in Nature Communications.  With this new technology, we ve enabled significant steps forward in all those regards.   Scientists have a lot of models where we draw in cartoon form what we think is happening,  said the study s first author, Brian Beliveau, who conducted the work as a graduate student in the Wu lab.  When a region of the genome is silenced, we draw it as compacted. When a gene is expressed, we draw it as more open or active. But we don t actually know yet what any of these look like.   Now we have a tool to start looking at this systematically, which is very exciting,  said Beliveau, currently a research fellow in the lab of HMS associate professor of systems biology Peng Yin at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Teach a person to FISH  FISH, short for fluorescence in situ hybridization, is a decades-old visualization technique that locates and illuminates specific genes in the nuclei of cells. Scientists use FISH to find out things like how many chromosomes a person has or where a particular gene is located on a chromosome. But conventional FISH has its limits, and scientists want to look closer. For instance, it hasn t been able to show the details of how chromosomes are folded, whether there are different ways of folding or how two genome segments interact all of which would help elucidate how our bodies work. Researchers have had some success getting high-resolution FISH images of small segments of the genome. But the cost to look at such questions genome-wide has been  beyond anybody s purse,  said Wu.  The flexibility to target a specific region on the genome has been very difficult also.  In 2012, Beliveau devised an enhancement to FISH called Oligopaint that made this possible at low cost. Traditional FISH works by attaching a fluorescent tag to a short, single strand of DNA called a probe, which has a sequence complementary to the segment of DNA a researcher wants to study. When released into a cell, the probe binds to the desired sequence in the nucleus and lights it up so it can be seen under a microscope. A limiting factor to scaling up FISH has been that  it s a ton of work to try to find those sequences in nature to make the necessary DNA probes and isolate them in a way that would be compatible with the tool,  said Beliveau. He solved the problem by developing computer software that lets scientists design the probes they need and then build them with synthetic components hundreds or thousands at a time. Super resolution In the new paper, Beliveau taught Oligopaint two new tricks. First, he paired it up with two other technologies STORM from the lab of Xiaowei Zhuang at Harvard University, and DNA-PAINT from Peng Yin s lab to zoom in on chromosomes at  super resolution.  The DNA double helix is about 2 nanometers wide. When it gets wound around a bundle called a nucleosome, one of the simplest building blocks of chromosomes, it grows to about 10 nanometers. Since conventional microscopy can resolve images to only about 200 to 300 nanometers, it s been impossible to see such infinitesimal structures. The new Oligopaint combinations can bring chromosomes into focus down to about 20 nanometers. That s possible because each DNA probe is able to bind to a second probe; the resulting fluorescent output blinks, enabling researchers to distinguish the fluorescent tags one at a time and achieve a finer resolution.  This is an unprecedented level of detail,  said Wu.  Right now when you do FISH on structures below a certain size, you get a spot,  said Beliveau.  With these technologies, we re seeing interesting shapes and structures, loops and protrusions, start to drop out of these things.  Wu, Beliveau and their colleagues have already begun to find  intriguing organizational themes  in the chromatin of mammalian and fruit fly cells. But they consider the current paper mostly a proof of concept.  The goal is to communicate these techniques to the research community as quickly as possible so everyone can start making discoveries,  said Beliveau. They hope researchers generate  a huge bolus of images  that will reveal more about what our genetic structure looks like, Wu added.  Of course, naturally, if we get down to 20 nanometers then people will want 10 nanometers, and then 5,  she said wryly. Distinguishing mom from dad We normally inherit our chromosomes pairs: one from our mother and one from our father. The second trick Beliveau taught Oligopaint was to tell them apart.  This was not thought possible but, to our surprise, our technology managed to break this barrier too,  said Wu. Beliveau modified his Oligopaint probes so they could detect the presence or absence of the many single nucleotide variants, or SNPs, that distinguish maternal from paternal chromosomes. As long as researchers know which SNPs to look for and have hundreds or thousands of them to target just a few isn t enough Oligopaint can now light up a chromosome to identify  mom  or  dad.  Wu, for one, is excited to use this new ability to study things like how one of two X chromosomes gets inactivated in female mammals. It s also become clear to scientists that maternal and paternal genes don t behave the same way, and that this might have effects on human health and disease. Wu is particularly interested in Down syndrome, in which children inherit three instead of two copies of chromosome 21.  I d love to look at a cell and ask, are two copies from the mother?

Daniel Wall, a UW associate professor in the Department of Molecular Biology, and others were able to show that damaged sustained by the outer membrane (OM) of a myxobacteria cell population was repaired by a healthy population using the process of OME. The research revealed that these social organisms benefit from group behavior that endows favorable fitness consequences among kin cells. Wall says, to the research group s knowledge, this is the first evidence that a bacterium can use cell-content sharing to repair damaged siblings.  It is analogous to how a wound in your body can be healed,  Wall says.  When your body is wounded, your cells can coordinate their functions to heal the damaged tissue.  Chris Vassallo, a UW doctoral student in molecular biology and originally from Cheyenne, was the paper s lead author and conducted most of the lab experiments.  During nutrient depletion, myxobacteria cooperate to build a macroscopic structure called a fruiting body,  Vassallo says.  The structure resembles a tree or mushroom in appearance.  A fruiting body is essentially a multicellular organism that produces dormant spores that are resistant to environmental stresses. These myxobacterial cells, in their native environments, must cope with factors that compromise the integrity of the cell, Wall says. Rather than looking out only for themselves like other bacterial species, the individual myxobacteria cells band together as a social group to assist their kin that become damaged.  Myxobacteria are unusual for bacteria in that they have a true multicellular life,  Wall says.  Researchers are interested in how the evolutionary transition occurred toward multi-cellularity; that is, how cooperation develops and single cells are not just interested in themselves. The Darwinian view is that each individual is out for themselves;  survival of the fittest.   When environmental cells come together, they compete with each other,  Wall continues.  With OME, we think it allows myxobacteria cells to transition from a heterogeneous single cellular life to a more harmonious multicellular life.  While the practical application of the science is to better understand how single cells can evolve to multicellular cells to be cooperative, Vassallo says the research could possibly have future real-world implications for treating infections in humans.  The most direct applicability could be for antibiotic resistance,  Wall says.  Within the paper, Chris did an experiment where one strain of myxobacteria conferred antibiotic resistance to another strain. This works by the cells transferring their OM armor.  The human skin protects the body and internal cells from environmental stresses. By analogy, bacteria protect themselves with their OM, and they are known to change their armor in response to stress. When they chemically change their armor, they can also change their antibiotic resistance profile. ","Published: May 26, 2015"

You might be able to discern a hint of strawberry or the tang of yogurt. But overall it tastes like a blend of indiscernible ingredients. Now imagine that the smoothie is made of 20,000 ground-up cells from, say, the brain. You could run tests to determine what molecules are in the sample, which is what scientists do now. That would certainly give you useful information, but it wouldn t tell you which cells those molecules originally came from. It would provide only an average cell profile for the whole smoothie. And when it comes to the tissues in our bodies, averages are almost always misleading. Just as you know there isn t an  average  food called strawbanaspinach-orangegurt, scientists know there isn t just one cell type in the brain.  If you take a hunk of tissue and grind it up and analyze the RNA, you have no idea if it represents what every cell in that population is doing or what no cell in the population is doing,  said Marc Kirschner, the John Franklin Enders University Professor of Systems Biology and chair of the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School.  Imagine if you had a population of men and women. If you assume everyone is an average of men and women, you [probably] wouldn t represent a single person in that population.  The trouble is, it s expensive, time-consuming and tricky to characterize tissues one cell, or cell type, at a time. Kirschner and Steven McCarroll, assistant professor of genetics at HMS, reported this week in separate papers that their labs have developed high-throughput techniques to quickly, easily and inexpensively give every cell in a sample a unique genetic barcode before it goes into the blender. As a result, scientists can analyze complex tissues by profiling each individual cell no averaging required.  Different cells in a tissue use the same genome in amazingly diverse ways: to engineer specialized cell shapes, accomplish diverse feats of physiology, and mount distinct functional responses to the same stimulus. These techniques will finally let science understand how biological systems operate at that single-cell level,  said McCarroll, who is also director of genetics for the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT.  We are so excited about the work ahead.  To make their tools, both teams collaborated with David Weitz, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a pioneer in the field of microfluidics. The teams expect that their techniques will equip biologists to discover and classify cell types in the body in much greater depth, map cell diversity in complex tissues such as the brain, better understand stem cell differentiation and gain more insights into the genetics of disease. Evan Macosko and Allon Klein met in a microfluidics class a few years ago. Then they went their separate ways. Unbeknownst to each other, they decided to develop methods to answer the same question: How could they obtain gene expression profiles for thousands of individual cells to better understand the complexity of gene expression within a tissue? Gene expression the pattern of gene activity in a particular cell underlies every process in biology, from cognition in the brain to development in the egg. Scientists have known for 50 years that gene expression varies from cell to cell like a fingerprint, making skin cells different from liver cells and making some liver cells different from others. But they haven t been able to measure it efficiently at the single-cell level in samples with many cell types. Macosko, HMS instructor in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Stanley Neuroscience Fellow in the McCarroll lab, came up with a technique he called Drop-seq. Klein, assistant professor of systems biology at HMS, devised a method he called indexing droplets for sequencing, orinDrops. Last fall, they learned about each other s work through the scientific conference circuit.  It was kind of like meeting your doppelg nger,  said Macosko.  He had been thinking about the same things I had for two years. Human beings have different ways of solving problems, and it was really cool to see how he did it.  The teams each developed ways of using tiny beads to deliver vast numbers of different DNA barcodes into hundreds of thousands of nanometer-sized water droplets simultaneously. Thanks to Weitz s expertise, both methods were able to use microfluidic devices to co-encapsulate cells in these droplets along with the beads. The droplets get created in a tiny assembly line, streaming along a channel the width of a human hair. The bead barcodes get attached to the genes in each cell, so that scientists can sequence the genes all in one batch and still trace each gene back to the cell it came from. Macosko and Klein make their beads in different ways. The droplets get broken up at different steps in the process. Other aspects of the chemistry diverge. But the result is the same. After running a single batch of cells through Drop-seq or inDrops, scientists  can see which genes are expressed in the entire sample and can sort by each individual cell,  said Klein. They can then use computer software to uncover patterns in the mix, including which cells have similar gene expression profiles. That provides a way to classify what cell types were in the original tissue and to possibly discover new ones. Current methods allow researchers to generate 96 single-cell expression profiles in a day for several thousand dollars. Drop-seq, by comparison, enables 10,000 profiles a day for 6.5 cents each.  If you re a biologist with an interesting question in mind, this approach could shine a light on the problem without bankrupting you,  said Macosko.  It finally makes gene expression profiling on a cell-by-cell level tractable and accessible. I think it s something biologists in a lot of fields will want to use.  Rather than competing with each other, the teams believe that having two options available in Drop-seq and inDrops will benefit the scientific community.  Each method has unique elements that makes it better for different applications. Biologists will be able to choose which one is most appropriate for them,  said Macosko. McCarroll, Macosko and their colleagues are excited to explore the brain with Drop-seq. With luck, that will include discovering new cell types, constructing a global architecture of those cell types in the brain and understanding brain development and function as they relate to disease. Among the questions they want to pursue are: What are all the cell types that make the brain work? How do these cell types vary in their functions and responses to stimuli? What cell populations are missing or malfunctioning in schizophrenia, autism and other disorders of the brain? Classifying cell types may not sound exciting, said Joshua Sanes, the Jeff C. Tarr Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Paul J. Finnegan Family Director of the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University and a co-author of the Drop-seq paper, but it lays the foundation for mapping neuronal circuits and one day being able to probe the mystery of how the  wetware  of the brain gives rise to thoughts, emotions and behaviors. In the shorter term, Sanes looks forward to completing a catalog of cell types in the mouse retina. Drop-seq has already revealed several new ones. Kirschner, Klein and their colleagues, meanwhile, are keenly interested in other areas, including stem cell development.  Does a population of cells that we initially think is uniform actually have some substructure?  Klein wants to know; he s trying to find out by studying immune cells and different kinds of adult stem cells.  What is the nature of an early developing stem cell? What endows those cells with a pluripotent state? Is gene expression more plastic or does it have a well-defined state that s different from a more mature cell? How is its fate determined?  Using inDrops, Klein and team have confirmed prior findings that suggest even embryonic stem cells are not uniform. They found previously undiscovered cell types in the population they studied, as well as cells in intermediate stages that they suspect are converting from one type to another. Although both teams are excited by the massive amounts of data they and other researchers will obtain from Drop-seq and inDrops, they realize the sheer volume of information poses a problem as well.  We have thousands of cells expressing tens of thousands of genes. We can t look in 20,000 directions to pick out interesting features,  said Klein. Machine learning is able to do some of that, and the teams have already employed new statistical techniques. Still, Kirschner has called on mathematicians and computer scientists to develop new ideas about how to analyze and extract useful information about our biology from the mountains of data that are on the horizon.","Published: May 26, 2015"

That the Anglo-Saxon recipe, which includes wine, garlic, and bile from a cow s stomach, could hold the key to defeating MRSA came about after a chance discussion between experts at the University of Nottingham last year. During a meeting of academics interested in infectious diseases, Dr Christina Lee, an expert in Old English, told microbiologists about Bald s Leechbook   an Anglo-Saxon medical textbook kept in the British Library which contains remedies for treating infections and other ailments. Dr Lee translated a recipe for treating styes   an infection of an eyelash usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus - and the past year has seen researchers painstakingly recreate it and test it on MRSA. The thousand-year-old remedy has proven to be an  incredibly potent  antibiotic, according to lead researcher Dr Freya Harrison, a microbiologist from the University of Nottingham. The individual ingredients alone did not have any measurable effect but when combined according to the ancient text, they killed up to 90 per cent of MRSA bacteria in infected mice. And in infections grown in the laboratory, only about one bacterial cell in a thousand survived.  I still can t quite believe how well this one thousand year old antibiotic actually seems to be working, when we got the first results we were just utterly dumbfounded. We did not see this coming at all,  commented Dr Harrison.  Modern research into disease can benefit from past responses and knowledge, which is largely contained in non-scientific writings. But the potential of these texts to contribute to addressing the challenges cannot be understood without the combined expertise of both the arts and science,  commented Dr Lee.  Dr Kendra Rumbaugh, a microbiologist at Texas Tech University who was part of the research team, commented:  These types of wound infections are very difficult to treat, and given that most of the agents we have previously tested displayed little to no efficacy, I was quite skeptical. However, this  ancient  solution performed better than the current  gold standard  (vancomycin) and killed more than 90% of the MRSA in the wounds. ","Published: May 26, 2015"

Researchers have created a special enzyme that can shear off the substances on red blood cells that are responsible for potentially fatal immune reactions if a patient receives the wrong type of blood, according to a new study. The enzyme is not yet effective enough to allow for large-scale processing to convert type A or type B blood into type O, said lead author David Kwan, a postdoctoral fellow of chemistry at the University of British Columbia's Centre for Blood Research in Vancouver, Canada. ""We're not there yet. This is really a step towards that,"" Kwan said. ""The big thing is that we've shown that it's feasible to improve these enzymes."" The effect of a technology that could convert any blood type to the universal donor type O would be ""transformational"" for the world's blood supplies, said Dr. Richard Benjamin, chief medical officer for the American Red Cross. Blood banks tend to lean heavily on donors who are type O, particularly if their blood also is RH-negative, Benjamin said. Type O, RH-negative blood can be used by anyone, regardless of their blood type. About 11 percent of hospital transfusions involve donated type O, RH-negative blood, even though only about 6 percent of the population carries that specific blood type, Benjamin said. ""We are in constant short supply of that type, and we are frequently going to those donors and asking them to give blood,"" Benjamin said. ""We've pestered them a lot, actually."" Blood types are determined by antigens, which are sugars on the surface of red blood cells. These antigens can cause an immune system reaction if a person's body recognizes them as foreign, and that's why a person with blood containing type A antigens cannot donate to a person with type B blood. A process that uses enzymes to strip away these antigens has been around for about 15 years, Benjamin said, but until now the process has not proven effective enough. Clinical trials from the early 2000s found that blood treated with the enzymes still contained enough antigens to produce a muted immune response. Kwan and his colleagues performed directed evolution on the enzyme, generating mutant versions and selecting the ones that did the best job of stripping away blood antigens. In just five generations, the enzyme became 170 times more effective -- not yet effective enough to solve the problem, the researchers said, but improved enough to show that the process of improving the enzyme does work. ""We're not ready to use this on a practical clinical scale yet,"" Kwan said. ""You need to nearly completely remove all of the antigens. We can get most of them off of the blood cells, but if you have a mismatched blood type you still will have an immune reaction."" It will take years at least to develop the enzyme enough to create type O blood from type A or type B, he said. And once they have an optimized system for converting blood, they will need to go through clinical trials in the United States and get a license from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Benjamin said. ""If they're not in the clinic yet, that's a five- to 10-year horizon,"" he said. Once perfected, the same process might also be turned toward helping bodies accept other donations, such as organ transplants, Kwan said. ""These same antigens we're trying to cleave off of red blood cells are also present on other tissues and organs that can be transplanted,"" he said. However, there is one big difference -- organs are living tissues, and they might regenerate any antigens that can be stripped by the enzymatic process, Kwan said.","Published: May 26, 2015"

The therapy, involving infusions of stem cells, was found to provide pain relief and to reduce the severity of this skin condition for which no cure currently exists. The clinical trial, led by King s College London in collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), recruited 10 children with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). RDEB is a painful skin disease in which very minor skin injury leads to blisters and poorly healing wounds. About 1,000 people in the UK live with RDEB. The fragile skin in RDEB also scars, develops contractures and is prone to life-shortening skin cancers. There is currently no cure for RDEB. The Phase I/II EBSTEM trial, funded by the Sohana Research Fund with donations from Goldman Sachs Gives, tested the safety of the treatment and also sought to establish whether it could help to reduce the severity of the disease and improve quality of life for these patients.  During the first six months of the trial, participants were given three infusions of mesenchymal stromal cells (stem cells) grown from the bone marrow of unrelated donors. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to home to wounded tissue and mediate wound healing in previous studies. Although the cells do not survive permanently, they may still deliver clinical benefits. The children were then monitored for a year after the cell infusions. A range of monitoring tests showed no serious adverse effects in patients who received the therapy. The pain score (level of pain) reported was on average lower than before treatment, and the severity of the condition was also reported to have lessened following the infusions. Parents also reported better wound healing, less skin redness and fewer blisters. Overall, the paper concludes that the outcomes of the trial are promising, although this is an unblinded study of participants which may introduce a positive bias in the information reported. In interviews families reported a range of benefits from having better sleep, a parent being able to return to work part-time because of reduced caring needs, and a family being able to plan their first vacation together.  However, further work is needed to better understand the mechanisms involved   for example, whether the stem cells trigger the production of a variety of growth factors and cytokines   immune system regulators - to stimulate wound healing and reduce inflammation in the skin. Further studies are also needed to confirm the efficacy of the treatment and establish the optimal dose of cells to give RDEB patients.  Dr Gabriela Petrof, lead author from St John's Institute of Dermatology at King s College London, said:  We found that wound healing improved in all 10 children and the skin was less inflamed. Many of the kids also mentioned their skin was less painful and itchy, and their parents noted how much more energetic they were.  Professor John McGrath, senior author from St John's Institute of Dermatology at King s College London and honorary consultant dermatologist at Guy s and St Thomas  NHS Foundation Trust, added:  In 25 years of my research on RDEB, this is the only time I have seen any treatment change the nature of the condition. The outcomes are truly impressive and injecting the MSCs raised no safety concerns. At the same time, it s important to note that this is not a cure and that the benefits wear off after about six months.   Moving forward, we are now starting to introduce repeated infusions of MSCs into routine NHS clinical care. But we are also starting new clinical trials   combining cell and gene therapy to give patients with RDEB, children and adults, even better treatments as we search for a cure for this devastating inherited skin condition.  Dr Anna Martinez, principal investigator from Great Ormond Street Hospital, said:  Giving the cells is straightforward, but we now have to fine tune the optimal dose and interval between infusions whilst work continues on more long term-therapies.  The study was also supported by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London.","Published: May 26, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/3d-for-topdown-proteomics-extra-dimension-for-more-proteins-184484, D for Top Down Proteomics  Extra Dimension for More Proteins Researchers from the University of Wisconsin  Madison have tested the possible applications of adding a  third dimension  to chromatography   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The two contrasting procedures for discovering and identifying proteins in biological samples are known as the bottom-up and the top-down approaches. In the former, the mixture of proteins in the sample is treated with enzymes that break them up into their constituent peptides and the whole mixture is analysed by mass spectrometry. Although there are now some efficient methods for carrying this out, the production of so many peptides inevitably complicates protein identification. The alternative approach is top-down, in which the proteins are analysed intact. To go down this route, most methods require a high degree of separation so that the individual proteins can be analysed separately by mass spectrometry. This is not without its challenges such as the incompatibility of the conventional buffers towards mass spectrometry and the poor overall resolution of some of the chromatographic procedures. Ying Ge and colleagues from University of Wisconsin-Madison noted that all published separation protocols for mixtures of intact proteins involve up to two consecutive chromatographic steps and decided to see what difference a third dimension would make. They were encouraged by their earlier work using hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) in which they identified ammonium tartrate as a novel salt which was compatible with mass spectrometry. The three types of chromatography that they tested were HIC, ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) and reversed-phase chromatography (RPC). The latter two are often used together in conventional 2D-LC protocols for protein separation. For IEC a mixed-bed column containing equal amounts of weak cation-exchange and anion-exchange materials was employed as this type is known to provide better separation than a single-mode column. The three separations were deployed in the order IEC, HIC and RPC and there were solid operational reasons for doing so. In IEC, there is an increasing salt gradient in the mobile phase during the separation and the relatively high final concentration is suitable for the start of the HIC run during which a high salt concentration is lowered. Coupling of HIC with RPC is a well-established protocol. Using a tissue cell lysate, a 2D approach using IEC-RPC was compared with a 3D IEC-HIC-RPC approach, in which identical IEC and RPC/MS conditions were chosen in each method to aid the comparison. In the 2D method, one particular IEC fraction was examined closely and it revealed some coeluting proteins when it was analysed by RPC/MS. However, in the 3D method, this same fraction was chromatographed by HIC to give 35 separate fractions, each of which was then analysed by RPC/MS. The overlapping proteins from the 2D process were now clearly separated and some additional proteins were detected that were not seen after 2D separation. When the number of proteins identified using tandem mass spectrometry was taken into account, the improved performance of the 3D method was clear. The 35 HIC fractions produced from the IEC fraction yielded a total of 640 intact proteins. Some of the proteins were present in more than one fraction so the actual number of individual proteins with no repeats was 201. The same IEC fraction analysed in the 2D approach by IEC-RPC/MS yielded only 47 proteins. Using longer gradients had some effect, taking the total number of non-redundant proteins from 47 with an 80-minute gradient to 63 and 67 with 3-hour and 7-hour gradients, respectively, but well short of the identification power of the 3D method. Although the performance of the 3D system is good, the researchers said that it could become much better for several reasons. Firstly, the majority of the proteins identified had molecular masses lower than 30 kDa even though an initial SDS-PAGE screening had revealed larger ones. The failure was attributed to limitations in the mass spectrometer, particularly the falling signal-to-noise ratio with increasing mass. Initial separation of the high-molecular-mass proteins from those of lower mass by SEC would also help. Secondly, it is well known that offline chromatography like that used in this system is susceptible to protein losses and switching to a fully online process would cut out the losses and increase sensitivity. In addition, it would be more informative if all 35 IEC fractions were analysed subsequently by HIC-RPC/MS, but there often has to be a trade off between the extra information gained and the time that it would take. Combining some fractions would speed up the overall analysis time but lose some of the separation power. However, even without any of these improvements, the 3D method provides a vast improvement over the 2D method for protein separation from biological samples and will help to expose new biomarkers of disease as hidden proteins come to light.","Published: May 26, 2015"

While the publications were the first to result from the ongoing, NIH Common Fund project, the extensive gene expression data amassed thus far by GTEx has been publicly available to scientists worldwide and is empowering research across biological disciplines   particularly in the cancer field.  If you look at the people who have downloaded the dbGaP data   our raw data for gene expression analyses   by far the single largest group using the resource is cancer researchers,  says Kristin Ardlie, director and co-principal investigator of the GTEx Laboratory Data Analysis and Coordination Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The GTEx data, which to date has been drawn from roughly 10,000 tissue samples sequenced from 43 different tissue types, reveals how variants in the four-letter genetic code of DNA influence gene expression in the context of different tissues throughout the body. These variants can influence how and when a gene is turned on or off, or to what degree a gene is expressed in a given tissue. For genes in protein-coding regions of the genome, those variants can also influence how much of a protein is produced and which isoforms (or, types of the same protein) are present. Since these variations affect gene activity and cell function, they could be at play when something goes wrong, leading to diseases such as cancer. That s why researchers are mining the GTEx data to explore the possible connections between genetics and disease. Gad Getz, Ardlie s co-PI, is director of both the Broad s Cancer Genome Computational Analysis group and the Bioinformatics Program at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Department of Pathology. He says that, in the field of cancer research, scientists are taking a variety of approaches to using GTEx data in their investigations of the disease.  People are playing with different ideas about how to use this expression data in cancer research,  he says.  One way is to use GTEx as a resource in comparisons between normal and cancer cells. GTEx can serve as a control for what normal cell activity should look like; it can give you not just the level of gene expression, but also insights about which gene isoforms are expressed in different cells and tissue types in the body.  That data can then be juxtaposed with gene expression data from tumor samples, with the differences between the  normal  GTEx samples and the cancer samples pointing to biological mechanisms that might be underlying the disease. For many types of cancer, these comparisons were previously hard to get.  Historically, cancer studies have often tried to make these comparisons between tumor and normal cells, but getting samples from inaccessible organs such as the brain or lung is not something that can usually be done,  Ardlie explains. In such studies,  normal  cells have traditionally been sampled from areas adjacent to tumors, but there has always been some question as to whether that tissue was pre-cancerous, and therefore not truly representative of  normal,  healthy tissue. Having data from the large pool of samples from the GTEx project provides a reliable baseline for comparison. Another use for the GTEx data, Getz says, is to  clean-up  data from cancer samples. When a tumor is biopsied, the result is a mixture of cells: cancer cells, healthy cells, and others that may be somewhere in between.  You can use the GTEx data as a filter to computationally remove the background noise caused by the expression data from the normal cells,  Getz explains. This  normal  data can also show when genes that are typically expressed are not being expressed in cancer samples. The GTEx data can also point to which tissues are relevant to a specific type of cancer, and can point to possible risk alleles   genetic variants that raise or lower one s risk of getting cancer. Currently, GTEx data is being used broadly by researchers from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies to probe the links between genetics and disease and to investigate possible therapeutic avenues. Those efforts are expected to be aided by refinements to the methods researchers are using to analyze GTEx data, and by increased availability of tools such as Broad s Firehose, a computational system that enables fast, high-throughput analysis of large datasets using many complex algorithms at once.

The strains have led to the culling of millions of commercial chickens and turkeys as well as the death of hundreds of people. The new vaccine development method is expected to help researchers make vaccines for emerging strains of avian influenza more quickly. This could reduce the number and intensity of large-scale outbreaks at poultry farms as well as curb human transmission. It also may lead to new influenza vaccines for pigs, and novel vaccines for sheep and other livestock, said J rgen Richt, Regents distinguished professor of veterinary medicine and director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases. Richt and his colleagues focused on the avian influenza virus subtype H5N1, a new strain most active in Indonesia, Egypt and other Southeast Asian and North African countries. H5N1 also has been documented in wild birds in the U.S., though in fewer numbers. ""H5N1 is a zoonotic pathogen, which means that it is transmitted from chickens to humans,"" Richt said. ""So far it has infected more than 700 people worldwide and has killed about 60 percent of them. Unfortunately, it has a pretty high mortality rate."" Researchers developed a vaccine for H5N1 by combining two viruses. A vaccine strain of the Newcastle disease virus, a virus that naturally affects poultry, was cloned and a small section of the H5N1 virus was transplanted into the Newcastle disease virus vaccine, creating a recombinant virus. Tests showed that the new recombinant virus vaccinated chickens against both Newcastle disease virus and H5N1. Researchers also looked at the avian flu subtype H7N9, an emerging zoonotic strain that has been circulating in China since 2013. China has reported about 650 cases in humans and Canada has reported two cases in people returning from China. About 230 people have died from H7N9. ""In Southeast Asia there are a lot of markets that sell live birds that people can buy and prepare at home,"" Richt said. ""In contrast to the H5N1 virus that kills the majority of chickens in three to five days, chickens infected with the H7N9 virus do not show clinical signs of sickness. That means you could buy a bird that looks perfectly healthy but could be infected. If an infected bird is prepared for consumption, there is a high chance you could get sick, and about 1 in 3 infected people die."" Using the same method for developing the H5N1 vaccine, researchers inserted a small section of the H7N9 virus into the Newcastle disease virus vaccine. Chickens given this recombinant vaccine were protected against the Newcastle disease virus and H7N9. ""We believe this Newcastle disease virus concept works very well for poultry because you kill two birds with one stone, metaphorically speaking,"" Richt said. ""You use only one vector to vaccinate and protect against a selected virus strain of avian influenza."" Using the Newcastle disease virus for vaccine development may extend beyond poultry to pigs, cattle and sheep, Richt said. Researchers found they were able to protect pigs against an H3 influenza strain by using the Newcastle disease virus to develop a recombinant virus vaccine. Wenjun Ma, Kansas State University assistant professor of diagnostic medicine and pathobiology, is building on this finding and using the Newcastle disease virus to make a vaccine for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a disease that has killed an estimated 6 million pigs.  Richt conducted the avian influenza study with Ma, Adolfo Garcia-Sastre at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, and several other colleagues. They published their findings in the Journal of Virology study, ""Newcastle disease virus-vectored H7 and H5 live vaccines protect chickens from challenge with H7N9 or H5N1 avian influenza viruses."" It is the first study to look at an H7N9 vaccine in chickens, the animals the disease originates in.  ","Published: May 26, 2015"

The team created thriving strains of genetically engineered yeast using human genes and found that certain groups of genes are surprisingly stable over evolutionary time. The research, published May 22 in the journal Science, paves the way for using humanized yeast to better understand genetic disorders and to screen drugs for treating the diseases. Although yeast consist of a single cell and humans have trillions of cells organized into complex systems, we share thousands of similar genes. Of those, about 450 are critical for yeast s survival, so researchers removed the yeast version of each one and replaced it with the human version and waited to see whether the yeast would die. Creating hundreds of new strains of yeast, each with a single human gene, resulted in many newly engineered strains   nearly half, in fact   that could survive and reproduce after having human genes swapped in for their ordinary ones. ""Cells use a common set of parts and those parts, even after a billion years of independent evolution, are swappable,"" said Edward Marcotte, professor in the university's Department of Molecular Biosciences and co-director of the Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology (CSSB).  It's a beautiful demonstration of the common heritage of all living things   to be able to take DNA from a human and replace the matching DNA in a yeast cell and have it successfully support the life of the cell."" The work has applications for human health in that some genetic diseases caused by mutations could be tested in new ways. Future studies might compare different strains of humanized yeast, each with slightly different versions of the same human gene, to better understand how certain mutations affect a person's health. Researchers also could insert precise versions of a human gene mutation into yeast and then expose the yeast to different drugs to test new therapies. ""We could find out if one of the standard treatments would work on your particular version of the gene or if maybe another drug would be even better,"" says Claus Wilke, a professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and co-author of the paper. Marcotte speculates that there might be another 1,000 or so pairs of swappable genes between humans and yeast. Along with the approximately 200 swappable genes already identified, these might be useful in searching for drugs to treat a host of human genetic diseases. This kind of gene swap experiment between humans and yeast has been done for single genes before, but this is the first large-scale study to swap hundreds of gene pairs. The large number of tests allowed team member Jon Laurent, a graduate student in the CSSB and co-author of the paper, to look for underlying rules for what makes a gene swappable. Surprisingly, the best predictor of whether two genes could be successfully swapped was not how similar their genetic sequences were, but rather which modules they were part of. A module is a group of genes that work together to do something useful, such as produce cholesterol to build cell walls. All the genes from the same module tended either to be swappable between humans and yeast, or not. ""This work is basically showing that you can take a fuel injector from a tractor and swap it for a fuel injector in your Toyota and it will still work, more or less, because they're both fuel injectors,"" Marcotte said. ""The exciting part is that we can now use this information to swap entire systems involving dozens of genes at a time and ask if that system works as well as the natural system in yeast,"" says Aashiq Kachroo, postdoctoral researcher in the CSSB and co-author of the paper. ""That will be fascinating because now we won't be just looking at a gene, but 30 different genes from a human in a simple cell."" In addition to Marcotte, Wilke, Kachroo and Laurent, the paper's other co-authors are: Christopher Yellman, research associate in the CSSB; and Austin Meyer, postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.

There are different explanations for how these resistances are transferred. Researchers from the Vetmeduni Vienna found phages in chicken meat that are able to transfer antimicrobial resistance to bacteria. Phages are viruses that exclusively infect bacteria and are therefore harmless to humans. However, phages can contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. These findings are not only relevant for the food industry but also for medicine. The study was published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria poses a global threat to public health. Common antibiotics are often ineffective in treating infectious diseases because pathogens acquire resistance genes. These antimicrobial resistance genes are obtained in different ways.  The most frequent way is the transfer via mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, or via transposons, the so-called jumping genes,  explains Friederike Hilbert, scientist at the Institute of Meat Hygiene at the Vetmeduni Vienna.  Transfer of resistances via phages was thought to play a minor role so far.  Hilbert and her colleagues isolated phages from 50 chicken samples purchased from Austrian supermarkets, street markets and butchers. They found phages in 49 samples.  Phages do not pose a risk to humans because they can only infect bacteria. No other cells or organisms can be infected.  Their analysis showed that one quarter of the phages under study were able to transduce antimicrobial resistance to E. coli bacteria under laboratory conditions. They transduced resistance to kanamycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol. No phage was able to transduce resistance to an extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance (ESBL).  This mechanism could also be important in clinical settings, where multiresistant pathogens are on the rise. We assume that phages acquire resistance genes from already resistant bacteria and then transfer those genes to other bacteria,  says Hilbert.  Our results could explain why resistances spread so rapidly among bacteria.  Catalysts for evolution Scientists have known for a while that phages are able to transduce genes but this was considered a rare event for genes encoding resistance to antibiotics. Newer DNA analyses show, however, that phages leave their signature in bacterial genomes. This way of transfer is presumably more frequent than thought. Phages may therefore play a major role in bacterial evolution. Phages are more robust than bacteria Compared to bacteria, phages are significantly more resistant to disinfectants. Alcohol, in particular, is hardly active against phages.  Common disinfection methods are often inappropriate against phages,  Hilbert underlines. The food industry and also hospitals may choose disinfectants that are active against bacteria, but might be ineffective against phages. Focussing on phage therapy Treating bacterial infections with phages has become a promising alternative combating antimicrobial-resistant pathogens where phages directly combat bacteria. Hilbert recommends to test therapeutic phages for their ability to transfer resistance genes. The combination of phages and multiresistant pathogens could otherwise result in a hazardous cocktail of phages transferring multiresistance genes. ","Published: May 26, 2015"

Yet this photonics advancement   called a metamaterial hyperlens   doesn t climb down stairs. Instead, it improves our ability to see tiny objects. Described in a research paper published by the journal Nature Communications, the hyperlens may someday help detect some of the most lethal forms of cancer. It could also lead to advancements in nanoelectronic manufacturing and boost scientists  ability to examine single molecules   a development with implications in physics, chemistry, biology and other fields.  There is a great need in healthcare, nanotechnology and other areas to improve our ability to see tiny objects that elude even the most powerful optical systems. The hyperlens we are developing is, potentially, a giant step toward solving this problem,  says Natalia Litchinitser, PhD, professor of electrical engineering at the University at Buffalo and the paper s lead author. Co-authors are Jingbo Sun, PhD, assistant research professor of electrical engineering at UB, and Mikhail I. Shalaev, a PhD candidate in Litchintser s lab. Conventional optical systems, such as microscopes and cameras, are limited by diffraction, a phenomena in which light bends as it passes around an edge or through a slit. An example of this are the closely spaced tracks of a DVD, which form a rainbow pattern when looking at the disk. Diffraction sets a fundamental limit to the resolution of optical systems. Scientists are working to solve diffraction with metamaterials, which are materials engineered to have properties not yet discovered in nature. Typically, the materials are arranged in repetitive patterns, often smaller in scale than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Metamaterial hyperlenses overcome the diffraction limit by transforming decaying evanescent waves into propagating waves. Once converted, the former decaying waves, which were commonly lost in conventional imaging, can be collected and transmitted using standard optical components. Some of the first metamaterial hyperlenses consisted of tiny concentric rings of silver and dielectric (an insulating material). However, this design only works within a narrow range of wavelengths and it suffers from large losses of resonance. Instead of concentric rings, UB researchers formed tiny slivers of gold and PMMA (a transparent thermoplastic) into a radial shape. The design of this metamaterial hyperlens, which looks like a Slinky suspended in motion, overcomes the diffraction limit in visible frequency range. Moreover, it can be integrated with an optical waveguide, opening the door to hyperlens-based medical endoscopes. More studies are required, but such a tool could improve doctors  ability to detect some of the most lethal forms of cancer, such as ovarian cancer. For example, today s high-resolution endoscopes can resolve objects to about 10,000 nanometers. The hyperlens could improve that to at least 250 nanometers or better. This is important because the earlier doctors are able to discover hard-to-find cancers, the more success they have treating the disease. Another potential application centers on optical nanolithography, the process of passing light through a mask to a pattern on polymer film. Continuous improvement in this field is essential to building the next generation of optoelectronic devices, data storage drives, sensors and other gadgets. The hyperlens also show promise in sequencing single molecules, a potential advancement with broad implications in numerous fields of research including physics, chemistry and biology. The research was supported by grants from the U.S. Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation.","Published: May 26, 2015"

The researchers, led by Arul Chinnaiyan, M.D., Ph.D., and Charles L. Sawyers, M.D., co-leaders of the Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer Foundation Dream Team, sequenced the DNA and RNA of tumor biopsy samples from 150 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, an advanced cancer that has stopped responding to standard hormone-based therapies. This is the first major analysis of this common and aggressive type of cancer in a clinical context. The study is published in Cell. Eight institutions from the United States and Europe contributed patient biopsies to two central sites that conducted the sequencing analysis.  One of the surprising findings in this study was that approximately 90 percent of cases harbored some kind of genetic anomaly that was clinically actionable, meaning we have potential treatments to target that specific aberration. This suggests that clinical genomic sequencing could impact treatment decisions in a significant number of patients with disease,  says co-senior author and principal investigator Arul Chinnaiyan, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology and S.P. Hicks Professor of Pathology at the University of Michigan Health System. Previous studies have looked at the genomic landscape of clinically localized prostate cancer and found few actionable genomic alterations. This is the first study to focus on this specific subtype clinically, which is difficult to treat because patients nearly always develop resistance to currently available treatments.  Up to now, precision cancer medicine activities in advanced prostate cancer have been limited by lack of ability to acquire clinical samples from patients at the time of failure of hormone treatment and a lack of comprehensive genomic data for potentially actionable alterations,  explains Charles L. Sawyers, M.D., co-senior author and chair of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.   This multi-institutional and international study demonstrates the feasibility of comprehensive and integrative genomics on prospective biopsies from individual patients to enable precision cancer medicine activities in this large patient population. This study sets the stage for additional profiling efforts which may enable biological discovery and have immediate therapeutic relevance,  Sawyers adds. The researchers found that nearly all the tumors had a genetic aberration known to drive cancers. The most common, found in nearly two-thirds of the patients, were aberrations in the androgen receptor. This was expected to some extent since the hallmark of castration-resistant disease is that it no longer responds to conventional androgen-blocking therapies. But many other aberrations were found as well. Fourteen percent of patients had a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, which are already known to increase risk of breast and ovarian cancer. A class of drugs called PARP inhibitors have already been approved in BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, suggesting potential for PARP inhibitors to play a role in prostate cancers with this type of aberration. In addition, the researchers found that 8 percent of patients had an inherited genetic alteration. This suggests that genetic counseling may be appropriate for patients with prostate cancer. One of the unique aspects of this study is that it used fresh biopsy samples from living patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Typically it has been difficult to obtain a large enough quantity of quality tumor tissue, especially from bone biopsies, to make sequencing possible.  As part of their Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer Foundation grant, the researchers will sequence and follow a total of at least 500 patients. They expect the process to take several more years. As they begin to see more patients with androgen receptor mutations and other aberrations, the researchers hope to begin linking specific aberrations to response or resistance to specific treatments, making precision medicine more relevant and successful for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

Commenting on the award yesterday, Professor Miraldo, said:  We are delighted to receive this research grant from the Health Foundation. Our research aims to come up with cost effective solutions to real-life issues that affect people s lives. We chose to focus on cancer because of its high incidence, associated costs to taxpayers and because it is an area in which rapid innovation is taking place, although the UK still lags behind Europe in survival rates.  Her colleague Professor Propper added:  We chose to focus on senior healthcare professionals who, given their extensive knowledge and experience, play a key role in determining treatment but also have strong social networks to draw on for peer support. We also looked at how factors such as competition and collaboration between hospitals impact on decision-making and productivity.  Imperial s project is supported by the Health Foundation s Efficiency Research Programme that explores some of the most powerful ways that health, or health and social care services can address the challenge of increasing value and providing more for less.

The discovery, reported in the journal Nature Genetics, could have implications for the development of new methods of pain relief. Pain perception is an evolutionarily-conserved warning mechanism that alerts us to dangers in the environment and to potential tissue damage. However, rare individuals -- around one in a million people in the UK -- are born unable to feel pain. These people accumulate numerous self-inflicted injuries, often leading to reduced lifespan. Using detailed genome mapping, two teams of researchers collaborated to analyse the genetic make-up of 11 families across Europe and Asia affected by an inherited condition known as congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). This enabled them to pinpoint the cause of the condition to variants of the gene PRDM12. Family members affected by CIP carried two copies of the variant; however, if they had only inherited one copy from their parents, they were unaffected. The team looked at nerve biopsies taken from the patients to see what had gone wrong and found that particular pain-sensing neurons were absent. From these clinical features of the disease, the team predicted that there would be a block to the production of pain-sensing neurons during the development of the embryo -- they confirmed this using a combination of studies in mouse and frog models, and in human induced pluripotent stem cells (skin cells that had been reset to their 'master state', which enables them to develop into almost any type of cell in the body). PRDM12 had previously been implicated in the modification of chromatin, a small molecule that attaches to our DNA and acts like a switch to turn genes on and off (an effect known as epigenetics). The researchers showed that all the genetic variants of PRDM12 in the CIP patients blocked the gene's function. As chromatin is particularly important during formation of particular specialised cell types such as neurons, this provides a possible explanation for why pain-sensing neurons do not form properly in the CIP patients. ""The ability to sense pain is essential to our self-preservation, yet we understand far more about excessive pain than we do about lack of pain perception,"" says Professor Geoff Woods from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research at the University of Cambridge, who co-led the study. ""Both are equally important to the development of new pain treatments -- if we know the mechanisms that underlie pain sensation, we can then potentially control and reduce unnecessary pain."" PRDM12 is only the fifth gene related to lack of pain perception to have been identified to date. However, two of the previously-discovered genes have already led to the development of new pain killers that are currently been tested in clinical trials. ""We are very hopeful that this new gene could be an excellent candidate for drug development, particularly given recent successes with drugs targeting chromatin regulators in human disease,"" adds Dr Ya-Chun Chen from the University of Cambridge, the study's first author. ""This could potentially benefit those who are at danger from lack of pain perception and help in the development of new treatments for pain relief.""

New research suggests that the apparent simplicity of tactile sensation comes from a clever two-stage brain circuit. By manipulating this circuit with light-driven optical genetic tools, researchers made laboratory mice literally  lose touch  with their surroundings as their feet became unable to sense rough or smooth surfaces.  The study published in Neuron by a team at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan, shows that the perception of touch relies on two signals, one from the skin to the brain and another within the brain itself. This second signal relays the first signal from a lower-level brain area to a higher one and then boomerangs it back to the lower level. The higher brain area is required for touch perception and its inactivation renders mice unable to use sensations in their footpads to discriminate different floor textures. The research team led by Dr. Masanori Murayama observed the brains of mice after touching their paws and saw immediate activity in the sensory cortex the brain area that receives signals from the skin. Unexpectedly, they recorded a second slower source of activity tens of milliseconds after the first. Murayama explains,  we investigated the source of this second activation and found that high level motor cortex receives information from the sensory cortex and sends it back to the sensory cortex. This means that, for tactile perception, the flow of information from the skin to brain requires communication not only from the periphery to the brain but also reverberation between two brain areas.  While it was previously thought that one signal from the skin to the brain was sufficient to produce touch sensation, this study reveals that without the second signal, mice cannot feel or use the incoming sensory information, suggesting that they may not even perceive differences in texture. To investigate this idea, the researchers trained mice to distinguish two different floor textures, rough or smooth, by associating one of them with a food reward. When they prevented the second signal by shutting off the responsible neurons with light-activated optical genetic technology, the mice could not distinguish differences in floor texture.  Our results show that a reverberant neural circuit from sensory cortex to higher motor cortex is required for the perception of touch , said lead researcher Satoshi Manita. Murayama speculates that this two-stage circuit design may be a safety mechanism to ensure continuous accurate perception even when distracted by other senses, such as when feeling a steering wheel while concentrating on the road.  This form of perception, an external signal and its internal rebound, may extend to other senses,  concludes Murayama,  and we may find that communication between brain areas refines perception for more accurate and integrated behavior.

Dr. Kim Orth, Professor of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Dr. Joshua Mendell, Professor of Molecular Biology, were named by the institute, a philanthropic organization that promotes biomedical research. Their appointments bring to 13 the number of UT Southwestern faculty members who are HHMI investigators, out of a total of 17 in all Texas institutions.  Selection as an HHMI Investigator is based on the significance of the contributions a scientist has made to their field of research. Both of these talented scientists have made enormously important advances that will impact the future of medicine,  said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern.  Dr. Orth has made pioneering discoveries regarding the basic biochemical mechanisms underlying many bacterial infections, identifying new ways that invading bacteria hijack and deregulate a cell s signaling systems. Dr. Mendell has increased our fundamental understanding of the regulation and function of microRNAs in physiological processes, which is important for understanding wound healing, tissue regeneration, and diseases such as cancer,  added Dr. Podolsky, who holds the Philip O'Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science. Dr. Eric Olson, Chairman of Molecular Biology and Director of the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, said the department was gratified that two of its faculty members are joining such a prestigious group of scientists.  The appointment of Kim Orth and Josh Mendell to the HHMI is a thrill for all of us in the Department of Molecular Biology,  said Dr. Olson, who holds the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Science, the Pogue Distinguished Chair in Research on Cardiac Birth Defects, and the Annie and Willie Nelson Professorship in Stem Cell Research.  Not only are Kim and Josh gifted scientists, they are also catalytic colleagues who enrich our department and the institution with their discoveries, energy, and collegiality. I anticipate even greater achievements from them in the future.  Dr. Kim OrthDr. Orth holds the Earl A. Forsythe Chair in Biomedical Science and is a W.W. Caruth, Jr. Scholar in Biomedical Research.  I am so proud and happy for my lab, the Department of Molecular Biology, and UT Southwestern Medical Center to be selected as an HHMI Investigator,  Dr. Orth said.  I thank past and current members of my lab and my many collaborators for their rigorous and relentless efforts to discover the mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens during infection. Having HHMI support will allow my lab to identify new signaling paradigms used by both bacterial pathogens and mammalian cells. I am grateful for the support, friendship, and collegiality that I have received at UT Southwestern. It is an incredible place to do science.  The Orth lab studies how pathogens manipulate host cells for their own benefit and survival. Her team s work has uncovered unexpected strategies that bacteria use to survive and spread. Her research group has helped discern normal signaling processes in host cells, including mechanisms that can be exploited to treat disease. The researchers have found that Yersinia, the bacteria that causes plague, silences an infected cell s attempts to summon immune cells by chemically modifying a key signaling protein so that it can no longer be switched on. Their studies of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a bacterium that causes food-borne illness, showed that the microbe injects a toxin into host cells that remodels the cell's membrane structure, causing it to engulf the bacteria. Once inside, bacteria grow and divide until the host cell ruptures. Studies of another Vibrio toxin by Dr. Orth and her colleagues revealed a previously unrecognized way in which cells chemically modify their proteins to alter their function. The bacteria use the modification, which Dr. Orth named AMPylation, to cause host cells to collapse and die. Her team also discovered a protein that many bacteria use to adhere to cells during the early stages of infection, and the team is testing whether they can interfere with that attachment to prevent or weaken infections in patients. Dr. Orth received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from UT Southwestern, and joined the UT Southwestern faculty in 2001 as a W.W. Caruth Jr. Scholar in Biomedical Research. In 2003, she was named a Beckman Young Investigator by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, and in 2006 she was named a Burroughs Wellcome Investigator in Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease. In 2010, she received the Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research from The Welch Foundation, and in 2011 she received the Edith and Peter O Donnell Award from The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas (TAMEST). In 2012, she received the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) Young Investigator Award. Dr. Joshua Mendell I am thrilled to be able to represent UT Southwestern in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,  said Dr. Mendell, who was previously named an HHMI Early Career Scientist.  This is an amazing opportunity to take our research in new directions to address the most important problems in noncoding RNA biology and expand our understanding of the roles of these pathways in human disease. I am extremely thankful to the members of my laboratory, past and present, whose outstanding work made this possible, and to my department chair Eric Olson and other colleagues at UT Southwestern whose support and collaboration have been instrumental.  Dr. Mendell, a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar in Cancer Research, has been a leader in the study of microRNAs involved in regulating gene activity, and how they influence development and disease. He showed that a well-known, cancer-promoting protein, MYC, directly stimulates production of a specific cluster of six microRNAs that contribute to MYC s ability to drive tumor formation. Work from the Mendell lab has revealed involvement of microRNAs in several other critical cancer pathways as well, and the lab recently demonstrated that certain microRNAs are important for wound healing. Dr. Mendell s team also has uncovered new mechanisms through which the abundance of microRNAs is controlled in normal tissues and in tumors. Ultimately, Dr. Mendell is interested in developing new therapies for human disease, and his work in animal models has provided persuasive evidence of the therapeutic potential of microRNAs. His team slowed the growth of liver tumors in mice by giving the animals a specific microRNA that was present at lower levels in cancer cells, compared to healthy liver cells. The treatment killed tumor cells but preserved healthy cells, suggesting such therapies might be tolerated and effective. Dr. Mendell received his Ph.D. and M.D. from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and joined the UT Southwestern faculty in 2011. He was previously recognized as a March of Dimes Basil O Connor Scholar; a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar; a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar; and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Early Career Scientist. He received the Allan C. Davis Medal (Outstanding Young Scientist in the State of Maryland) and the American Association for Cancer Research Outstanding Achievement in Cancer Research Award in 2010.","Published: May 23, 2015"

With EMA Orphan Drug Designation, Isarna is eligible for development fee reductions and incentives including 10-year market exclusivity for ISTH0036.  Orphan designation for ISTH0036 in the European Union (EU) is a substantial accomplishment and corporate milestone for Isarna,  said Dr. Philippe Calais, President and Chief Executive Officer of Isarna Therapeutics.  Currently, patients with advanced-stage glaucoma have limited long-term treatment options. The EMA s recognition of the potential of ISTH0036 to help protect glaucoma patients  vision in this stage of their disease with orphan drug status is a significant step forward for the ongoing development of this novel therapy.  Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy frequently associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular vascular changes and extracellular matrix remodeling, namely of the trabecular meshwork, that can lead to progressive visual field loss and, ultimately, blindness. TGF- 2 is substantially elevated in the eyes of glaucoma patients and has specifically been identified as having a critical role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. It affects (1) changes in the ocular outflow region (trabecular meshwork) that can lead to open-angle glaucoma, has a (2) direct pathophysiologic effect on the optic nerve head, and leads to (3) so-called  bleb closure  post glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) by driving the fibrosis/scarring process. GFS is often the last line of treatment for patients with advanced-stage glaucoma. Scarring post GFS leads to closure of the surgically opened drainage canal, resulting in GFS failure and re-rise of IOP. ISTH0036 is currently the sole compound in clinical development worldwide that directly targets TGF- 2, which is seen as a core driver of glaucoma pathophysiology and the scarring process post GFS. In addition to glaucoma, several other diseases in ophthalmology have been linked to the modulation of TGF- , including proliferative vitreoretinopathy, diabetic retinopathy and corneal diseases. In April 2015 Isarna initiated a Phase 1 trial with ISTH0036 in patients with advanced-stage glaucoma post GFS.","Published: May 23, 2015"

RP is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye that lead to progressive loss of sight due to cells in the retina becoming damaged and eventually dying. The granting of Fast Track status follows the Company s announcement on 5 May 2015 that it had received regulatory approval from the FDA to commence a Phase I/II clinical trial in the US with its stem cell therapy candidate for RP. Fast Track designation is an FDA programme intended to expedite the development and review of new drugs or biological products targeting unmet medical need where the diseases concerned are serious or life threatening. Developers of products with Fast Track designation benefit from more frequent interactions with the FDA during clinical development as well as the potential for priority review and an accelerated market approval process for the product if supported by appropriate clinical data. ReNeuron s cell therapy candidate for RP has already been granted Orphan Drug Designation in both Europe and the US by the European Commission and the FDA, respectively. Products with Orphan Drug Designation benefit from potential market exclusivity post-approval for up to 7 years in the US and up to 10 years in Europe. The Phase I/II clinical trial with ReNeuron s cell therapy candidate for RP will be conducted at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, a world-renowned clinical centre for the treatment of retinal diseases. The trial design is an open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the hRPC stem cell therapy candidate in up to 15 patients with advanced RP. Preparations for the study have commenced and ReNeuron expects the study to begin in the second half of this year. Olav Helleb , Chief Executive Officer of ReNeuron, commented:  The granting of Fast Track designation from the FDA for our hRPC stem cell therapy candidate for RP is a very significant positive development for the Company. In considering the pre-clinical data we have presented to them and granting the designation, the FDA has recognized the potential of this treatment candidate to address RP as a serious unmet medical need. This, together with the Orphan Drug Designation already granted for the programme in both the US and Europe, provides accelerated clinical development and marketing authorization processes for our RP treatment candidate as well as the potential for a significant period of market exclusivity once approved in these major territories.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/it-runs-in-the-family-198853,It Runs in the Family Distantly related viruses share a common machinery for replication  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In an article published in Cell, researchers unveil the first detailed 3D-structure of the replication machinery - polymerase - of the La Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV), a virus which can cause human encephalitis. LACV is in the same broad group of viruses as influenza and the findings show that the LACV polymerase has striking similarities to influenza virus polymerase whose atomic structure was previously determined by the same team. Stephen Cusack and Juan Reguera from EMBL-Grenoble, who jointly led the research, now believe that all viruses within this group are likely to have a very similar polymerase. This opens up the possibility of quicker routes to developing treatments for the diseases they cause. Many dangerous human viruses, including influenza, Ebola and rabies viruses use RNA as their genetic material instead of DNA; these viruses have a special machine, known as the polymerase, to replicate their RNA genomes. The polymerase carries out two distinct functions: it makes copies of the virus  genetic material, or viral RNA (vRNA), destined to be packaged into progeny viruses; and it makes viral messenger RNA (mRNA), which are used to make viral proteins by hijacking the host cell protein making machinery. LACV and influenza viruses belong to the so-called segmented negative-strand RNA viruses, whose members cause diseases including Lassa fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, as well as all forms of influenza. This group of viruses has a very specific way of making their mRNA   they  snatch  a  cap  of genetic material from the host cell mRNA and insert it into their own. This sets them apart from other groups of viruses, but also means that the complex machinery required to do this is likely to be common to them all. Piotr Gerlach, who carried out this work for his PhD, explains:  These viruses have evolved separately over millions of years, so they are genetically quite different. Yet their polymerases maintain the same structural architecture and carry out replication and transcription of the genome in the same fashion.  For both processes, vRNA needs to pass through the polymerase so that it can be copied. Using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, the team were able to identify that both ends of the vRNA attach to the polymerase to create a circle, and then sections of vRNA thread themselves through the polymerase before rejoining the circle again. Depending on whether polymerase is in replication or transcription mode, the vRNA is used as a template to create copies of itself, or - with the addition of the  cap  snatched from the host cell - to create mRNA coding for viral proteins. The structure of the polymerase clearly shows that the exit and entry points for the template vRNA are close together, allowing it to easily pass through the polymerase and back out again. It also shows that the exit for whatever is produced - whether vRNA copies or mRNA - is on the opposite site of the polymerase, ensuring that no mistaken interactions between template and product occur. This level of detail has allowed the team to deduce how the polymerase functions in LACV and also give new insight into the influenza polymerase. Work is already underway to develop anti-viral drugs that inhibit the influenza virus polymerase. The team hope that by understanding structural and functional similarities across the whole group, promising compounds could be adapted to other related viruses.","Published: May 23, 2015"

Such vaccines, created by reprogramming a patient s own immune cells to fight invaders, hold great promise for treating cancer and other diseases. However, several inefficiencies have limited their translation to the clinic, and only one therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. While most of these vaccines are created with dendritic cells, a class of antigen-presenting cells with broad functionality in the immune system, the researchers demonstrate in a study published in Scientific Reports that B cells can be engineered to serve as an alternative.  We wanted to remove an important barrier in using B cells as an antigen-presenting cell population, helping them complement or replace dendritic cells,  says Gregory Szeto, a postdoc at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the paper s lead author. Darrell Irvine, a member of the Koch Institute and a professor of biological engineering and of materials sciences and engineering, is the paper s senior author. A new vaccine-preparation approachDendritic cells are the most naturally versatile antigen-presenting cells. In the body, they continuously sample antigens from potential invaders, which they process and present on their cell surface. The cells then migrate to the spleen or the lymph nodes, where they prime T cells to mount an attack against cells that are cancerous or infected, targeting the specific antigens that are ingested and presented. Despite their critical role in the immune system, dendritic cells have drawbacks when used for cell-based vaccines: They have a short lifespan, they do not divide when activated, and they are relatively sparse in the bloodstream. B cells are also antigen-presenting cells, but in contrast to dendritic cells, they can proliferate when activated and are abundant in the bloodstream. However, their functionality is more limited: Whereas dendritic cells constantly sample antigens they encounter, a B cell is genetically programmed only to bind to a specific antigen that matches the receptor on its surface. As such, a B cell generally will not ingest and display an antigen if it does not match its receptor. Using a microfluidic device, MIT researchers were able to overcome this genetically programmed barrier to antigen uptake - by squeezing the B cells. Through  CellSqueeze,  the device platform originally developed at MIT, the researchers pass a suspension of B cells and target antigen through tiny, parallel channels etched on a chip. A positive-pressure system moves the suspension through these channels, which gradually narrow, applying a gentle pressure to the B cells. This  squeeze  opens small, temporary holes in their membranes, allowing the target antigen to enter by diffusion. This process effectively loads the cells with antigens to prime a response of CD8 - or  killer  - T cells, which can then kill cancer cells or other target cells. The researchers studied the squeezed B cells in culture and found that they could expand antigen-specific T cells at least as well as existing methods using antibody-coated beads. As proof of concept, the researchers then transferred squeezed B cells and antigen-specific T cells into mice, observing that the squeezed B cells could expand T cells in the spleen and in lymph nodes. The researchers also say that this is the first method that decouples antigen delivery from B-cell activation. A B cell becomes activated when ingesting its antigen or when encountering a foreign stimulus that forces it to ingest nearby antigen. This activation causes B cells to carry out very specific functions, which has limited options for B-cell-based vaccine programming. Using CellSqueeze circumvents this problem, and by being able to separately configure delivery and activation, researchers have greater control over vaccine design. Gail Bishop, a professor of microbiology at the University of Iowa Carver School of Medicine and director of the school s Center for Immunology and Immune-Based Diseases, says that this paper presents a  creative new approach with considerable potential in the development of antigen-presenting cell vaccines.   The antigen-presenting capabilities of B cells have often been underestimated, but they are being increasingly appreciated for their practical advantages in therapies,  says Bishop, who was not involved in this research.  This new technical approach permits loading B cells effectively with virtually any antigen and has the additional benefit of targeting the antigens to the CD8 T-cell presentation pathway, thus facilitating the activation of the killer T cells desired in many clinical applications.  Main squeezeArmon Sharei, now a visiting scientist at the Koch Institute, developed CellSqueeze while he was a graduate student in the laboratories of Klavs Jensen, the Warren K. Lewis Professor of Chemical Engineering and a professor of materials science and engineering, and Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor and a member of the Koch Institute. Sharei, Jensen, and Langer are also authors of this paper. In a separate study published last month in the journal PLoS ONE, Sharei and his colleagues first demonstrated that CellSqueeze can deliver functional macromolecules into immune cells. The platform has benefits over existing delivery methods, including electroporation and genetically engineered viruses, which are limited to delivering nucleic acids. While nucleic acids can code a cell for a target antigen, these indirect methods have drawbacks: They have limited ability in coding for difficult-to-identify antigens, and using nucleic acids bears a risk for accidental genome editing. These methods are also toxic, and can cause cell damage and death. By delivering proteins directly into cells with minimal toxicity, CellSqueeze avoids these shortcomings and, in this new study, demonstrates promise as a versatile platform for creating more effective cell-based vaccines.  Our dream is to spawn out a whole class of therapies which involve taking out your own cells, telling them what to do, and putting them back into your body to fight your disease, whatever that may be,  Sharei says. After developing CellSqueeze at MIT, Sharei co-founded SQZ Biotech in 2013 to further develop and commercialize the platform. Just as the company has grown since then - now up to 13 employees - the device has also evolved. Sharei, now the company s CEO, says that by improving the design and increasing the number of channels, the current generation has a throughput of 1 million cells per second. Future stepsThe researchers say they now plan to refine their B-cell-based vaccine to optimize distribution and function of the immune cells in the body. A B-cell-based approach could also reduce the amount of patient blood required to prepare a vaccine. At present, patients receiving cell-based vaccines must have blood drawn over several hours each time a new dose must be prepared. Meanwhile, SQZ Biotech aims to reduce the footprint of its device, which could potentially lower the time and cost required to engineer cell-based vaccines.  We envision a future system, if we can take advantage of its microfluidic nature, as a bedside or field-deployable device,  Sharei says.  Instead of shipping your cells off to this big, centralized facility, you could do it in your hospital or your doctor s office.  As the biology and technology become further refined, the authors say that their approach could potentially be a more efficient, more effective, and less expensive method for developing cell-based therapies for patients.  Down the road, you could potentially get enough cells from just a normal syringe-based blood draw, run it through a bedside device that has the antigen you want to vaccinate against, and then you d have the vaccine,  Szeto says.","Published: May 23, 2015"

In order to understand the actual roles of particular genes in disease, however, it is not only critical to identify genes, but also to know in which cells the genes are expressed and when.  Genetics has gotten very good at finding genetic variation associated with disease. Going from genetic results to biological understanding of disease is the next important challenge,  said Broad Institute member Steve McCarroll, also director of genetics in the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad and an assistant professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. Critical to these biological insights is the ability to analyze individual cells  roles in health and disease. New advances in single-cell technology and computational analysis by researchers at the Broad are enabling studies with a scale, ease, and affordability not possible before, opening the door for applications increasingly closer to the clinic. The technology to sequence and analyze the genes expressed in a single cell - its transcriptome - has accelerated dramatically in just a few years. In 2012, Broad core institute member Aviv Regev and colleagues published a landmark analysis consisting of data from 18 cells. Last year, they expanded this to analyze hundreds of cells at once. Despite this growth, access to single-cell analysis was limited by the cost and time involved in preparing hundreds of individual cells for sequencing. McCarroll, Regev, and colleagues sought to change that.  We wanted to be able to chart the many cell types that are in the human body, human disease, and the many states and conditions that they may assume,  said Regev.  That would mean assaying many millions of cells, requiring a radical change from the available technologies where every cell had to be physically isolated from each other on a plastic plate or device.  In an effort to do just that, Stanley Center research fellow Evan Macosko, from McCarroll s lab, and Klarman Cell Observatory postdoctoral fellow Anindita Basu, from Regev s lab and that of associate member David Weitz, worked together and with other Broad colleagues, including computational biologist James Nemesh, and MIT assistant professor and Broad associate member Alex Shalek, to develop an approach they call Drop-Seq, with generous funding from the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, the Klarman Cell Observatory, the Simons Center for the Social Brain, and, most recently, the BRAIN initiative. Featured in Cell, Drop-Seq takes thousands of single cells isolated from tissues and mixes each one with a tiny, DNA-barcoded microbead in a nanoliter-sized droplet. Once in the droplet, the cell is broken apart and its messenger RNA (mRNA) is captured on the microbead. The mRNA/microbead complex is called a STAMP, for Single-cell Transcriptomes Attached to MicroParticles. The mRNA is then retrieved and converted into DNA, which is amplified and sequenced. Thousands of STAMPs (corresponding to thousands of cells) can be sequenced in a single reaction. The STAMP barcode can then be used to determine from which cell each transcript came. Tracking each cell in this new technique is critical.  We are replacing wells on a microtiter plate with drops,  said Weitz, who has worked for years to develop single-cell droplets with his group at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  The problem is that the wells on a microtiter plate have spatial information. We lose that by going to drops and we have to somehow get that information back.  Barcoding the microbeads allows cells to be tracked while running at great scale using very small reaction volumes. Single-cell analysis is a powerful experimental approach, in part because information from rare cell types is not lost among the masses. Unlike approaches that analyze DNA from a population of cells at once, single-cell analysis captures the heterogeneity of cells in a tissue. Testing this ability with Drop-Seq, the researchers analyzed more than 45,000 cells from the mouse retina, a well-studied model system with a large number of cell types. From their data, the researchers were able to identify 39 retinal cell types, including known types to show that the method works and several potential new ones. Before Drop-Seq, such an achievement would have taken decades. The high throughput capability of Drop-Seq helped researchers identify the new cell types.  When you are analyzing a single cell it s kind of like a snowflake,  said Macosko.  It s going to be different from every other cell in your system, but even though all snowflakes are different, there are certain things that all snowflakes have in common. The only way you would be able to know that is if you saw thousands and thousands of snowflakes.  In addition to its high throughput capabilities, Drop-Seq addresses two additional single cell analysis challenges - high cost and risk of contamination. Drop-Seq reduces the cost of single-cell analysis to about six cents per cell - a 500-fold decrease from previous methods. While mechanically or physically separating cells into individual wells of a microtiter plate in other single cell approaches is expensive, Drop-Seq s nanoliter scale droplets are so tiny that 100 million of them fit in a test tube the size of a person s thumb. Since individual cells are tracked with microbead barcodes, the whole sample can be pooled, shrinking the sequencing reaction volume and reducing costs significantly. Basu also noted that,  we don t have to worry about contamination as much since everything happens inside drops. The intact cell goes into a drop, it gets lysed, barcoded, and only then do you open the drop. At that point, contamination does not really affect it.  Drop-Seq, and other methods for single cell analysis, usually begins with a dissociated tissue, but inside the body a cell s location matters a great deal. New approaches in computational analysis are now tackling this challenge as well. A team including Rahul Satija, from Regev s lab, now at New York Genome Center, and Jeff Farrell, from associate member Alex Schier s group at Harvard University, developed a computational method known as Seurat to analyze gene expression patterns across complex tissues and derive cellular localization. Named after the French impressionist whose pointillist style is evocative of detailed spatial patterning information, Seurat uses machine learning approaches to map single cells by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data with RNA in situ hybridization patterns from tissues. The team used Seurat to generate a map of spatial patterning in zebrafish embryos based on the transcriptome of over 800 cells. In Nature Biotechnology, they describe their work in the fish, but the approach is applicable to other systems including human tissue samples. For canonical tissues, Seurat may be unbounded in terms of scalability and, Regev said  Drop-Seq is its best friend,  as parts of the Seurat package and work by Rahul Satija were integral for the analysis of cells and classification of the retina data obtained using Drop-Seq.  Seurat provides a framework in which to tackle the scale and type of data that experimental biologists pose when they use single cell genomics,  Regev said. With recent advances, single-cell analysis has become ripe for translational studies. Institute member Levi Garraway and his lab members at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, in collaboration with a team from the Klarman Cell Observatory, including postdoctoral fellow Itay Tirosh, Shalek, and the Observatory s Associate Director, Orit Rozenblatt-Rosen, has established a workflow to study several different types of cancers. Early results indicate that it may reveal important information about tumor heterogeneity and the factors controlling whether tumors respond to different types of therapies. Since single-cell analysis can identify alterations in gene activity within a tumor that eludes bulk analysis, if differences are found, the data can provide clues about the molecular pathways involved in tumor response. Also, monitoring expression changes over time in response to a therapy could help predict when cells will fail to respond.  We think that single-cell analysis may help us discern heterogeneity-not simply for its own sake, but for what it tells us about tumor subpopulations, how well they respond to therapy, and how tumor cells evolve to drug resistance.  said Garraway. Another area in which single-cell analysis can have a tremendous impact is microbial genomics.  Being able to discover and understand microbial diversity is continuing to grow in importance,  said Broad core institute member Paul Blainey, particularly as we learn more about the impact of the microbiome - the billions of microorganisms that live in and on the human body - on our health. Additionally, in response to the significant global threat posed by antibiotic resistance, researchers have stepped up efforts leveraging single cell analysis to find new antibiotics and identify antibiotic resistance genes. With these advances, single-cell analyses at the Broad have expanded to the scale of tens of thousands of cells - up from 18 just three years ago. As Eric Lander, president and director of the Broad Institute noted, this new era of  quantitative biomedicine  will allow us to learn from two types of populations - populations of people and populations of cells.  We need to learn from the natural variation among cells,  he said.  It s time to start thinking about a complete cell catalog.  Such a  cell atlas  will afford an unbiased way of identifying every cell type in the human body based on things like cell state, environment, lineage, and history.  A human cell atlas is now within reach,  Regev said.  It will require some discipline, methods, and computational approaches that will be scalable, sensitive, and robust. Most significantly it will require a partnership across biology, technology, and medicine.  Such a partnership would be a culmination of the interdisciplinary advances that have so successfully launched single cell genomics forward. It will cut across experimental, computational, and mathematical approaches and it has the potential to transform our understanding and treatment of human disease.","Published: May 23, 2015"

These solutions will combine the power of RainDance s proprietary digital droplet technology and single-molecule barcoding capabilities with Pacific Biosciences  proprietary long-range DNA amplification technology to provide sample preparation upstream of PacBio s long-read sequencing system. This combination could provide a method to generate millions of long, single-molecule barcoded DNA fragments, averaging 10-30 kilobases that originated from much longer (~ 100 kilobase) fragments. Combining this fragmentation and labeling scheme with a sequence context-unbiased amplification method for long DNA fragments, PacBio sequencing could provide de novo, haplotype-phased assembly of complex genomes. This would be possible even in genomic regions containing complex repeats or PCR-challenged sequences that limit performance of synthetic long-read approaches based upon short-read sequencing technologies. Furthermore, this approach will be designed to work with low DNA input - as little as 1 ng - to address scarce or difficult-to-procure samples.  Today, the research community is limited to technologies that  shred  genomes into tiny fragments before sequencing, using computational power to assemble a genome scaffold,  said Dr. W. Richard McCombie, Professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  This is inefficient and error-prone. The addition of longer range sequencing information would provide even better assemblies with precise location in context. Moreover, by barcoding long fragments prepared from individual molecules, we could also get haplotype phasing information across much longer stretches of the genome assemblies.  Dr. Michael Hunkapiller, President and CEO of Pacific Biosciences, commented:  The strength of RainDance s proprietary technology, patent position and commercialization experience in droplets was fundamental to our decision to enter into this collaboration. We chose to work with RainDance because they are the market leader in droplet-based target enrichment and are rapidly expanding into innovative sequencing applications for long reads and single cells. While our customers can already get industry-leading de novo genome assemblies with just PacBio, the addition of even longer-range sequencing information would provide even better assemblies.  Roopom Banerjee, RainDance Technologies  President and CEO, added:  This collaboration underscores the power of our proprietary droplet technology to help enable even higher quality de novo genome assembly to enhance our understanding and interpretation of the genetic basis of disease. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to continuously pushing the innovation frontier in droplet technology and sequencing applications. ","Published: May 23, 2015"

The new reference material, NIST RM 8398, is a  measuring stick  for the human genome, the coded blueprints of a person s genetic traits. It provides a well-characterized standard that can tell a laboratory how well its processes for determining the patterns in a person s DNA (called DNA or gene sequencing) are working by measuring the performance of the equipment, chemistry and data analysis involved. NIST RM 8398 was created by NIST and its partners in the Genome in a Bottle consortium, a group that includes stakeholders from industry, academia and the federal government. Scientists from NIST and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) helped organize the collaborative effort to provide the technical benchmarks (reference standards, reference methods and reference data) needed to enable widespread clinical applications of whole genome sequencing and science-based regulatory oversight of the technology by the FDA. In fact, the prototype version of NIST RM 8398 has already been on the job. In November 2013, the FDA used the genome created during the reference material s development phase to certify and approve one of the first commercially available high-throughput DNA sequencers. The new reference material marks a significant step forward in addressing FDA s regulatory needs for evaluating next-generation gene sequencing and genetic testing as outlined in President Barack Obama s Precision Medicine (also known as  personalized medicine ) initiative. DNA sequencers take long strings of a person s DNA and randomly chop them into small pieces that can be individually analyzed to determine their sequence of letters from the genetic code (A, C, G and T representing the four key components of DNA that code for protein production in living organisms: adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine). The sequenced pieces can then be compared to a defined ""reference sequence"" to identify differences in the two codes. The differences reveal where mutations have occurred in specific genes. However, biases and ""blind spots"" for certain sequences contribute to uncertainties or errors in the sequence analysis. These biases can lead to hundreds of thousands of disagreements between different sequencing results for the same human genome. Laboratories can now use the DNA in NIST RM 8398 (taken from a cell line-referred to as NA12878-of an individual whose genome was acquired in a 1980s research study) to identify these biases. Using the new NIST standard as a benchmark, DNA sequencing laboratories can be more confident in their reporting of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives. The reference material is the first complete human genome to have been extensively sequenced and re-sequenced by multiple techniques, with the results weighted and analyzed to eliminate as much variation and error as possible. The method used to create NIST RM 8398, as well as the findings validating the tool, may be found in a March 2014 Nature Biotechnology paper* as well as on the Genome in a Bottle website. In addition, the Genome Comparison and Analytic Testing, or GCAT, website enables real-time benchmarking of any DNA sequencing method using these results. The Genome in a Bottle consortium is currently developing well-characterized whole genome reference materials from two genetically diverse groups: Asians and Ashkenazi Jews. Both of the future reference materials will include sequenced genes from father-mother-child ""trios"" to utilize genetic links between family members. NIST RM 8398, Human DNA for Whole-Genome Variant Assessment (Daughter of Utah/European Ancestry), is available in vials each containing 10 micrograms of genomic NA12878 DNA. All samples of the reference material have been characterized for homogeneity (ensuring that each vial contains similar DNA) and stability (ensuring that the DNA ordered now will be comparable to samples ordered in the future).","Published: May 23, 2015"

The neural highway: Targeted routing of information All neurons in the brain belong to complex neural circuits, typically receiving and transmitting activity from and to multiple brain areas. A critical question in systems neuroscience is whether a brain region broadcasts the same information to multiple downstream areas, or if activity to distinct brain areas somehow conveys different information. Understanding this question is a key step forward in understanding the circuitry underlying cognition.   Discovery of a treatment to block the progression of multiple sclerosis A drug that could halt the progression of multiple sclerosis may soon be developed thanks to a discovery by a team at the CHUM Research Centre and the University of Montreal. The researchers have identified a molecule called MCAM, and they have shown that blocking this molecule could delay the onset of the disease and significantly slow its progression.   New Alzheimer s drug to enter clinical trials A new drug developed at Lancaster University in the UK that may help to prevent the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is to enter clinical trials. The number of people with dementia is steadily increasing. Currently there are about 850,000 cases in the UK, with numbers expected to reach over a million by 2021. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. It begins when a protein called beta-amyloid forms senile plaques that start to clump together in the brain, damaging nerve cells and leading to memory loss and confusion.   Brain area that integrates speech s rhythms found Duke and MIT scientists have discovered an area of the brain that is sensitive to the timing of speech, a crucial element of spoken language. Timing matters to the structure of human speech. For example, phonemes are the shortest, most basic unit of speech and last an average of 30 to 60 milliseconds. By comparison, syllables take longer: 200 to 300 milliseconds. Most whole words are longer still. In order to understand speech, the brain needs to somehow integrate this rapidly evolving information.   Nature vs. nurture: research shows it s both One of the great tussles of science   whether our health is governed by nature or nurture   has been settled, and it is effectively a draw. University of Queensland researcher Dr Beben Benyamin from the Queensland Brain Institute collaborated with researchers at VU University of Amsterdam to review almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years, involving more than 14.5 million twin pairs. The findings, published in Nature Genetics, reveal on average the variation for human traits and diseases is 49%, and 51% due to environmental factors and/or measurement errors.","Published: May 22, 2015"

Detailed standardized guidelines that are needed before a blood test could be used in practice have been published in Alzheimer's & Dementia. The guidelines establish protocols and reflect the continued efforts of an international working group that includes University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC). ""If we are ever going to get a blood test for Alzheimer's disease into the hands of primary care providers, we must have guidelines,"" said Sid O'Bryant, PhD, Interim Director of the Institute of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research. The highly rigid guidelines will be used in research for blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and will ensure every lab is following the same procedures when collecting blood, said Dr. O'Bryant, a member of the group and lead author of the paper. ""You can create a blood test in the lab, but if you don't have a systemized way for collecting the blood, the test will never go into practice,"" he said. ""You'll have one lab doing it one way and another lab doing something different."" Dr. O'Bryant has worked for several years with representatives from across the United States, Australia, Germany, England and other countries to create the standards. Everything from the type of needle used to draw blood to the length of the storage time is specified in the guidelines. Just as with blood tests for other diseases, such as diabetes, protocols must be established to make sure every lab performs the test exactly the same. Such guidelines are needed before Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval can be sought to use the test in a clinical setting.

Auriel Willette, a researcher in food science and human nutrition, found evidence that an elevated presence of a protein called neuronal pentraxin-2 may slow cognitive decline and reduce brain atrophy in people with Alzheimer's disease. Willette will present his findings at the Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society's annual scientific meeting, June 3 to 6 in Seattle, WA, USA. The Alzheimer's Association predicts that by 2050, nearly 14 million Americans over 65 will have Alzheimer's. Caring for them will cost an estimated $1 trillion every year. ""It's just a devastating illness,"" Willette said. ""Unlike a lot of other neurological diseases, Alzheimer's disease basically robs you of yourself."" Researchers have long suspected that inflammation in the brain leads to the cell death and brain atrophy found in people with Alzheimer's disease. Yet previous studies didn't place much emphasis on the varying roles of different immune proteins and how they might change the brain over time. As part of his latest research, Willette analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, an effort to collect and archive brain images and spinal fluid samples for researchers. He compared brain scans, as well as fluid from the brain and spine, from three groups: people without Alzheimer's disease, people with mild cognitive impairment or memory problems who may have Alzheimer's disease, and people with full-blown Alzheimer's disease. Willette found that participants with higher levels of neuronal pentraxin-2, the protein that regulates immune function and connections between neurons, showed little or no memory loss after two years. He also found that participants with higher levels of inflammatory proteins in their cerebrospinal fluid showed modestly greater memory loss and brain atrophy over two years. Neuronal pentraxin-2 is naturally produced in the body, primarily by neurons -- nerve cells that carry electrical impulses and chemical signals. The protein seems to be involved in forming or reconfiguring connections between neurons, possibly by clearing away old debris or inefficient connections to make way for new connections. Willette compared neuronal pentraxin-2 to a chemical bulldozer, clearing away old buildings to make way for new buildings. ""If you have high levels of this synapse-building, inflammation-regulating protein, you may not have as much, if any, change in your memory,"" he said. Reducing or eliminating risk factors for brain inflammation may help prevent Alzheimer's disease, Willette said. People who are overweight or obese are particularly at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease because excess body weight leads to inflammation in the brain. Exercise can help induce more activity between neurons, which could in turn boost a person's level of neuronal pentraxin-2. ""If part of this is related to obesity, moderate exercise and reducing body weight can reduce chronic inflammation in the brain,"" he said. ""Exercise definitely does increase your protective factors."" Complex jobs, hobbies, and social interactions might promote the production of protective proteins like neuronal pentraxin-2. Engaging in new or complicated cognitive tasks tends to form new or more complex connections between neurons, Willette said. ""Attaining higher levels of education, having a mentally demanding job, or regular and sustained mental effort builds something called cognitive reserve,"" Willette said. ""Cognitive reserve is thought to be a protective factor against memory loss and Alzheimer's disease. Neuronal pentraxin-2 may play a role in building cognitive reserve, helping to help create and remodel connections between neurons to handle the increased complexity thrown at the brain."" Willette cautions against the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or pain relievers, to reduce inflammation. Researchers don't know if these medications can help prevent the kind of inflammation associated with memory loss, and taking too many pain relievers can cause organ damage and even death. ""The literature is mixed,"" he said. ""Some studies find a protective effect, some do not. For people with memory loss, taking pills is also an issue. They may forget to take their pills or take too many."" Willette hopes that future studies will look at how Alzheimer's disease relates to body weight and epigenetics -- variations in gene activity that are not caused by changes in DNA. Even if researchers are unable to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, slowing its symptoms could be a major help to caregivers. ""If we can slow the symptoms or halt them temporarily for even three or four years, that could have a very meaningful impact on the ability to have people live their lives as opposed to having so much of it taken up with dealing day in and day out with this disease,"" Willette said.

The neurovascular unit is made up of blood vessels and smooth muscles under the control of autonomic neurons. Yet how the nervous and vascular systems come together during development to coordinate these functions is not well understood. Using human embryonic stem cells, researchers at University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center and Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute created a model that allows them to track cellular behavior during the earliest stages of human development in real-time. The model reveals, for the first time, how autonomic neurons and blood vessels come together to form the neurovascular unit. ""This new model allows us to follow the fate of distinct cell types during development, as they work cooperatively, in a way that we can't in intact embryos, individual cell lines or mouse models,"" said co-senior author of the study David Cheresh, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Pathology, vice-chair for research and development and associate director for translational research at UC San Diego. ""And if we're ever going to use stem cells to develop new organ systems, we need to know how different cell types come together to form complex and functional structures such as the neurovascular unit."" The neurovascular unit comprises three cells types: endothelial cells, which form the blood vessel (vascular) tube; smooth muscle cells, which cover the endothelial tube and control vascular tone; and autonomic neurons, which influence the smooth muscle's ability to contract and maintain vascular tone. The study revealed that separate signals produced by endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are required for embryonic cells to differentiate into autonomic neurons. The researchers discovered that endothelial cells secrete nitric oxide, while smooth muscle cells use the protein T-cadherin to interact with the neural crest, specialized embryonic cells that give rise to portions of the nervous system and other organs. The combination of endothelial cell nitric oxide and the T-cadherin interaction is sufficient to coax neural crest cells into becoming autonomic neurons, where they can then co-align with developing blood vessels. In addition to answering long-standing questions about human development and improving the odds that scientists will one day be able to generate artificial organs from stem cells, this new insight on the autonomic nervous system also has implications for rare inherited conditions such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis and Hirschsprung's disease. ""These observations may help to explain certain human disease syndromes in which abnormalities of the nervous system appear to be associated, for previously unclear reasons, with vascular abnormalities,"" said co-senior author Evan Snyder, MD, PhD, professor and director of the Center for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine at Sanford-Burnham.

The findings suggest such habits may make it difficult to lose weight later in life, and that dieting efforts should not only target the initial desire to eat tempting food, but the subsequent thinking about actually tasting and eating it - in other words, you should picture yourself munching a salad rather than a cheeseburger. The study, which appears in the journal Cerebral Cortex, included researchers from Dartmouth College's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. The prevalence of food advertising and adolescent obesity has increased dramatically over the past 30 years, and research has linked the number of television shows viewed during childhood with greater risk for obesity. In particular, considerable evidence suggests that exposure to food marketing promotes eating habits that contribute to obesity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the Dartmouth researchers examined brain responses to two dozen fast food commercials and non-food commercials in overweight and healthy-weight adolescents ages 12-16. The commercials were embedded within an age-appropriate show, ""The Big Bang Theory,"" so the participants were unaware of the study's purpose. The results show that in all the adolescents, the brain regions involved in attention and focus (occipital lobe, precuneus, superior temporal gyri and right insula) and in processing rewards (nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex) were more strongly active while viewing food commercials than non-food commercials. Also, adolescents with higher body fat showed greater reward-related activity than healthy weight teens in the orbitofrontal cortex and in regions associated with taste perception. The most surprising finding was that the food commercials also activated the overweight adolescents' brain region that controls their mouths. This region is part of the larger sensory system that is important for observational learning. ""This finding suggests the intriguing possibility that overweight adolescents mentally simulate eating while watching food commercials,"" says lead author Kristina Rapuano, a graduate student in Dartmouth's Brain Imaging Lab. ""These brain responses may demonstrate one factor whereby unhealthy eating behaviors become reinforced and turned into habits that potentially hamper a person's ability lose weight later in life."" Although previous studies have shown heightened brain reward responses to viewing appetizing food in general, the Dartmouth study is one of the first to extend this relationship to real world food cues -- for example, TV commercials for McDonald's and Burger King -- that adolescents encounter regularly. The brain's reward circuitry involves the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitter chemicals that give pleasure and may lead to addictive behavior. Children and adolescents see an average of 13 food commercials per day, so it isn't surprising they show a strong reward response to food commercials. But the new findings that these heightened reward responses are coupled with bodily movements that indicate simulated eating offer a clue into a potential mechanism on how unhealthy eating habits are developed. ""Unhealthy eating is thought to involve both an initial desire to eat a tempting food, such as a piece of cake, and a motor plan to enact the behavior, or eating it,"" Rapuano says. ""Diet intervention strategies largely focus on minimizing or inhibiting the desire to eat the tempting food, with the logic being that if one does not desire, then one won't enact. Our findings suggest a second point of intervention may be the somatomotor simulation of eating behavior that follows from the desire to eat. Interventions that target this system, either to minimize the simulation of unhealthy eating or to promote the simulation of healthy eating, may ultimately prove to be more useful than trying to suppress the desire to eat.""

Their article shares exquisitely detailed anatomic color photographs, along with step-by-step descriptions of two alternative routes for neurosurgeons performing these demanding implant procedures. Auditory brainstem implants can restore varying degrees of hearing to patients with ""retrocochlear"" hearing loss. These patients have deafness caused by damage to the cochlear nerves -- sometimes called the acoustic or auditory nerves -- which transmit sound information from the inner ear to the brain. The cochlear nerve damage most commonly results from brain tumors associated with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Auditory brainstem implants are similar in principle to the more commonly placed cochlear implant, used in patients with damage to the cochlea -- part of the inner ear. Because of the need to place the implant and electrodes in the brainstem, rather than the inner ear, the surgery required for auditory brainstem implantation is much more complex. In a series of ten cadaver brainstem dissections, the researchers explored the anatomy of the region that the neurosurgeon must navigate to perform auditory brainstem implantation. They also mapped out the best neurosurgical approaches, both for surgery to remove the tumors and for auditory brainstem implant placement. Based on their findings, Dr. Rhoton and colleagues detail two surgical approaches: a ""translabyrinthine"" and a ""retrosigmoid"" approach. They outline a step-by-step route for both approaches, designed to provide safe access to the area while minimizing trauma to the brainstem and surrounding structures. The authors highlight the value of using endoscopes to help in visualizing and accessing the target area for implant placement. More than 1,000 auditory brainstem implant procedures have been performed worldwide so far. The procedure was previously approved only for patients with NF2 aged 12 years or older. Recently, clinical trials were approved for children with congenital malformations or other causes of retrocochlear deafness. Minimizing damage to the brainstem and associated blood vessels appears to be a critical factor in achieving good speech recognition after auditory brainstem implantation. The hearing results are also better in patients with a shorter duration of deafness. Dr. Rhoton and colleagues hope that their descriptions and illustrations will help to increase understanding of the anatomy and surgical approaches to auditory brainstem implantation, contributing useful hearing to adults and children with NF2 and other causes of retrocochlear deafness.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/modern-alchemy-201250,Modern Alchemy  Chemists have discovered a broad and strikingly inexpensive method for synthesizing  amines   a class of organic compounds prominent in drugs and other modern products  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The new reaction is particularly useful for synthesizing complex amines that would be highly valuable in pharmaceuticals, but are impractical or impossible to make with standard methods. Yet the reaction requires little more than the mixing of two abundant compounds, a nitroarene and an olefin, with an iron catalyst.  This is interesting science because a transformation like this has never been seen before,  said Phil S. Baran, the Darlene Shiley Chair in Chemistry at TSRI who led the new study.  Part of what s unique about this scientific advance is that it s also being immediately applied by industry it s just pretty darn useful. It s as if we re taking dirt, and then adding a bit of rust, and putting it all in a blender and ending up with gold except that the amines we can make with this new method are often worth much more than their weight in gold.  Amines are chemical cousins of the relatively simple molecule ammonia (NH3), although they are often much more complex. Some amines with particularly desirable properties such as a resistance to breakdown by enzymes in the body are hard to make using standard methods. As Baran and his team explored the scope of the new reaction by cataloguing how pairings of different nitroarenes and olefins yield different amines, they found the reaction worked smoothly under unusually mild conditions to generate a great variety of complex amine-containing compounds.  Some of the compounds we made contain sensitive functional groups that can t survive conventional amine synthesis reactions,  said Jinghan Gui, a research associate in the Baran laboratory who was first author of the paper. In addition to the unusually high tolerance for functional groups, the new amine synthesis utilizes humble main ingredients.  Nitroarenes and olefins are cheap feedstock chemicals that everybody already has on their lab shelf,  Baran said.  Yet when they are merged together in this unique way, they turn out to make compounds that would be extraordinarily difficult to make in any other way.  The team used the reaction to synthesize more than 100 different amines, including valuable drug compounds, in fewer steps than traditional methods could afford. Much of this work was conducted by chemists at Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has an ongoing research collaboration with TSRI, and at the New Jersey-based contract research organization Kemxtree.  This reaction is conceptually novel, yet simple and practical to carry out just in the past two months we ve used it for dozens of decagram-scale reactions in our lab,  said Kemxtree chemist Swaminathan R. Natarajan, who is constructing new libraries of unique amine compounds for drug discovery research. ""The inexpensive and mild nature of this reaction, along with its high functional group tolerance, make it potentially useful for our work,  said Bristol-Myers Squibb process chemist Michael A. Schmidt.  This transformation could greatly improve the synthetic efficiency of making complex molecules.""  While testing this new methodology, we were able to rapidly access targeted intermediate compounds for which other standard methods of preparation had failed,  said Bristol-Myers Squibb discovery chemist Bill Pitts.  This innovative method developed by the Baran laboratory provides our partners in academia and industry with a highly practical way of accessing typically unexplored chemical space,  said Christopher Thomas, global product manager at chemistry supplier Sigma-Aldrich, which partially funded the research under a collaborationn and commercialization agreement with TSRI.","Published: May 22, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/vitamin-e-keeps-muscles-healthy-213737,Vitamin E Keeps Muscles Healthy Body builders have it right  vitamin E does help build strong muscles  and scientists appear to have figured out one important way it does it  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Vitamin E has long known as a powerful antioxidant, and now scientists have shown that without it, the plasma membrane, which essentially keeps a cell from spilling its contents and controls what moves in and out, cannot properly heal. That's a big problem for many cells, such as muscle cells, which get membrane tears just from being used. ""Every cell in your body has a plasma membrane, and every membrane can be torn,"" said Dr. Paul L. McNeil, cell biologist at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents University. The scientist suspects knowing the cell membrane repair action of vitamin E has implications for muscular dystrophy, and common diabetes-related muscle weakness, as well as traumatic brain injury, resulting from collisions on a football field, battlefield, or roadway. With a traumatic brain injury, for example, one of the first events that happens is that the plasma membrane of the neurons, key cells in the central nervous system, tear. ""Part of how we build muscle is a more natural tearing and repair process -- that is the no pain, no gain portion -- but if that repair doesn't occur, what you get is muscle cell death. If that occurs over a long period of time, what you get is muscle-wasting disease,"" said McNeil. The association between vitamin E and healthy muscles is well-established; for example, mammals and birds deprived of the vitamin experience muscle-wasting disease, in some cases lethal disease. A poor diet resulting in low vitamin E levels in the elderly contributes to frailty syndrome, a condition where muscles are weak and people are unsteady on their feet. The ubiquitous vitamin's well-established role as a powerful antioxidant has led to its use in antiaging products and in helping delay the onset of Alzheimer's by protecting neurons from free radicals. Exactly how vitamin E protects muscle, as well as other cell types, has been unknown. ""This means, for the first time, 83 years after its initial discovery, we know what the cellular function of vitamin E is, and knowing that cellular function, we can now ask whether we can apply that knowledge to medically relevant areas,"" McNeil said. For the new study, rats were fed either normal rodent chow, chow where vitamin E had been removed, or vitamin E-deficient chow where the vitamin was supplemented. First, there was a period of training to ascertain the rats' innate ability to run downhill on a treadmill -- a challenging move for muscles, called an eccentric contraction. The exercise helps lengthen muscles and can produce the most soreness in athletes because of the high mechanical stress as the muscle contracts and lengthens simultaneously. Gravity is an additional force. They found vitamin E-deficient rats were generally deficient in their running ability compared with controls and made significantly more visits to a grid, despite the fact that they received a mild electric shock when they stood there. The scientists also administered a dye that could not permeate an intact plasma membrane and found it easily penetrated the muscle cells of vitamin E-deficient rats. McNeil notes that a healthy cell makes a patch within a minute and has completely restored the cell membrane within a few minutes. Later examination of the quadriceps muscle fibers under a microscope showed rats fed normal chow or chow where vitamin E had been restored were essentially the same. The large thigh muscle fibers in rats fed vitamin E-deficient chow were smaller and inflamed. While exactly how free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, interfere with important cell membrane repair remains a mostly unanswered question, McNeil suspects they basically get in the way. Free radicals are essentially waste products produced by normal body functions, such as using oxygen, as well as exposures to cigarette smoke and other air pollutants and chemicals. Because it's lipid-soluble, vitamin E can actually insert itself into the membrane to prevent free radicals from attacking. It also can help keep phospholipids, a major membrane component, compliant so they can better repair after a tear. For example, exercise causes the muscle cell powerhouse, the mitochondria, to burn a lot more oxygen than normal and so produce more free radicals while the physical force tears the membrane. Vitamin E enables adequate plasma membrane repair despite the oxidant challenge, helping keep the situation in check. McNeil's finding that vitamin E is essential to rapid cell membrane repair, and ultimately cell survival, likely holds up across different cell types because, in culture at least, when the scientists have treated a number of different cells types with vitamin E, they documented similar enhanced cell membrane repair. ""The major medical significance here is yet to be uncovered,"" McNeil said, but could one day mean not just supplements to aid sluggish membrane repair in diseases such as muscular dystrophy, but preventive therapy for high-risk individuals such as astronauts or soldiers. McNeil's 2011 study in Nature Communications indicated that, at least in cell culture, one way vitamin E keeps muscles healthy is by enabling cell membrane repair. Those studies linked the antioxidant and membrane repair benefits of vitamin E. Muscle cells in culture repaired better when vitamin E was added; when cells were exposed to free radicals, repair failed. Those findings led McNeil to see if the findings held up in research rats. Still earlier work showed that muscle cells were more fragile and membrane tears more common in muscular dystrophy. Good sources of vitamin E include vegetable oils; nuts; seeds such as sunflower seeds; green leafy vegetables; and fortified breakfast cereals, fruit juices, and margarine, according to the National Institutes of Health.","Published: May 22, 2015"

What we show, for the first time, are the proteins that hold chromatin together during mitosis, or cell replication, are the same proteins that play an important role in the DNA damage response in these viral infections,  said Laimonis Laimins, Ph.D., chair of Microbiology-Immunology. The study describes two cell proteins as critical regulators of viral replication; SMC1, a protein that bridges DNA together when cells divide, and CTCF, a protein that binds together strands of DNA to form loops that can either repress or enhance gene expression. When the scientists reduce the genetic expression of these proteins, they found HPV was unable to replicate. They also confirmed that CTCF and SMC1 binding was critical to genome amplification, through mutating CTCF sites on the HPV genome. Reduction in the expression of CTCF resulted in the loss of the ability for SMC1 to interact with the HPV genome.  This research is interesting because it show the ways in which the virus may interact with our own DNA,  said Kavi Mehta, first author of the paper and a third-year graduate student in the Walter S. and Lucienne Driskill Graduate Program in Life Sciences.  The importance of this research is understanding the life cycle of this virus. Now that we have a little bit of a greater understanding of how the virus maintains itself through the cell lifecycle, we might be able to find ways to prevent or understand how the virus evades the immune system.  Next, Mehta plans to investigate how HPV uses these proteins to bring in other factors that allow the virus to replicate.  These are small steps to figuring out this entire virus life cycle that is important for HPV biology,  Mehta said.  Once we know more about that, then this knowledge could be used as a base for developing therapeutics. ","Published: May 22, 2015"

Organovo previously partnered with Merck to print liver and kidney tissues. The company anticipates its kidney tissue will be ready for release in the second half of 2016. L Oreal has been producing skin samples from donated tissues since the 1980s to avoid animal testing, Bloomberg reported.  But the cosmetics giant, which currently grows more than 100,000 skin samples per year, according to Bloomberg, wants more derma and intends to automate and help speed up production over the next five years with Organovo s help.  Research for the project will take place in Organovo s labs and L Oreal s new California research center. L Oreal will provide skin expertise and all the initial funding, while Organovo, which is already working with such companies as Merck to print liver and kidney tissues, will provide the technology,  the Bloomberg report said. Both companies will retain rights to the tissue in different ways. L'Oreal uses about half of the skin samples it currently produces, available in nine varieties that span ages and ethnicities, while the other half is sold to pharmaceutical companies and others in the cosmetics industry, Bloomberg reported.  Some of the biggest potential advantages are the speed of production as well as the level of precision that 3D printing can achieve,  Give Balooch, global vice president of L Oreal s technology incubator said in an email to the Washington Post.  L Oreal s focus right now is not to increase the quantity of the skin we produce but instead to continue to build on the accuracy and consistent replication of the skin engineering process.  The Verge writes Organovo s manufacturing process entails detecting essentially the key building blocks of the specified tissue and concocting a specialized  bio-ink  to begin building the tissue in vertical layers. By comparison, L Oreal s scientists break down skin tissue into basic cells, sustain those cells on a special diet, and grow them in a setting that imitates the human body taking about a week to form.","Published: May 22, 2015"

Some industry pundits rightfully question the modest protective efficacies of CYD-TDV and RTS,S/AS01. Immunization must therefore be leveraged alongside vector control strategies, national and international surveillance programs, and public awareness campaigns as part of integrated disease prevention and control initiatives. Upon their anticipated approvals in late 2015, both Sanofi Pasteur s CYD-TDV and GSK s RTS,S/AS01 have the potential to begin providing long-awaited relief to billions of people living under the constant threat of dengue and malaria. At the very least, they represent landmark advances in the development of vaccines against these serious arthropod-borne illnesses. Nevertheless, GlobalData expects that while vaccines will be an essential component of future dengue and malaria prevention and control efforts, immunization cannot succeed as a  silver bullet  solution for either disease. Renewed vector control efforts, from established methods such as mosquito nets and insecticides, to emerging microbiological and genetic techniques, are especially important to curtailing dengue and malaria transmission. There are a number of novel tools on the horizon that will complement vaccines, most notably improved insecticides and innovative microbiological (Walbachia, Chromobacterium [Csp_P]) and genetic (sterile male) vector control technologies, as well as more potent antivirals for dengue and antiparisitics for malaria. The cost of these vaccines will also emerge as a key issue, as both dengue and malaria primarily affect the developing world.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/diversity-of-the-global-ocean-microbiome-192580,Diversity of the Global Ocean Microbiome The Tara Oceans Consortium have revealed the huge diversity of species living in the oceans including viruses  prokaryotes and picoeurokaryotes   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A nearly four-year expedition to sample metagenomes from plankton living in the world's waters has catalogued more than 35,000 marine denizens, more than 40 million genes belonging to them, and described interactions between the various organisms living in the topmost oceanic layer. The Tara Oceans consortium set out on a 110-foot research schooner in 2009 to sample plankton from 210 sites around the globe and presented the results from its November 2013 data freeze in five Science papers today. As the researchers reported, they generated more than 7 trillion basepairs from 243 samples enriched for viruses, prokaryotes, and picoeukaryotes. They found more than 5,000 viral populations and about 150,000 genetic types of eukaryotes, and described how these various components of the oceanic ecosystem come together. ""Plankton, in fact, is much more than just food for the whales,"" noted Chris Bowler, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and an author on the set of studies, during a press teleconference this week. ""Although tiny, these organisms are a vital part of the Earth's life support system providing half for the oxygen generated each year on Earth by photosynthesis and lying at the base of marine food chains on which all other ocean life depends."" As they sailed around the world   through the Mediterranean Sea to Indian Ocean and over to the Atlantic, Southern, and Pacific Oceans   consortium researchers collected plankton ranging in size from 0.02 micrometers to a few millimeters, along with physical and chemical data from the 210 sampling sites. The researchers focused on the sunlit upper layer of the ocean, down to about 200 meters, though they did collect some samples from the twilight zone. The data freeze covered by this suite of papers includes 579 samples collected at 75 different stations. By drawing on a subset of the Tara Oceans data, researchers led by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's Peer Bork generated a global Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog with more than 40 million representative genes from a wide swathe of viruses, prokaryotes, and picoeukaryotes. This catalog, Bork and his colleagues noted, includes more than four times the number of genes than the human gut microbial reference gene catalog contains. Most of the genes in the ocean catalog appear to be prokaryotic in origin and the eukaryotic genes that are present hail mainly from protists. Some 81 percent of the genes Bork and his colleagues identified were unique to the Tara Ocean samples, underscoring, they said, how much of ocean life remains to be studied. Gene novelty, they noted, increased as the ocean depth at which their samples were obtained increased, as did taxonomic and functional richness. Temperature also appeared to be a key environmental driver of community composition, as the researchers estimated it could account for some 86 percent of variance. ""That means that at the surface layer, for example, geographic distance has less impact on the community composition than temperature, and that has implications   given the rise of water temperature and climate, et cetera,"" Bork said. Surprisingly to the researchers, when they compared the core functions of the genes making up the ocean microbiome to those in the human gut microbiome   one of the few widely studied microbiomes   they found that the most of prokaryotic gene abundance in the ocean and in the human gut could be ascribed to a shared functional core. Viruses are one oft-overlooked source of biological diversity in the oceans, and the University of Arizona's Matthew Sullivan and his colleagues developed the Tara Oceans Viromes dataset based on 43 samples from 26 locations in the upper ocean. While this dataset is restricted to dsDNA viruses lurking in the waters, they uncovered more than 5,000 viral populations. Only 39 of those populations were similar to known viruses. ""This means that the most abundant and widespread viral populations in the oceans have yet to be characterized, but now we have an idea of what viruses are important targets for future investigations, "" Arizona's Jennifer Brum, first author of the ocean viral community paper, said. She and her colleagues also found that viral genetic diversity at any given location is high, but that the global diversity of ocean-dwelling viruses is about the same as what's seen in any individual sample. This suggested to the researchers that viruses that widely distributed throughout the global oceans   likely by major ocean currents   and then local environmental conditions influence community composition. Meanwhile, researchers led by Eric Karsenti at CNRS focused on the taxonomic and ecological diversity of medium-sized eukaryotes. They generated about 766 million raw rDNA reads from 334 plankton samples obtained at 47 sites at two water-column depths. Using a meta-barcode-based approach, they grouped those reads, once filtered, into about 110,000 operational taxonomic units. This, Karsenti and his colleagues found, was enough to approach saturation at both a local and global scale.  Based on this, they extrapolated that there are some 150,000 OTUs making up the ocean microbiome, vastly more than the 11,200 or so formally described marine eukaryotic species. In addition, about a third of these OTUs couldn t be assigned to any known eukaryotic group, and they found that a significant portion of the biodiversity they captured belongs to heterotrophic protists, especially parasites or symbiotic hosts, which, they said highlights the interconnections among ocean life. Indeed, environmental factors like temperature, phosphate, and nitrogen dioxide don't fully explain plankton community structure, according to KU Leuven's Jeroen Raes and colleagues. Based on 313 plankton samples collected at various depths at 68 stations across the global oceans as well as environmental data taken at those sites, Raes and colleagues constructed a global network of taxon-taxon and taxon-environment interactions. ""So essentially what we did in our [paper] was to derive the social network of the oceans, who is living with whom and how the environment shapes these connections,"" first author Gipsi Lima-Mendez from Leuven said. These interactions are marked by competition, collaboration, parasitism, and predation, she noted, and are just as important as environmental influences. For instance, based on their interactome data, she and her colleagues predicted a photosymbiotic interaction between an acoel flatworm and a green microalga, a prediction they were able to confirm using microscopy and other tools. Finally, consortium researchers showed that when plankton communities mix   such as in the Agulhas rings that form when Indian Ocean waters leak into the South Atlantic and that play an important role in climate regulation   there appears to be a broad similarity among the populations. However, they noted that there is a restructuring of the community at a finer scale, especially based on organism size, as they travel from the Indian to South Atlantic Ocean. Environmental selection at this chokepoint, Daniele Iudicone from Stazione Zoologica in Naples and his colleagues said, may thus block plankton dispersal.","Published: May 22, 2015"

Next, for each biopsy, they ran a targeted next-generation sequencing panel of 74 genes, including genes known to play a role in skin cancers, genes involved in a wide range of cancers, and genes whose function are unknown but are frequently mutated in skin samples that were taken from the COSMIC database. ""With this technology, we can now peer into the first steps a cell takes to become cancerous,"" Peter Campbell, a corresponding author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said in a statement. The researchers chose to look at eyelid skin because it has a high level of sun exposure. They used a panel targeting the coding regions of 74 cancer-associated genes and sequenced each of the 234 biopsies to 500x coverage on the Illumina HiSeq. For one sample they sequenced the whole genome to 147x coverage. In total, they found 3,760 mutations, corresponding to about 140 per square centimeter of skin. Between 18 percent and 32 percent of skin cells carried at least one mutation in the targeted genes. Interestingly, the mutational pattern ""closely matched that expected for ultraviolet light exposure and that seen in skin cancers,"" the authors wrote. For instance, there were high rates of cytosine to thymine mutations and high rates of CC to TT changes, ""consistent with the known chemistry of sunlight-induced damage to DNA."" Next, the researchers looked at clonality and positive selection, and found that six genes had an excess of protein-altering base substitutions than would be expected by chance, and five of those also had an excess of indels or di-nucleotide substitutions. The NOTCH1 gene was the most frequently mutated gene and NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 also had an excess of mutations. In total, NOTCH mutations were found in around 25 percent of cells. The NOTCH receptors are key regulators and frequently mutated in epithelial cancers and lymphoid malignancies. ""The density of positively selected driver mutations was surprisingly high"" in the NOTCH genes, the authors wrote, estimated to be about 83 clones per square centimeter. Aside from NOTCH mutations, there was also an excess of mutations to the tumor suppressor genes FAT1 and TP53, in about 3 percent to 5 percent of cells. For one sample that contained a massive clone with a known driver mutation in TP53 and an activating mutation in FGFR3 that spanned six adjacent biopsies, the researchers performed whole-genome sequencing. They identified nearly 74,000 base substitutions and 2,248 indels with a mutational signature corresponding to UV light exposure. Despite the similarities seen between the normal skin samples and cancerous samples, the authors caution that there are still huge differences, particularly in the frequency of driver mutations. For the four normal samples the researchers evaluated, there were approximately .27 driver mutations per cell. But genomic dat from actual skin cancer genomes has found about 2.7 driver mutations per cell. ""The burden of mutations observed is high but almost certainly none of these clones would have developed into skin cancer,"" I igo Martincorena, first author from the Sanger Institute, said in a statement. Campbell added that the study showed evidence that clonal selection for cancer-associated mutations ""give cells a boost"" that ""increases the pool of cells waiting for the next mutation to push them even further,"" but what is not known is how many of these events are needed before cells become fully cancerous.","Published: May 22, 2015"

The new method, dubbed ""magnetospinning,"" provides a simple, scalable, and safe means for producing large quantities of nanofibers that can be embedded with a multitude of materials, including live cells and drugs, according to the researchers. Thousands of times thinner than the average human hair, nanofibers are used by medical researchers to create advanced wound dressings and for tissue regeneration, drug testing, stem cell therapies, and the delivery of drugs directly to the site of infection. ""The process we have developed makes it possible for almost anyone to manufacture high-quality nanofibers without the need for expensive equipment,"" said Sergiy Minko, Ph.D., study co-author and the Georgia Power Professor of Polymers, Fibers and Textiles in UGA's college of family and consumer sciences. ""This not only reduces costs, but it also makes it possible for more businesses and researchers to experiment with nanofibers without worrying too much about their budget."" Currently, the most common nanofiber manufacturing technique, called electrospinning, uses high-voltage electricity and specially designed equipment to produce the polymer strings. Equipment operators must have extensive training to use the equipment safely. ""In contrast to other nanofiber spinning devices, most of the equipment used in our device is simple,"" said Dr. Minko. ""Essentially, all you need is a magnet, a syringe, and a small motor."" At laboratory scale, a v simple handcrafted setup is capable of producing spools containing hundreds of yards of nanofibers in a matter of seconds. Polymer that has been melted or liquefied in a solution is mixed with biocompatible iron oxide or another magnetic material and placed inside a hypodermic needle. This needle is then positioned near a magnet that is fixed atop a spinning circular platter. As the magnet passes by the tip of the needle, a droplet of the polymer fluid stretches out and attaches to the magnet, forming a nanofiber string that winds around the platter as it continues to spin. The device can spin at more than 1,000 revolutions per minute, enough time to create more than 50 kilometers (or about 31 miles) of ultra-thin nanofiber. It's a relatively simple process, but it produces a high-quality product, said Alexander Tokarev, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research in Dr. Minko s lab and co-author of the study (Magnetospinning of Nano- and Microfibers) which appears in Advanced Materials.  The product we can make is just as thin and just as strong as nanofibers created through other methods,"" he said. ""Plus, users don't have to worry about the safety issues of using high voltages or the complexity of other machines."" The researchers can use this method to create a variety of nanofibers simply by changing the polymer placed in the syringe. They can, for example, create specially designed nanofibers that will promote the growth of stem cells. Fibers like these are currently used to create scaffolding for lab-grown tissues and organs. Nanofibers can also be loaded with proteins, nanotubes, fluorescent materials and therapeutic agents. ""We can use almost any kind of polymer with this platform, and we can tailor make the nanofibers for different applications,"" explained Dr. Minko. ""It's like cooking. We just change the ingredients a bit, and the kind of fiber we get is very different.""","Published: May 22, 2015"

The results of this 12-month study show that the triptorelin 6-month formulation is efficacious in suppressing the pituitary release of LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and consequently the gonadal secretion of estradiol in girls and testosterone in boys to prepubertal levels, with favorable effects on progression of clinical signs of puberty and bone maturation. The percentage of children with prepubertal LH levels exceeded 93% at each time point on-treatment and reached 98% at Month 12 when all but one patient were suppressed. The clinical signs of puberty (Tanner) were stable or reduced in the vast majority of patients (89%) between baseline and Month 12. Administration of the triptorelin 6-month formulation was well tolerated and safe with no unexpected adverse events reported.  The reduced injection frequency has the potential advantage of improving compliance to treatment and increasing comfort for children with CPP, for which no other 6-month GnRH agonist formulation is currently approved.  says Dr Eija Lundstrom, Medical Director at Debiopharm.  We remain committed to developing treatments that improve the quality of life of patients. ","Published: May 22, 2015"

The immune system comprises a range of cell types that react to infections and other challenges, resulting in a powerful immune response with the aim of eradicating the infective agent or problem. Traditional methods of identifying and isolating these cells from blood usually involves labelling them with fluorescent or magnetically labelled antibodies. This new method demonstrates the ability to identify immune cells with absolutely no labelling at all, thus permitting rapid identification and further analysis to take place with no potential alteration to the cells. Raman scattering refers to light scattering from molecules in a sample where the light energy can be shifted up or down and recorded then as a  molecular fingerprint  that can be used for identification. Normally this process is very weak and further hampered by other background light (e.g. fluorescence). The team at Physics and Astronomy at St Andrews have developed WMRS which subtly changes (modulates) the incident laser light that in turn results in a modulation of  the Raman signal, allowing it to be extracted from any (stationary) interfering signal. This means more accurate diagnosis of the sample. The work was led by Dr Simon Powis of the School of Medicine, and Prof Kishan Dholakia of the School of Physics and Astronomy, and continues the close collaboration of medical scientists and physicists in the area of biophotonics pioneered by the University in recent years. Dr Powis, Reader in Immunology, said,  Under a normal light microscope these immune cells essentially all look identical. With this new method we can identify key cell types without any labelling.  Our next goal is to make a full catalogue of all the normal cell types of the immune system that can be detected in the bloodstream. Once we have this completed, we can then collaborate with our clinical colleagues to start identifying when these immune cells are altered, in conditions such as leukaemia and lymphoma, potentially providing a rapid detection system from just a small blood sample.  The research paper  The use of Wavelength Modulated Raman Spectroscopy in label-free identification of T lymphocyte subsets, Natural Killer cells and Dendritic cells  is published by the journal PLOS ONE.","Published: May 22, 2015"
6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-target-for-treating-rheumatoid-arthritis-203009,New Target for Treating Rheumatoid Arthritis Many affected individuals still suffer with progressive joint damage  despite treatment  This study has discovered a new treatment target which could open a door to preventing this ongoing damage  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Stiffness in the fingers and toes, swollen joints with pain that comes and goes, for many years these were often dismissed as signs of getting older. Now, we know that they could very well be the initial symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as the disease affects an estimated 1.3 million American adults between the ages of 30-60. Moreover, RA does not limit its effects to just the joints as it can lead to increased risk of heart attack, stroke and infections. RA in most cases can be controlled to some degree with current immunosuppressive therapies that reduce inflammation and ultimately help slow the progression of the disease. However, in many patients, damage within joints continues to progress even while they are undergoing drug therapy. Yet, researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LIAI), in collaboration with colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, believe they have identified a novel drug target that focuses on the cells that are directly responsible for cartilage damage in affected joints.     ""Unfortunately, for around 40 percent of patients, immune-targeted therapies are not sufficient to bring them into full remission,"" says the study's lead author Nunzio Bottini, M.D. Ph.D., associate professor at LIAI and UCSD. ""If we could add a drug that acts on a different target without increasing immune suppression it could be very valuable."" During the inflammatory process associated with RA, a specific set of cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) become mobilized. Typically, FLS are relatively quiescent, but have an important role in providing the lubrication fluid within joint. Upon activation however, FLS will invade the surrounding cartilage and secrete enzymes that break down the tissues and bones of the joint.     ""Even if your inflammation is completely under control with the help of current therapies and they are excellent the damage to the skeletal structure is not necessarily arrested in the long term because synoviocytes continue to cause damage,"" explained Dr. Bottini. ""And although synoviocytes are considered the main effectors of cartilage damage in rheumatoid arthritis there's no therapy directed against them."" Mobilization of FLS is controlled by a signal transduction cascade regulated by a key enzyme receptor called protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (RPTP ), which the researchers found to be highly expressed on the surface of FLS cells. ""RPTP  acts like an inhibitory signal that is precoded on the surface of these cells,"" explains Karen M. Doody, Ph.D, postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Bottini s laboratory and first author and first author on the current study.   Normally, RPTP  remains inactive on the cell surface through an interaction with surface proteoglycans. Dr. Doody found that if RPTP  is freed from the proteoglycans it can weaken the ability of FLS to aggressively invade the joints cartilage.   ""Being able to activate RPTP 's activity gives us a specific tool with which to adjust the migration and aggressiveness of synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis,"" said Dr. Doody. The investigators created a molecular decoy, synthesizing a small piece of RPTP s extracellular domain and flooding the proteoglycans with the molecule, which occupied the binding sites for RPTP , preventing it from being sequestered. Additionally, the researchers tested their assay on a preclinical model of RA and found that the phosphatase decoy was able to alleviate the disease symptoms. ""The ultimate goal is to use biologics that target synoviocytes in combination with treatments that suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate or anti-TNF, to address all three aspects of rheumatoid arthritis: swollen joints as a result of inflammation, cartilage damage and bone damage,"" concluded Dr. Bottini.","Published: May 22, 2015"

The study was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Science. More than 30,000 Americans live with ALS, which destroys nerves that control essential movements, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. After Alzheimer s disease, FTD is the most common form of early onset dementia. It is characterized by changes in personality, behavior and language due to loss of neurons in the brain s frontal and temporal lobes. Patients with mutations in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene have all or some symptoms associated with both disorders.  Our mouse model exhibits the pathologies and symptoms of ALS and FTD seen in patients with the C9ORF72 mutation,  said the study s lead author, Leonard Petrucelli, Ph.D., chair and Ralph and Ruth Abrams Professor of the Department of Neuroscience at Mayo Clinic, and a senior author of the study.  These mice could greatly improve our understanding of ALS and FTD and hasten the development of effective treatments.  To create the model, Ms. Jeannie Chew, a Mayo Graduate School student and member of Dr. Petrucelli s team, injected the brains of newborn mice with a disease-causing version of the C9ORF72 gene. As the mice aged, they became hyperactive, anxious, and antisocial, in addition to having problems with movement that mirrored patient symptoms. The brains of the mice were smaller than normal and had fewer neurons in areas that controlled the affected behaviors. The scientists also found that the mouse brains had key hallmarks of the disorders, including toxic clusters of ribonucleic acids (RNA) and TDP-43, a protein that has long been known to go awry in the majority of ALS and FTD cases.  This is a significant advancement for the field. Scientists have been trying to create mice that accurately mimic the pathologies associated with these forms of ALS and FTD,  said Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D., program director, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of NIH.  This mouse model will be a valuable tool for developing therapies for these devastating disorders.  The C9ORF72 gene is encoded by repeating strings of six DNA molecules. Disease-causing C9ORF72 mutations make the strings excessively long which leads to the accumulation of RNA that either cluster into structures, called foci, or cause the production of abnormal c9RAN proteins in the brain and spinal cord of patients. The scientists found both in the brains of the mice. They also found clumps, or inclusions, of TDP-43 protein which is another pathological hallmark found in patients with the C9ORF72 mutation.  Finding TDP-43 in these mice was unexpected  Dr. Petrucelli said.  We don t yet know how foci and c9RAN proteins are linked to TDP-43 abnormalities, but with our new animal model, we now have a way to find out.  Dr. Petrucelli and his team think these results are an important step in the development of therapies for these forms of ALS and FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders.","Published: May 22, 2015"

Continuous manufacturing represents the future of advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing and will produce significant improvements in efficiency, safety, cost and speed to market. Our center is now better positioned than ever to serve the scientific community, the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory agencies.  The Rutgers ERC, established nine years ago with funding from the National Science Foundation and a consortium of more than 40 companies within the pharmaceutical sector, is the world s largest academic-based research organization dedicated to modernizing pharmaceutical manufacturing of solid oral dose medications. The funding from Janssen represents a significant expansion of an arrangement that began five years ago and that focuses on technical development of continuous processing, an emerging advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing method.  Our collaboration with the Rutgers Engineering School has been very productive in helping us to prepare for the future in delivering the highest quality medicines in the most efficient way,  said Mauricio Futran, vice president, advanced technology, Janssen Manufacturing & Technical Operations.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Rutgers and with regulators on the advancement and implementation of this important manufacturing technology.  As part of this collaboration, Rutgers engineers designed and built one of the first full production-scale continuous direct compression solid oral dosage manufacturing facilities, which was used as the model for the Janssen production line in Puerto Rico and is also being used as a model by other pharmaceutical manufacturers. This direct compression tableting line, located at the engineering school campus in Piscataway, has now been expanded to also include wet and dry granulated products and can accommodate tests of multiple production routes under automated control for optimal product and process design. Continuous manufacturing offers a number of significant benefits, and over time, is likely to replace conventional batch processing for many products. The pharmaceutical industry has been slow to adopt this technology, which is the standard in many other industries. However, in recent years the pace has accelerated following explicit support from the FDA for these processes. Since the center s founding, researchers at Rutgers have worked in collaboration with industry and its partner universities Purdue, NJIT, and the University of Puerto Rico to develop an understanding of the science that goes into designing and operating continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems for solid oral dosage forms. The Rutgers group has been researching a wide variety of areas, including powder processing and materials properties, process modeling and control, and in-line process analytical technology in order to design and implement robust and reliable manufacturing processes that meet the quality standards of a regulated industry at lower cost. The Rutgers center offers capabilities for research, experience in innovative processes and products, extensive experience and capabilities in process modeling and strong relationships with the FDA.  The center is helping manufacturers meet new regulatory requirements by using good science and state-of-the-art research to promote and maintain high standards of product safety and efficacy,  Muzzio said.  Our ongoing collaboration with Janssen allows us to continue to increase product quality and lower process risk and provide science-based data to the FDA and other regulatory agencies to improve the way pharmaceuticals products are manufactured.

""Our mouse model exhibits the pathologies and symptoms of ALS and FTD seen in patients with the C9ORF72 mutation,"" said the study's lead author, Leonard Petrucelli, Ph.D., chair and Ralph and Ruth Abrams Professor of the Department of Neuroscience at Mayo Clinic, and a senior author of the study. ""These mice could greatly improve our understanding of ALS and FTD and hasten the development of effective treatments."" To create the model, Ms. Jeannie Chew, a Mayo Graduate School student and member of Dr. Petrucelli's team, injected the brains of newborn mice with a disease-causing version of the C9ORF72 gene. As the mice aged, they became hyperactive, anxious, and antisocial, in addition to having problems with movement that mirrored patient symptoms. The brains of the mice were smaller than normal and had fewer neurons in areas that controlled the affected behaviors. The scientists also found that the mouse brains had key hallmarks of the disorders, including toxic clusters of ribonucleic acids (RNA) and TDP-43, a protein that has long been known to go awry in the majority of ALS and FTD cases. ""This is a significant advancement for the field. Scientists have been trying to create mice that accurately mimic the pathologies associated with these forms of ALS and FTD,"" said Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D., program director, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of NIH. ""This mouse model will be a valuable tool for developing therapies for these devastating disorders."" The C9ORF72 gene is encoded by repeating strings of six DNA molecules. Disease-causing C9ORF72 mutations make the strings excessively long which leads to the accumulation of RNA that either cluster into structures, called foci, or cause the production of abnormal c9RAN proteins in the brain and spinal cord of patients. The scientists found both in the brains of the mice. They also found clumps, or inclusions, of TDP-43 protein which is another pathological hallmark found in patients with the C9ORF72 mutation. ""Finding TDP-43 in these mice was unexpected"" Dr. Petrucelli said. ""We don't yet know how foci and c9RAN proteins are linked to TDP-43 abnormalities, but with our new animal model, we now have a way to find out."" Dr. Petrucelli and his team think these results are an important step in the development of therapies for these forms of ALS and FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

However, current neuroprosthetics produce motion that is delayed and jerky not the smooth and seemingly automatic gestures associated with natural movement. Now, by implanting neuroprosthetics in a part of the brain that controls not the movement directly but rather our intent to move, California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers have developed a way to produce more natural and fluid motions. In a clinical trial, the Caltech team and colleagues from Keck Medicine of University of Southern California (USC) have successfully implanted just such a device in a patient with quadriplegia, giving him the ability to perform a fluid hand-shaking gesture and even play ""rock, paper, scissors"" using a separate robotic arm. The results of the trial, led by principal investigator Richard Andersen, the James G. Boswell Professor of Neuroscience, and including Caltech lab members Tyson Aflalo, Spencer Kellis, Christian Klaes, Brian Lee, Ying Shi and Kelsie Pejsa, are published in the journal Science. ""When you move your arm, you really don't think about which muscles to activate and the details of the movement such as lift the arm, extend the arm, grasp the cup, close the hand around the cup, and so on. Instead, you think about the goal of the movement. For example, 'I want to pick up that cup of water,'"" Andersen says. ""So in this trial, we were successfully able to decode these actual intents, by asking the subject to simply imagine the movement as a whole, rather than breaking it down into myriad components."" For example, the process of seeing a person and then shaking his hand begins with a visual signal (for example, recognizing someone you know) that is first processed in the lower visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The signal then moves up to a high-level cognitive area known as the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Here, the initial intent to make a movement is formed. These intentions are then transmitted to the motor cortex, through the spinal cord, and on to the arms and legs where the movement is executed. High spinal cord injuries can cause quadriplegia in some patients because movement signals cannot get from the brain to the arms and legs. As a solution, earlier neuroprosthetic implants used tiny electrodes to detect and record movement signals at their last stop before reaching the spinal cord: the motor cortex. The recorded signal is then carried via wire bundles from the patient's brain to a computer, where it is translated into an instruction for a robotic limb. However, because the motor cortex normally controls many muscles, the signals tend to be detailed and specific. The Caltech group wanted to see if the simpler intent to shake the hand could be used to control the prosthetic limb, instead of asking the subject to concentrate on each component of the handshake a more painstaking and less natural approach. Andersen and his colleagues wanted to improve the versatility of movement that a neuroprosthetic can offer by recording signals from a different brain region the PPC. ""The PPC is earlier in the pathway, so signals there are more related to movement planning what you actually intend to do rather than the details of the movement execution,"" he says. ""We hoped that the signals from the PPC would be easier for the patients to use, ultimately making the movement process more intuitive. Our future studies will investigate ways to combine the detailed motor cortex signals with more cognitive PPC signals to take advantage of each area's specializations."" In the clinical trial, designed to test the safety and effectiveness of this new approach, the Caltech team collaborated with surgeons at Keck Medicine of USC and the rehabilitation team at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. The surgeons implanted a pair of small electrode arrays in two parts of the PPC of a quadriplegic patient. Each array contains 96 active electrodes that, in turn, each record the activity of a single neuron in the PPC. The arrays were connected by a cable to a system of computers that processed the signals, decoded the intent of the subject, and controlled output devices that included a computer cursor and a robotic arm developed by collaborators at Johns Hopkins University. After recovering from the surgery, the patient was trained to control the computer cursor and the robotic arm with his mind. Once training was complete, the researchers saw just what they were hoping for: intuitive movement of the robotic arm. ""For me, the most exciting moment of the trial was when the participant first moved the robotic limb with his thoughts. He had been paralyzed for over 10 years, and this was the first time since his injury that he could move a limb and reach out to someone. It was a thrilling moment for all of us,"" Andersen says. ""It was a big surprise that the patient was able to control the limb on day one the very first day he tried,"" he adds. ""This attests to how intuitive the control is when using PPC activity."" The patient, Erik G. Sorto, was also thrilled with the quick results: ""I was surprised at how easy it was,"" he says. ""I remember just having this out-of-body experience, and I wanted to just run around and high-five everybody."" Over time, Sorto continued to refine his control of his robotic arm, thus providing the researchers with more information about how the PPC works. For example, ""we learned that if he thought, 'I should move my hand over toward to the object in a certain way' trying to control the limb that didn't work,"" Andersen says. ""The thought actually needed to be more cognitive. But if he just thought, 'I want to grasp the object,' it was much easier. And that is exactly what we would expect from this area of the brain."" This better understanding of the PPC will help the researchers improve neuroprosthetic devices of the future, Andersen says. ""What we have here is a unique window into the workings of a complex high-level brain area as we work collaboratively with our subject to perfect his skill in controlling external devices."" ""The primary mission of the USC Neurorestoration Center is to take advantage of resources from our clinical programs to create unique opportunities to translate scientific discoveries, such as those of the Andersen Lab at Caltech, to human patients, ultimately turning transformative discoveries into effective therapies,"" says center director Charles Y. Liu, professor of neurological surgery, neurology, and biomedical engineering at USC, who led the surgical implant procedure and the USC/Rancho Los Amigos team in the collaboration. ""In taking care of patients with neurological injuries and diseases and knowing the significant limitations of current treatment strategies it is clear that completely new approaches are necessary to restore function to paralyzed patients. Direct brain control of robots and computers has the potential to dramatically change the lives of many people,"" Liu adds. Dr. Mindy Aisen, the chief medical officer at Rancho Los Amigos who led the study's rehabilitation team, says that advancements in prosthetics like these hold promise for the future of patient rehabilitation. ""We at Rancho are dedicated to advancing rehabilitation through new assistive technologies, such as robotics and brain-machine interfaces. We have created a unique environment that can seamlessly bring together rehabilitation, medicine, and science as exemplified in this study,"" she says. Although tasks like shaking hands and playing ""rock, paper, scissors"" are important to demonstrate the capability of these devices, the hope is that neuroprosthetics will eventually enable patients to perform more practical tasks that will allow them to regain some of their independence. ""This study has been very meaningful to me. As much as the project needed me, I needed the project. The project has made a huge difference in my life. It gives me great pleasure to be part of the solution for improving paralyzed patients' lives,"" Sorto says. ""I joke around with the guys that I want to be able to drink my own beer to be able to take a drink at my own pace, when I want to take a sip out of my beer and to not have to ask somebody to give it to me. I really miss that independence. I think that if it was safe enough, I would really enjoy grooming myself shaving, brushing my own teeth. That would be fantastic.""  To that end, Andersen and his colleagues are already working on a strategy that could enable patients to perform these finer motor skills. The key is to be able to provide particular types of sensory feedback from the robotic arm to the brain. Although Sorto's implant allowed him to control larger movements with visual feedback, ""to really do fine dexterous control, you also need feedback from touch,"" Andersen says. ""Without it, it's like going to the dentist and having your mouth numbed. It's very hard to speak without somatosensory feedback."" The newest devices under development by Andersen and his colleagues feature a mechanism to relay signals from the robotic arm back into the part of the brain that gives the perception of touch.

Specifically, stem cell scientists at McMaster can now directly convert adult human blood cells to both central nervous system neurons as well as neurons in the peripheral nervous system that are responsible for pain, temperature and itch perception. This means that how a person's nervous system cells react and respond to stimuli, can be determined from his blood. The breakthrough, published online today and featured on the cover of the journal Cell Reports, was led by Mick Bhatia, director of the McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute. He holds the Canada Research Chair in Human Stem Cell Biology and is a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences of the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine. Also playing a key role was Karun Singh, a co-author in the study and holder of the David Braley Chair in Human Stem Cell Research. Currently, scientists and physicians have a limited understanding of the complex issue of pain and how to treat it. The peripheral nervous system is made up of different types of nerves -- some are mechanical (feel pressure) and others detect temperature (heat). In extreme conditions, pain or numbness is perceived by the brain using signals sent by these peripheral nerves. ""The problem is that unlike blood, a skin sample or even a tissue biopsy, you can't take a piece of a patient's neural system. It runs like complex wiring throughout the body and portions cannot be sampled for study,"" said Bhatia. ""Now we can take easy to obtain blood samples, and make the main cell types of neurological systems -- the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system -- in a dish that is specialized for each patient,"" said Bhatia. ""Nobody has ever done this with adult blood. Ever. ""We can actually take a patient's blood sample, as routinely performed in a doctor's office, and with it we can produce one million sensory neurons, that make up the peripheral nerves in short order with this new approach. We can also make central nervous system cells, as the blood to neural conversion technology we developed creates neural stem cells during the process of conversion."" His team's revolutionary, patented direct conversion technology has ""broad and immediate applications,"" said Bhatia, adding that it allows researchers to start asking questions about understanding disease and improving treatments such as: Why is it that certain people feel pain versus numbness? Is this something genetic? Can the neuropathy that diabetic patients experience be mimicked in a dish? It also paves the way for the discovery of new pain drugs that don't just numb the perception of pain. Bhatia said non-specific opioids used for decades are still being used today. ""If I was a patient and I was feeling pain or experiencing neuropathy, the prized pain drug for me would target the peripheral nervous system neurons, but do nothing to the central nervous system, thus avoiding non-addictive drug side effects,"" said Bhatia. ""You don't want to feel sleepy or unaware, you just want your pain to go away. But, up until now, no one's had the ability and required technology to actually test different drugs to find something that targets the peripheral nervous system and not the central nervous system in a patient specific, or personalized manner."" Bhatia's team successfully tested their process using fresh blood, but also cryopreserved (frozen) blood. Since blood samples are taken and frozen with many clinical trials, this allows them ""almost a bit of a time machine"" to go back and explore questions around pain or neuropathy to run tests on neurons created from blood samples of patients taken in past clinical trials where responses and outcomes have already been recorded."" In the future, the process may have prognostic potential, explained Bhatia, in that one might be able to look at a patient with Type 2 Diabetes and predict whether they will experience neuropathy by running tests in the lab using their own neural cells derived from their blood sample. ""This bench to bedside research is very exciting and will have a major impact on the management of neurological diseases, particularly neuropathic pain,"" said Akbar Panju, medical director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Pain Research and Care, a clinician and professor of medicine. ""This research will help us understand the response of cells to different drugs and different stimulation responses, and allow us to provide individualized or personalized medical therapy for patients suffering with neuropathic pain.""

Among other applications, it is used to map brain tumors before an operation and to test whether important regions of the brain, for example motor and language areas, are affected. Doctors at the Technische Universit t M nchen (TUM) have now shown that preoperative nTMS analysis of motor areas improves the prognosis of patients with malignant brain tumors. With the help of nTMS, it is possible to identify what areas of the brain control motor or language function to an accuracy of four millimeters.  That s particularly important, as it enables the removal of tumors from patients without affecting functional areas while at the same time removing as much of the malignant tissue as possible,  explains Dr. Sandro Krieg, working group leader at the Department of Neurosurgery of TUM University Hospital Klinikum rechts der Isar and head of the study. Mapping must be performed separately for each patient, as tumors can displace important brain areas from their original sites. To determine motor areas with the nTMS technique, the physician scans points at defined positions on the patient s head using a coil. The coil induces brief painless electrical pulses in the brain, which stimulate brain neurons at those positions. If the pulses at a given position point activate neurons that trigger muscle movements, the scientists are able to measure the muscle activities with the help of electrodes fastened to the patient s arms and legs. That position is then regarded as an essential location for motor activity. Up to 150 individual position points per patient can be analyzed and mapped.  In this way, we can draw up a map of important motor areas and nerve pathways in the vicinity of the tumor. During the operation, this data is a good guide as to where we can and cannot cut,  explains Krieg. The method has been used at Klinikum rechts der Isar since 2010. In their recent study, Sandro Krieg and his team scanned and mapped motor areas in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG), which are usually associated with a poor prognosis. They compared two groups: 70 subjects who underwent preoperative nTMS analysis and 70 patients who underwent tumor surgery before nTMS became a standard procedure in the hospital. The results of the study show the advantage of nTMS mapping for patients compared to the control group: smaller openings in the skull had to be made in patients who underwent nTMS tumor analysis, and residual tumor tissue was left behind less frequently. In addition, their average hospitalization period was two days shorter. Because the general state of health of the nTMS-treated patients was also better, an increased number of them were subsequently able to receive radiotherapy. Above all, those patients survived several months longer than the control group.  Of course, we need to confirm the findings in larger patient groups, but one important thing is clear: preoperative tumor mapping positively influences many aspects of the procedure,  Krieg says about the results, adding:  Some tumors that are otherwise thought to be inoperable can be removed by this method.  The scientists now aim to improve standard protocols for nTMS and, for example, the mapping of language areas. In a recent study, they showed that an object-naming test is the best method for analyzing language centers.  Language areas can already be mapped with nTMS, but they re much more complex than motor areas. We want to create higher standards in order to help patients with tumors in these regions as effectively as possible,  the scientist says.

During their research, the scientists also managed for the first time to observe the formation of microdroplet structures with unexpected shapes. It has long been known that it is possible to place inside the drop of one liquid a certain number of droplets of another immiscible liquid. It is also known that under certain conditions the internal droplets can arrange themselves into stable structures. Until now, however, it was assumed that the shapes of these structures depended only on the number of droplets forming them. As a result, the number of different structures of mesoscale atoms it was possible to obtain was very limited.  We have shown that the shapes of the structures that spontaneously arrange themselves inside the drops depend not only on their number, but also on the relative proportions of their volume. The existence of the second parameter significantly enhances the ability to form new mesoscale atoms. As a result, we now have at our disposal a spontaneous process with a rich potential, and one that we can to an extent control,  says Prof. Piotr Garstecki (IPC PAS). Stable structures of droplets within drops are produced at IPC PAS with the help of microfluidic systems. Systems of this type are typically formed by two plates of plastic. A network of carefully designed grooves is applied to one plate and the second fulfils the role of the 'lid'. After securing the two plates together the grooves become channels with sub-millimeter diameters, filled with a carrier fluid. If small portions of working fluid, immiscible with the carrier fluid, are injected into the microchannels, droplets form. The techniques developed at IPC PAS make it possible to precisely control the motion of multiple tiny segments of liquids.  In the course of our research we injected equal, small portions of dyed water, one straight after another, into a channel filled with oil. Since oil is immiscible with water, a 'string' was created of a number of blue, virtually identical, microdroplets. Interesting things started to happen when such a droplet 'train', flowing in oil of one type, was injected into a channel filled with another oil immiscible with the other two fluids,  says Dr. Jan Guzowski. The surface tension of the liquid shell around the encapsulated droplets caused it to itself form a drop. During this process, the encapsulated microdroplets were subjected to considerable forces, became deformed, and organized in order to minimize the energy of the surface constraining them. Depending on the configuration the number of droplets within the drop and the ratio between the volumes of all the droplets a unique structure of a mesoscale atom formed. The researchers could observe a number of distinct geometries of the atoms. A real surprise was that they could also observe structures containing all core droplets arranged in a row, one after another, just like peas in a pod.  The configuration wherein a few droplets form a row only seems to be unstable. Our calculations show that in order to stick together in a cluster, the aligned droplets would have to undergo deformation 'on the way' requiring an input of additional energy. The flow carrying the droplets is not strong enough for this and as a result the droplets remain frozen in the original arrangement. Finally, the whole structure looks like a group of several tennis balls pushed one the after the other into a tight shirt sleeve,  says Dr. Guzowski and emphasizes that the existence of capillary barriers, preventing the spontaneous reconfiguration of the structure of microdroplets, has been presented for the first time. The mesoscale atoms of droplets within drops obtained by the team from IPC PAS had just sub- millimeter dimensions, and were thus relatively large.  Laboratory experiments are easier to perform on larger drops and in a manner that permits their easy observation,  explains Prof. Garstecki and points out:  There are, however, no fundamental obstacles to reducing the droplet size by one or two orders of magnitude. The capillary forces that are responsible for the formation of structures are even stronger at small scales. We expect, therefore, that the process should be faster, and even more controllable when targeting sizes significantly below the millimeter scale.  The  controlled  production  of  mesoscale  atoms  from  droplets  is  of  particular  importance  for materials science. This is because materials come into being in a manner somewhat similar to structures made of building blocks: they are 'made up' of many smaller 'bricks' tightly packed clusters of particles or atoms. A promising area of use seems to be the transport of drugs to specific areas of the body. Each drop in the mesoscale atom could contain various therapeutic substances which would be released under different conditions. This sort of 'smart' container for medicines could carry out carefully planned drug therapy in a selected organ in the human body.","Published: May 21, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/animals-presence-may-ease-social-anxiety-kids-autism-283262,Animals  presence may ease social anxiety in kids with autism NIH funded study could have implications for treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. NIH-funded study could have implications for treatment When animals are present, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have lower readings on a device that detects anxiety and other forms of social arousal when interacting with their peers. According to a study funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), companion animals like dogs, cats or the guinea pigs in the study may prove to be a helpful addition to treatment programs designed to help children with ASDs improve their social skills and interactions with other people. The study, published online in Developmental Psychobiology, was conducted by Marguerite O Haire, Ph.D., from the Center for the Human-Animal Bond in the College of Veterinary Medicine of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and colleagues in the School of Psychology at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.  Previous studies suggest that in the presence of companion animals, children with autism spectrum disorders function better socially,  said James Griffin, Ph.D., of the Child Development and Behavior Branch at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).   This study provides physiological evidence that the proximity of animals eases the stress that children with autism may experience in social situations.  This study is among several funded under a public-private partnership established in 2008 between NICHD and the WALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition, a division of Mars Inc., to establish a human-animal interaction research program to support studies relevant to child development, health, and the therapeutic use of animals. By providing support for these research studies, we hope to generate more definitive answers about how human-animal interaction affects health,  he said.ASDs affect the structure and function of the brain and nervous system.  People with these conditions have difficulty communicating and interacting with other people. They also have restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors. For the current study, Dr. O Haire and her colleagues measured skin conductance, the ease at which an unnoticeable electric charge passes through a patch of skin, in children with ASDs and in typically developing children. Researchers divided the 114 children, ages 5 to 12 years old, into 38 groups of three. Each group included one child with ASD and two of their typically developing peers. Each child wore a wrist band fitted with a device that measures skin conductance. When people are feeling excited, fearful, or anxious, the electric charge travels faster through the skin, providing an objective way for researchers to gauge social anxiety and other forms of psychological arousal. For the first few minutes, the children read a book silently, giving researchers a baseline measure of skin conductance while carrying out a non-stressful, familiar task. Next, each child was asked to read aloud from the book in the presence of the two peers in their group, a task designed to measure their level of apprehension during social situations. The researchers then brought toys in the room and allowed the children 10 minutes of free play time. These situations may be stressful for children with ASDs, who may have difficulty relating socially to their typically developing peers. Finally, the researchers brought two guinea pigs into the room and allowed the children to have 10 minutes of supervised play with the animals.  The researchers chose guinea pigs because of their small size and docile nature  much easier to manage in a classroom than larger animals.  The researchers found that, compared to the typically developing children, the children with autism had higher skin conductance levels when reading silently, reading aloud, and in the group toy session. These higher levels are consistent with reports from parents and teachers, and from other studies, that children with ASDs are more likely to be anxious in social situations than typically developing children.  When the session with the guinea pigs began, however, skin conductance levels among the children with ASDs dropped significantly. The researchers speculate that because companion animals offer unqualified acceptance, their presence makes the children feel more secure.Whereas human counterparts inherently pass social judgment, animals are often perceived as sources of unconditional, positive support, the researchers wrote. For reasons the researchers can not explain, skin conductance levels in the typically developing children rose during the session with the guinea pigs. The researchers believe that these higher readings may indicate excitement at seeing the animals, rather than any nervousness or apprehension. Dr. O Haire added that earlier studies have shown that children with ASDs were less likely to withdraw from social situations when companion animals are present. These studies, along with the current findings, indicate that animals might  play a part in interventions seeking to help children with autism develop their social skills,  she said. She cautioned, however, that the findings do not mean that parents of children with ASDs should rush to buy an animal for their children. Further research is needed to determine how animals might be used in programs aimed at developing social skills.  Our study was conducted in a supervised setting, by researchers experienced in working with kids with autism spectrum disorders who understand the needs and requirements of the animals,  Dr. O Haire said. She added that careful supervision was provided during the study, to ensure the welfare of the children as well as the animals.

The goal of the new online platform protocols.io is to provide scientists the ability to easily share experimental methods, including any improvements made to them. Lenny Teytelman, co-founder of protocols.io, spent over a year of his postdoctoral research at MIT discovering that a single step of a commonly used scientific method had been incorrectly documented.  I realized there was no easy way for researchers to share such knowledge with their peers, as well as the broader scientific community,  Lenny explains.  Scientists are constantly re-discovering what others have not had the time to publish, and improving existing methods without the ability to share these improvements with the world. Academic publishing has hardly changed from the days of Mendel, and the purpose of protocols.io is to bring scientific communication into the 21st century,  Lenny continues. As part of the partnership, NEB has been working with protocols.io to add the most popular NEB protocols to the platform. These protocols are not just viewable, but can be  followed  (step-by-step), either on the protocols.io website or mobile device, while the scientist is actually doing the work. This allows the researcher to track where they are in the given method and to record any changes that they introduce. More importantly, this will enable scientists to change the protocols online, according to their needs. Scientists will then be able to keep those modifications private or share them publicly, as well as find comments, optimizations and/or other updates from other scientists, including those at NEB.  NEB was the first commercial player to work with protocols.io and has been very supportive of our project over the past year.

""People have used microfluidic devices before to look at the movement of cells, but the story typically ended there. We developed a device that separates the mobile cells and allows us to determine the gene expression of those highly mobile cells in comparison to the less mobile ones. By studying these differences in live cells, we hope to gain an understanding of what makes some cancer cells able to spread to other areas of the body,"" says study co-lead author Steven G. Allen, an M.D.-Ph.D. student in the University of Michigan Medical School's Medical Scientist Training Program. The highly mobile cells are believed to be the more aggressive cells that cause metastases. By understanding how those cells tick, researchers believe they can develop targeted treatments to try to prevent metastasis. ""Using advanced micro-fabrication technologies, we can create micro-structures comparable to the size of cells. Living cells can then be manipulated on-chip at single-cell resolution. Using this technology, we can investigate the differences among individual cancer cells, while conventional approaches can study only the collective average behaviors,"" says study co-lead author Yu-Chih Chen, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. The differences in individual cancer cells are a key aspect of how cancer evolves, becomes resistant to current therapies or recurs. ""A primary tumor is not what kills patients. Metastases are what kill patients. Understanding which cells are likely to metastasize can help us direct more targeted therapies to patients,"" says co-senior study author Sofia D. Merajver, M.D., Ph.D., scientific director of the breast oncology program at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. The researchers believe this type of device might someday help doctors understand an individual patient's cancer. Which cells in this patient's tumor are really causing havoc? Is there a large population of aggressive cells? Are there specific markers or variants on those individual cells that could be targeted with treatment? ""This work demonstrates an elegant approach to the study of cancer cell metastasis by combining expertise in engineering and biology,"" says study co-senior author Euisik Yoon, Ph.D., professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of biomedical engineering and director of the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility at the U-M College of Engineering. ""In past decades, engineers have developed biological tools with better resolution, higher sensitivity, selectivity and higher throughput. However, without compelling applications, these engineering tools have little practical relevance. The goal of our lab is to develop tools that can be widely disseminated to the biology community to eventually impact clinical care for patients."" In this work, extensive studies were performed on cell lines representing various types of cancer. The new device was designed to trace how cells move, sorting individual cells by their movement. It has a series of choke points that mimic the lymphatic systems in which cancer cells typically travel. Unlike other similar devices, in this case the captured and sorted cells can be harvested live for further study and analysis. In a test using aggressive metastatic breast cancer cells, the researchers were able to sort the cells based on their motion, collect the sorted cells and send them through the device again. The cells maintained the same highly mobile characteristic upon repeated testing. The researchers also found that the more mobile cells had the characteristics and appearance under the microscope of metastatic cells and expressed significantly higher levels of markers associated with metastatic cancer. ""Understanding specific differences that lead some cancer cells to leave the primary tumor and seed metastases is of great benefit to develop and test anti-metastatic strategies,"" says Dr. Merajver, who adds that the device needs further testing and validation before it can begin to influence clinical care.","Published: May 21, 2015"

Approximately one-third of the world's population is infected by this bacteria, which is increasingly becoming resistant to the current five-drug cocktail used to treat these infections. This issue is sparking serious concern in world health organizations and medical communities as they no longer have an effective cure for many of these patients. These studies expand on previously published experiments demonstrating Nu-3 to be effective in killing multi-drug resistant bacteria and highlight the potential of this important new class of antimicrobials. Specifically, the time-kill studies revealed that Nu-3 was highly effective, generating a 100 percent kill rate with as little as a 15-minute incubation against MDR-TB strains CSU 39 and CSU 41   both of which are resistant to more than six classes of antibiotics   and wild type strain H37Rv.   This result highlights the novel directly bactericidal mechanism of action of the bisphosphocin class, which is time and concentration dependent, resulting in killing of gram positive and gram negative bacteria in less time than they take to replicate.     Lakewood-Amedex believes the bisphosphocin class of antimicrobials has the ability to significantly change how infections are treated and overcome the ability of bacteria to become resistant.  In previously conducted studies published in a peer-reviewed journal, bisphosphocin Nu-3 was shown to eradicate a Pseudomonal lung infection with a single aerosolized dose. This result is significant because bisphosphocins can eradicate slow growing or stationary bacteria, such as Mycobacterium, eliminating any opportunity for the development of resistance. Based on this data, an aerosolized solo Nu-3 treatment would be expected to dramatically reduce the current tuberculosis treatment regime, which is composed of a five-drug cocktail administered for up to six months or longer if the strains are found to be MDR-TB or extensively drug-resistant (XDR).   The Company is developing Nu-3 as an intravenous formulation for serious bacterial infections, such as complicated urinary tract infections, and a topical formulation for difficult to treat infections, such as chronic infected diabetic foot ulcers, fungal infections, and ophthalmic infections where a broad spectrum of activity is required.

There currently is no cure for the condition, but researchers from the University of Missouri have identified a key component in the protein that causes the disease.  We know that cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a gene called CFTR, but we don t know exactly how these mutations affect the function of the CFTR protein,  said Tzyh-Chang Hwang, Ph.D., professor of medical pharmacology and physiology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study.  In fact, there are nearly 2,000 mutations that could occur in the protein. However, our study identified two amino acids in the CFTR protein that serve as a sort of gate. This gate is a key factor in regulating the flow of chloride ions   one of the key ingredients in salt   into and out of the cells through the CFTR protein.  People with cystic fibrosis have an imbalance of salt in their bodies caused by the defective CFTR protein. Because there is too little salt and water on the outside of the cells, the thin layer of mucus that helps keep the lungs free of bacteria becomes very thick and difficult to expel by coughing. This thick mucus can clog the airways and lead to dangerous infections. Although advances in the understanding and treatment of the condition have allowed many people with the disease to live into their early 40s, the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis die of respiratory failure.  In many ways, the function of the CFTR protein can be compared to a motion-activated water faucet,  Hwang said.  All of the parts need to be functioning properly in order for the faucet to work. The motion sensor needs to detect your hand movements and send a signal to open the gate, enabling the flow of water. When the gate in the CFTR protein is defective, the flow of ions across the cell membrane is disrupted. By identifying the amino acids that make up this gate, we now have a clear idea as to why a mutation in either of these two amino acids causes cystic fibrosis.  For decades, therapies for cystic fibrosis worked to maximize organ function and stave off organ failure, but did not address the root causes of the disease. However, in 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, ivacaftor, to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in individuals with a specific mutation. While the drug targets the defective protein, the actual ways by which it enhances CFTR function are largely unknown. Hwang s previous research has shown how the drug affects the CFTR protein s gate, and his latest study builds upon that knowledge by identifying the exact location of the gate. This allows Hwang and his team to further understand not only how the drug works, but also could shed light on where the drug works and therefore potentially improve upon its effects.    When your water faucet is broken, you can call a plumber to repair it,  Hwang said.  But if the plumber doesn t understand how the faucet works, how is he supposed to fix it? By understanding the physical and chemical basis of CFTR function, we, the molecular plumbers, are equipped with the tools to find ways to correct the defective protein s function, and subsequently boost treatments and ultimately improve the lives of cystic fibrosis patients.

Though the cancer protection offered by the Hib vaccine has been well established in epidemiological studies, it is not well-known among the public at large, and the mechanism underlying this effect has been poorly understood. Now, in work to be reported on May 18 in Nature Immunology, an international team led by UCSF researchers has shown that recurrent Hib infections can put certain immune-system genes into overdrive, converting  pre-leukemia  blood cells   which are present in a surprisingly large number of newborns   into full-blown cancer.  These experiments help explain why the incidence of leukemia has been dramatically reduced since the advent of regular vaccinations during infancy,  said Markus M schen, MD, PhD, professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF and senior author of the study.  Hib and other childhood infections can cause recurrent and vehement immune responses, which we have found could lead to leukemia, but infants that have received vaccines are largely protected and acquire long-term immunity through very mild immune reactions.  Many newborns carry oncogenes   genes that could potentially cause cancer   in their blood cells, but only one in 10,000 will eventually develop ALL. In the new study, the researchers tested the idea that chronic inflammation caused by recurrent infections might cause  collateral damage    additional genetic lesions   in blood cells already carrying an oncogene, promoting their transformation to overt disease. Led by co-first authors Srividya Swaminathan, PhD, a former UCSF postdoctoral fellow now at Stanford University School of Medicine, and Lars Klemm, assistant research specialist at UCSF, the research team conducted experiments with mice that homed in on two enzymes known as AID and RAG as the drivers of this process. AID and RAG introduce mutations in DNA that allow immune cells to adapt to infectious challenges, and these enzymes are necessary for a normal and efficient immune response. But in the presence of chronic infection, the group found, AID and RAG are strongly hyperactivated, and they cut and mutate genes randomly, including important gatekeepers against cancer. By studying genetically engineered pre-leukemia cells lacking either AID or RAG, as well as cells lacking both enzymes, the team found that AID and RAG working together is critical to introduce the additional lesions that result in life-threatening disease. Though the researchers focused on Hib, a bacterial infection, they believe that the same mechanisms may be at work in viral infections. The team is currently conducting experiments to determine if protection against leukemia is also provided by vaccines against viral infections, such as the well known MMR vaccine at the center of recent anti-vaccination controversies. Mel F. Greaves, MD, PhD, professor of cell biology at the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, is among the scientists who developed the theory that chronic and recurrent immune reactions during infancy promote cancer in children and one of the co-authors of the study.  The study provides mechanistic support for the hypothesis that infection or inflammation promotes the evolution of childhood leukemia and that the timing of common infections in early life is critical,  said Greaves. Also participating in the research were scientists from the University of Freiburg; Cambridge University; the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; the University of Southern California; Heinrich-Heine-Universit t D sseldorf; the University of Ulm; the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; and Yale School of Medicine.

Their findings suggest that computer-redesigned antibodies may speed the search for an effective therapy or vaccine for a virus that so far has eluded all attempts to eradicate it. ""There's a consensus (in the HIV field) that the vaccine that works is going to be a designed one,"" said James Crowe Jr., director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center who led the work with Jens Meiler, associate professor of Chemistry and Pharmacology. Working with colleagues at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, the Vanderbilt researchers began with a ""parent"" antibody isolated from the blood of an HIV-infected person that was a strong ""neutralizer"" of HIV in laboratory tests. The researchers then used the Rosetta computer program, which can predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, to ""redesign"" the antibody. By changing a single amino acid, they were able to increase the stability of the antibody when it bound to HIV's envelope protein. The researchers didn't change the interface between the antibody and the virus. Rather, by increasing its thermodynamic stability, the antibody became more rigid and better able to fit the HIV protein like a lock and key. ""By changing a single amino acid, we made it four times more potent, four times stronger and it also started killing even more HIV strains than the parent antibody,"" said Crowe, Ann Scott Carell Professor and professor of Pediatrics and of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology. The original, isolated antibody is now being produced in great quantities from a single clone of immune cells, and thus is a ""monoclonal"" antibody. It currently is being tested in clinical trials. Crowe said the redesigned antibody could be added to the study as a second-generation version. The field of redesigning antibodies has grown quickly out of the need to treat and prevent debilitating and often-fatal viral infections, and from technological advances that have made it possible to ""see"" and strengthen the interactions between virus and virus-killing antibodies. HIV is a wily opponent. Every day it evolves, or alters the envelope protein on its surface, to evade immune detection. A single person infected with HIV carries more variations of the virus than all the influenza strains isolated worldwide, Crowe said. The immune system simply cannot keep up. In 2013, Scripps scientists led by Ian Wilson and Andrew Ward, reported in the journal Science the structure of the HIV envelope protein using crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. ""Now we know what it looks like,"" Crowe said. ""We can better understand how to target it."" Last year, Crowe and another colleague at Scripps, William Schief, reported in the journal Nature that ""computational protein design"" can be used to induce potent neutralizing antibodies of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a leading cause of respiratory infections in young children. ""That was the first paper in which people agreed that computer design of a vaccine worked,"" he said. Structure and proof of principle in hand, scientists are now using the computer to generate neutralizing antibodies against parts of the envelope protein that don't change. Down the road, Crowe said, ""if computational design ... can predict how viruses evolve in the future, we could potentially design antibodies and vaccines for viruses before they occur in nature."" Toward that end, Crowe and Meiler have organized the Interface Group, a diverse collaboration of scientists across campus, including an expert in game theory who is modeling the interplay between viruses and the immune system. ""You couldn't have this type of biomedical research,"" he said, ""without that playful, curious aesthetic sense that you get with the Rosetta 'community.'""","Published: May 21, 2015"

The closing of the financing is expected to occur within five business days.  HPPI will use this funding to immediately accelerate its development program, which is focused on the treatment of certain cancers using Mayne Pharma's patented oral formulation of the currently approval anti-fungal drug itraconazole, known as SUBA-Itraconazole, for which HPPI has exclusive U.S. rights in the field of cancer.  In particular, HPPI will shortly be commencing a Phase II(b) clinical trial designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of SUBA-Itraconazole dosing on the reduction in individual patient tumor burden in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome (also known as Gorlin Syndrome).  Preliminary results are expected to be available by early 2016. Mayne Pharma's CEO, Mr. Scott Richards said, ""We are excited about increasing our stake in HPPI and accelerating the development and commercialization of our patented SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer.  The body of evidence supporting the use of itraconazole in cancer is well established, and we believe our SUBA-Itraconazole product provides a number of advantages over conventional itraconazole, including improved bioavailability and more consistent blood levels to improve the therapeutic effect.""   Nicholas J. Virca, HPPI's President and CEO, further commented that, ""This investment by Mayne Pharma enables us to immediately begin efforts to open clinical trial sites during this quarter for our Phase II(b) study, following the protocols which were cleared by FDA in December 2014.""   BCCNS results from a genetic mutation, which causes the Hedgehog pathway to function improperly leading to the chronic formation of basal cell tumors. Industry sources estimate that there are approximately 10,000 patients in the United States with BCCNS, which could potentially qualify for SUBA-Itraconazole under the FDA's Orphan Drug Designation Program for treatment of BCCNS in this patient population. ""Our Phase II(b) design is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, non-placebo controlled study which will involve the recruiting of up to 40 patients where a meaningful response will be defined as a 30% or greater reduction in the cumulative size of target tumors, based upon the clinical evaluation of at least 33 of 40 patients. We plan to report preliminary results by early 2016, after assessing the effectiveness and safety of 16 weeks of dosing in these patients,"" commented Mr. Virca.  He continued that, ""If the results demonstrate we have achieved our primary endpoint, we will initiate further discussions with FDA to determine if our trial could potentially serve as the basis for accelerated approval and submission of a New Drug Application."" In the financing, for its $2.5 million investment, Mayne Pharma will receive 33,333,333 shares of HPPI common stock, bringing its position in HPPI to 49.5% of the currently outstanding common stock, and a 5-year warrant to purchase an additional 33,333,333 shares of HPPI common stock.  HPPI, Mayne Pharma and certain related parties have also entered into updated agreements covering HPPI and Mayne Pharma's joint development of SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer as well as certain governance matters relating to HPPI given Mayne Pharma's increased ownership in the company.","Published: May 21, 2015"

ETG is a novel therapeutic category pioneered by Xeltis in which surgeons use synthetic bioabsorbable implants designed to allow the body to repair itself by growing natural, healthy tissue from the inside, leaving nothing behind as the implant is absorbed. In this study, five children born with only one heart ventricle, instead of two healthy, functioning ventricles that pump blood throughout the body, were implanted with Xeltis  vascular graft and were followed up for 12 months. The study was led by renowned cardiac surgeon Prof. Leo Bockeria at the Bakoulev Center for Cardiovascular Surgery of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow.  The results of this study are remarkable. At 12 months follow-up all clinical parameters are positive and all indicators show that patients have successfully grown their own blood vessels , Prof. Leo Bockeria states.  This first feasibility study provides hope that we will soon be able to offer one-time, definitive treatments for pediatric patients born with congenital malformations, who currently must undergo multiple critical surgeries as they age and often need medication throughout their lifetimes, as well as for several other types of applications in the cardiovascular field.  Laurent Grandidier, CEO at Xeltis, adds  The successful completion of our first clinical trial marks the advent of a paradigm shift in cardiovascular treatments. We believe it will be possible one day to replace most commonly used implantable cardiovascular devices by Xeltis  technology. This will enable significantly improved patient outcomes and lower costs of healthcare. This successful clinical trial is a first, remarkable, step in that direction.  ETG and Xeltis  proprietary technologyUnder current standards of care, surgeons or cardiologists implant permanent prostheses made of plastics or parts of animal bodies to repair damaged or malformed hearts and vessels. Because of the limitations of these materials and their long-term presence in the body, the current techniques have limited efficacy, are plagued with complications and often require long-term medication. On the other hand, Xeltis  matrices have the properties to be bioabsorbed over time as new valves and vessels grow, hence leaving no foreign material behind. Because the tissue produced through ETG is the patient s own, the treatment has the potential to stretch the boundaries of current standards of care.","Published: May 21, 2015"

The study was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Science.ALS and FTD in a mouse   Scientists created a mouse model of ALS and FTD caused by mutations in the C9ORF72 gene. Courtesy of Petrucelli lab, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida More than 30,000 Americans live with ALS, which destroys nerves that control essential movements, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. After Alzheimer s disease, FTD is the most common form of early onset dementia. It is characterized by changes in personality, behavior and language due to loss of neurons in the brain s frontal and temporal lobes. Patients with mutations in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene have all or some symptoms associated with both disorders.  Our mouse model exhibits the pathologies and symptoms of ALS and FTD seen in patients with theC9ORF72 mutation,  said the study s lead author, Leonard Petrucelli, Ph.D., chair and Ralph and Ruth Abrams Professor of the Department of Neuroscience at Mayo Clinic, and a senior author of the study.  These mice could greatly improve our understanding of ALS and FTD and hasten the development of effective treatments.  To create the model, Ms. Jeannie Chew, a Mayo Graduate School student and member of Dr. Petrucelli s team, injected the brains of newborn mice with a disease-causing version of the C9ORF72 gene. As the mice aged, they became hyperactive, anxious, and antisocial, in addition to having problems with movement that mirrored patient symptoms. The brains of the mice were smaller than normal and had fewer neurons in areas that controlled the affected behaviors. The scientists also found that the mouse brains had key hallmarks of the disorders, including toxic clusters of ribonucleic acids (RNA) and TDP-43, a protein that has long been known to go awry in the majority of ALS and FTD cases.  This is a significant advancement for the field. Scientists have been trying to create mice that accurately mimic the pathologies associated with these forms of ALS and FTD,  said Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D., program director, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of NIH.  This mouse model will be a valuable tool for developing therapies for these devastating disorders.  The C9ORF72 gene is encoded by repeating strings of six DNA molecules. Disease-causing C9ORF72mutations make the strings excessively long which leads to the accumulation of RNA that either cluster into structures, called foci, or cause the production of abnormal c9RAN proteins in the brain and spinal cord of patients. The scientists found both in the brains of the mice. They also found clumps, or inclusions, of TDP-43 protein which is another pathological hallmark found in patients with the C9ORF72 mutation.  Finding TDP-43 in these mice was unexpected  Dr. Petrucelli said.  We don t yet know how foci and c9RAN proteins are linked to TDP-43 abnormalities, but with our new animal model, we now have a way to find out.  Dr. Petrucelli and his team think these results are an important step in the development of therapies for these forms of ALS and FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

The new study published May 19 in The Journal Neuroscience illustrates that it is the way the brain responds to food cues when individuals are not hungry that predicts weight gain and that the reasons why people gain weight can be fundamentally different.  What this study shows is that different neural circuits confer susceptibility for weight gain depending upon an individual s genotype,  said Dana Small, professor of psychiatry and psychology, deputy director of The John B Pierce Laboratory, and senior author of the study.  The implication is that we might start thinking about taking more of an individual approach for the prevention and treatment of obesity.  When subjects are hungry, the hypothalamus, the master homeostatic regulator that initiates eating, sends signals to amygdala, part of the brain crucial in processing stimuli. But this network reversed when subjects were fed a meal before sipping the milkshake, researchers found. When fully fed, the amygdala signaled the hypothalamus. This was true in all subjects, but researchers found the strength of the amygdala response predicted whether the subjects would gain weight - but only for the two-thirds of the subjects who possessed a genotype associated with high numbers of receptors for dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in responses to reward. And this prediction held only for fully-fed subjects. Small said that about one-third of the population possesses a second genetic variant associated with fewer dopamine receptors. In these individuals it is response in the dorsal striatum, a region critical for forming habits, that predicts weight gain. People with this genotype are also more prone to addiction and impulsive behavior, she said.","Published: May 21, 2015"

This nanosponge-hydrogel minimized the growth of skin lesions on mice infected with MRSA - without the use of antibiotics. The researchers recently published their findings online in Advanced Materials. To make the nanosponge-hydrogel, the team mixed nanosponges, which are nanoparticles that absorb dangerous toxins produced by MRSA, E. coli and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria, into a hydrogel, which is a gel made of water and polymers. The hydrogel holds the nanosponges in place so that they can remove toxins at the infected spot.  We combined the strengths of two different materials - nanosponges and hydrogels - to create a powerful formulation to treat local bacterial infections,  said Liangfang Zhang, nanoengineering professor in the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego, who led the team.  Nanosponges alone are difficult to use on local tissues because they diffuse away to other parts of the body very quickly. By integrating the nanosponges into a hydrogel, we can retain them at the site of infection.  Since the nanosponge-hydrogel treatment does not involve antibiotics, the researchers say that it will not likely be affected by existing bacterial antibiotic resistance. Also, because antibiotics are not involved, the treatment will likely not cause bacteria to develop new resistance. This work is a follow-up to a study that the team presented in Nature Nanotechnology in 2013. The previous study showed that nanosponges absorbed harmful bacterial toxins in the bloodstream and drew them away from their real targets: red blood cells. In this new study, the team reports that removing bacterial toxins could potentially lead to clearing up antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.  One way to treat these infections is to remove the toxins, which act as a weapon and a defense shield for the bacteria that produce them,  said Zhang.  We hypothesize that without the toxins, the bacteria become significantly weakened and exposed, allowing the body s immune system to kill them more easily without the use of drugs.  Nanosponge-hydrogel treatment How does the nanosponge-hydrogel treatment work? Each nanosponge is a nanoparticle coated in a red blood cell membrane. This coating disguises the nanosponges as red blood cells, which are the real targets of the harmful toxins produced by MRSA. By masquerading as red blood cells, the nanosponges attract harmful toxins and remove them from the bloodstream. In order for the nanosponges to remove toxins from a specific spot, such as an infected skin wound, a lot of them need to be held at that spot. This is where the hydrogel plays a role; it can hold billions of nanosponges per milliliter in one spot. The hydrogel s pores are also small enough to keep most of the nanosponges from escaping, but big enough so that toxins can easily get inside and attach to the nanosponges. The researchers showed that the nanosponge-hydrogel treatment kept down the size of skin lesions caused by MRSA infections. In mice, the skin lesions that were treated with the nanosponge-hydrogel were significantly smaller than those that were left untreated.  After injecting the nanosponge-hydrogel at the infected spot, we observed that it absorbed the toxins secreted by the bacteria and prevented further damage to the local blood, skin and muscle tissues,  said Zhang. The team also showed that the hydrogel was effective at holding the nanosponges in place within the body. Two days after the nanosponge-hydrogel was injected underneath the skin of a mouse, nearly 80 percent of the nanosponges were still found at the injection site. When nanosponges were injected without the hydrogel, only 20 percent of them remained at the injection site after two hours. Most of them diffused to the surrounding tissues.","Published: May 21, 2015"

For decades, the fly has been used as a model organism in genetic research; its genome was fully sequenced in 2000. However, until now researchers have failed to identify the specific pheromone in this species that leads to mating success. Although the pheromones that inhibit mating in Drosophila were known, the positive pheromone signal that elicits courtship behavior and mating remained a mystery. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, have succeeded in identifying a relatively simple molecule that is able to regulate complex mating behavior in vinegar flies: a fatty acid methyl ester called methyl laurate. Verification was a result of the combination of state-of-the-art chemical analytic techniques, physiological measurements in the fly brain, and behavioral assays. Pheromones are signal molecules that pass information from individuals of one species to their conspecifics. In addition to aggregation pheromones, which prompt insects of the same species to come together, or alarm pheromones, which warn conspecifics about imminent danger, sex pheromones are quite well-known. Female insects emit sex pheromones in order to attract potential mating partners. The sexual attractant used by female silkworm moths, bombykol, was the first pheromone to be identified and its effect on males proven (this occurred in the late 1950s). Since then various sex pheromones in other insect species have been identified. Pheromones have also been used successfully for pest control purposes: the female attractant is employed as bait to lure males into pheromone traps. Yet the female sex pheromone   the signal molecule which attracts males and triggers mating behavior   of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster remained until recently unidentified.  Hany Dweck, Markus Knaden, Bill Hansson and their colleagues in the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology started their research by making a mistake: They had assumed that the odor of virgin females was especially attractive to males and were therefore looking for odors that are exclusively found in unmated females. However, these studies did not in the end help identify the substance that would trigger mating behavior. Physiological and genetic data indicated that the flies must have a neuron type that responds to a specific, yet unidentified, compound within odor collections from flies. When this neuron type, which expresses the specific olfactory receptor Or47b, was missing, mating behavior in males was inhibited.  Therefore Hany Dweck started to collect odors from thousands of vinegar flies, not only from virgin females but also from mated females and even males. In order to analyze single odor components, he used the new technique of Thermal Desorption GC-MS. This combination of gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) also uses the advantages of thermal desorption, which help to measure and identify even the tiniest amounts of volatile substances. Hany Dweck then performed electrophysiological measurements to test all identified compounds with respect to their ability to activate the pheromone-specific neuron. From all tested volatile compounds vinegar flies emit, only one substance triggered a strong response in this neuron: methyl laurate, a substance which analyses revealed to have a relatively plain molecule structure.  From our perspective as chemists, we were almost disappointed that a molecule which conveys something important as sex has such a simple structure,  says Ale  Svato , who performed the chemical analyses to identify the pheromone. Methyl laurate occurs not only in virgin females but also in mated females and even male flies. The compound is detected by a neuron which expresses the olfactory receptor Or47b; this receptor responds exclusively to methyl laurate.In males, methyl laurate triggers courtship behavior. The odor of virgin females is most attractive to males, because during mating males transfer the male-specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate to females, making these mated females unattractive to other males. Methyl laurate is also detected by another sensory neuron type that expresses the olfactory receptor Or88a. Flies which lack the olfactory receptor Or47b are still attracted by the odor of other flies; however, their mating behavior is considerably reduced. Flies which lack the olfactory receptor Or88a are no longer attracted to fly-specific odors; however, their mating behavior is uninhibited.  The novel pheromone activates two different circuits: one is involved in courtship and mating of males and females, the other one in aggregation,  Markus Knaden, who led the studies, explains. Interestingly, the scientists were able to show the presence of methyl laurate in all tested Drosophila species. Furthermore, the same pheromone-specific neuron types which activate the olfactory receptors Or47b or Or88a respond to methyl laurate. Methyl laurate transmits a positive mating signal that seems to be conserved within many drosophilid flies. In order to circumvent hybridization, each species seems to carry species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons that inhibit mating. The close collaboration of scientists from different disciplines was the secret of this successful basic research project.  Our study would not have been possible without this interdisciplinary approach. It is great that we can combine the results of different techniques, chemical analytics, electrophysiological measurements, imaging methods and last but not least behavioral assays. We can team up and make such a comprehensive and exciting story out of it,  says Bill Hansson, director of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology.   In further experiments, the scientists want take a closer look at the compound methyl laurate. They are particularly interested in knowing whether the fly produces the substance itself or whether symbiotic bacteria may be involved in its production. Max Planck Institute   press release Hany K.

The researchers have identified a molecule called MCAM, and they have shown that blocking this molecule could delay the onset of the disease and significantly slow its progression. These encouraging results from in vitro tests in humans and in vivo tests in mice are published online today in the Annals of Neurology. ""We believe we have identified the first therapy that will impact the quality of life of people with multiple sclerosis by significantly reducing the disability and the disease's progression,"" said Dr. Alexandre Prat, lead author of the study, researcher at the CRCHUM, and professor in the Department of Neurosciences at the University of Montreal. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by paralysis, numbness, loss of vision, and gait and balance deficits that lead to chronic disability. There is no effective cure. The disease particularly affects young adults in northern countries. In Canada, nearly 75,000 people have MS. The brain is normally protected from attacks by the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier prevents immune cells   lymphocytes   from entering the central nervous system. In people with MS, there is often leakage. Two types of lymphocytes, CD4 and CD8, find a way to cross this protective barrier. They attack the brain by destroying the myelin sheath that protects neurons, resulting in decreased transmission of nerve impulses, and plaque formation. In 2008, Dr. Prat's team identified a cell adhesion molecule, called MCAM (Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule), which plays a crucial role in dysregulation of the immune system observed in multiple sclerosis. ""Our studies have shown that MCAM is necessary for the migration of CD4 and CD8 across the blood-brain barrier. If we block the interaction of MCAM with the protein to which it normally binds, we decrease the disease's activity,"" he said. Independently, the biotechnology company Prothena Corporation plc also discovered complementary data regarding MCAM, which led to an ongoing collaboration between the CRCHUM and Prothena. The results are extremely positive. ""We observed a decrease of approximately 50% of the disease in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most widely used animal model of MS. What is especially significant is that we can stop the disease from the first symptoms in addition to having an impact on its progression, which is a first,"" noted Prat. MS develops in most patients in two phases. For 10 to 15 years, there are outbreaks of symptoms interspersed with remissions. Later, the diseases progresses and the disability worsens, leading to the use of a cane or wheelchair. Currently, none of the drugs available on the market affect the disease's progression. Prothena has developed a potentially disease-modifying antibody, called PRX003, which is designed, to inhibit MCAM function and thus prevent migration of destructive lymphocytes into tissue.

This points to a potential target for developing new therapies to treat multiple sclerosis and could have important implications for other autoimmune diseases, such as the colon disease colitis and the chronic skin condition atopic dermatitis. Further, the work has produced new research models of MS symptoms such as movement disorders and balance control problems that have, until now, resisted efforts to mimic them effectively in the lab. These models represent important new tools in the efforts to better understand - and eventually cure - MS and other autoimmune conditions. The researchers determined that a mutation in the gene Nlrp12 was causing immune cells known as T cells to go haywire. Normally, the researchers determined, the protein the gene produces acts as a brake within T cells to control the inflammatory response. But a mutation in that gene disrupts the natural process and provokes severe inflammation - with effects the researchers found most intriguing. To the researchers' surprise, the resulting inflammation did not produce the paralysis often associated with multiple sclerosis. It did, however, produce other MS symptoms -- such as movement disorders and problems with balance control -- which scientists have struggled to replicate in experimental lab settings. ""It's important to note that MS is a spectrum disorder - some patients present with paralyzing conditions and some patients don't,"" said researcher John Lukens, PhD, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine Department of Neuroscience and its Center for Brain Immunology and Glia. ""Not everybody's symptoms are the same, so this might give us a glimpse into the etiology or pathogenesis of that family of MS."" By blocking the inflammatory response, doctors may one day be able to control the symptoms it causes, both in MS and in other diseases driven by hyperinflammation.

The researchers have thus succeeded in capturing spectacular microscopic images, such as in the nervous system of a zebrafish larva, a preferred model organism for research. Motor neurons in the spinal cord can be seen in the researchers  images; at the same time, a single neuron with all its extensions is highlighted in another color. An observation by William Dempsey, post-doc in the group of ETH professor Periklis Pantazis, led to the new application. He worked with a special class of fluorescent proteins that change color when irradiated with laser light of a specific wavelength. One such  chameleon protein  is called Dendra 2, which normally emits green light when illuminated with blue light. The emission of Dendra 2 is however shifted into the red when it is irradiated by intensive violet or ultraviolet (UV) laser light. Dempsey and Pantazis specifically discovered that when Dendra 2 is irradiated by both a blue and a red laser at the same time, the protein s color can also change to red. For this dual-color illumination low intensity laser light is sufficient. In contrast to high intensity violet or UV irradiation it does not damage living cells. ETH professor Pantazis and his colleagues then had an idea of how this finding could be deployed in light microscopy. Fluorescent proteins can be used to make whole cells, precise cell structures or single molecules visible. For the first time, the ETH researcher s discovery permits a single cell or group of molecules located within a desirable part of a living organism to be highlighted with one color, while all the other cells or molecules remain visible with another color. The research group showed that when used individually, two different laser beams cannot change a chameleon protein s color. But when the two beams are combined and directed in a way that they meet at a certain point on the object, then the proteins in focus change color. In contrast, the proteins that are not activated at the same time by the two lasers retain their original color. The researchers have developed a simple and inexpensive color filter, which can be used with the conventional confocal laser microscopes that are found in many biomedical research institutes. When mounted between the laser source and object, the filter divides the laser light into separate blue and red beams that are directed on to a small focal point on the object. In the case of the zebrafish larva, which is transparent and therefore well suited for microscopy, the ETH researchers used Dendra 2 to color neurons. They then focused the combined laser beam s focal point on the cell body of a single neuron in a live, anesthetized zebrafish. The local Dendra 2 molecules became red, spread throughout the entire cell and dyed the cell extensions. All other cells, even in the immediate vicinity of the targeted cell, remained green. The ability to make individual neurons visible could be of great importance, for example, in the precise mapping of the brain, according to Pantazis. Since the method is suitable for individual cell targeting in living organisms, it could also be used to examine dynamic processes; for example, what happens to individual cells or a group of molecules when researchers treat an organism with active pharmaceutical ingredients. Embryo development could also be examined in more detail.  Our method allows for a three-dimensional analysis in an elegant manner,  explains Pantazis.  This is a very nice example of how you can take a result from basic research and use it to provide a solution for a technically challenging issue.  Pantazis hopes the technique will be used more broadly in biomedical research in the future and is in talks with microscope manufacturers to implement this technology.

University of Queensland researcher Dr Beben Benyamin from the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) collaborated with researchers at VU University of Amsterdam to review almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years, involving more than 14.5 million twin pairs. The findings, published in Nature Genetics, reveal on average the variation for human traits and diseases is 49 per cent genetic, and 51 per cent due to environmental factors and/or measurement errors.  There has still been conjecture over how much variation is caused by genetics and how much is caused by environmental factors -- what people call nature versus nurture,  Dr Benyamin said.  We wanted to resolve that by revisiting almost all the genetic twin studies conducted over the past 50 years, and comparing all of them together,  he said. Although the contribution of genetic and environmental factors was balanced for most of the traits studied, the research showed there could be significant differences in individual traits. For example, risk for bipolar disorder was about 70 per cent due to genetics and 30 per cent due to environmental factors.  When visiting the nature versus nurture debate, there is overwhelming evidence that both genetic and environmental factors can influence traits and diseases,  Dr Benyamin said.  What is comforting is that, on average, about 50 per cent of individual differences are genetic and 50 per cent are environmental.  The findings show that we need to look at ourselves outside of a view of nature versus nurture, and instead look at it as nature and nurture.  In 69 per cent of cases, the study also revealed that individual traits were the product of the cumulative effect of genetic differences.  This means that there are good reasons to study the biology of human traits, and that the combined effect of many genes on a trait is simply the sum of the effect of each individual gene,  Dr Benyamin said.  This finding has implications for choosing the best strategy to find genes affecting disease.  Professor Peter Visscher from QBI said the study was performed using publications from the classical twin design, which compares the similarities of identical twins who share all their genes, to those of non-identical twins who share half their genes.  Twin studies have been the main method for researching the genetic and environmental sources of variation between humans for a long time because of the availability of the two types of twins,  Professor Visscher said. The study involved a meta-analysis of 17,804 traits from 2748 publications between 1958 and 2012, based on data from 14,558,903 twin pairs. The University of Queensland   press release Tinca J.C.

Medicago said the new 473,612-square-foot facility will be located on a 968,752-square-foot site within Quebec City's Espace d'innovation D'Estimauville. The company produces vaccines and therapeutic proteins based on its own Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) and manufacturing technologies. The new facility will give Medicago the capacity to deliver up to 40 to 50 million doses of quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccines, as well as work towards developing new products. Medicago's technology uses plants to quickly produce large quantities of vaccines or treatments. The technology enabled production of candidate vaccines for H1N1 in 2009, and H7N9 in 2013, in just 19 days, compared to the several months required to produce vaccines using eggs. Medicago recently won a U.S. government contract to manufacture Ebola antibodies in its Quebec City pilot production plant for a study in non-human primates. The technology can quickly produce large amounts of antibodies, thereby boosting production volumes to increase stockpiles across the globe, according to the company.  We will export most of our vaccines to foreign markets, but we also believe our new production complex will help Canada meet its needs for seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines, in addition to strengthening the country's response to emerging diseases around the world,  Medicago CEO Andy Sheldon said in a statement. The complex will also enable Medicago to regroup its head office, R&D activities, and commercial production plant. Medicago said it chose to locate the complex in Quebec City because of the availability of qualified employees, a world-class research infrastructure, dynamic business culture and support from the federal, provincial, and municipal governments. The support from all three levels of government took the form of loans or discounted land purchase costs. The governments of Canada and Quebec provided loans of C$8 million ($6.5 million) and C$60 million ($49 million), respectively. The municipal government contributed support valued at C$6.5 million ($3.7 million).

Then, faced with backed up toilets and stinking grids we remember that our waste water and faecal matter has to go somewhere, the sewers. Taken for granted, many city sewers are based on systems and pipes designed and constructed in the Victorian era when the population was significantly smaller. Nowadays our sewers have to cope with more than human waste. Fat and other household items are a major source of sewer blockages, with massive fatbergs making the news as they cause drains and toilets to back-up and overflow. To clear and clean our sewers means sending men and machines underground. A team in Australia have recently developed a method to measure the concentrations of sulphur compounds in the sewer s air   and since sulphurous compounds cause the most noxious smells in the sewers this research could bring a breath of fresh air to sewer workers everywhere. Many of the smells we know can be traced back to sulphur and its compounds. Examples include hydrogen sulphide smelling like bad eggs and thiols (organic compounds with an  R-SH group in the molecule) added to natural gas so we can detect gas leaks by smell. Many of the smells in sewer systems come from sulphur compounds   so the researchers at the University of NSW, Australia have developed a method to detect and quantify these compounds.  One of the challenges faced by the researchers was in the sampling and preservation of the samples   something that all chromatographers need to be aware of. Previous research by the team had identified sample containers that were inert to the volatiles likely to be found in sewer gases. The team took regular samples and stored the samples in an environmental chamber to minimise volatile losses through the sample bags before analysis. The analysis of the samples was carried out using gas chromatography (GC), but first the samples were thermally desorbed.  Thermal desorption (TD) is a standard analytical technique used in chromatography to allow GC to be used with low concentration analytes. A comparison of TD with other techniques used in trace VOC analysis is discussed in this recent article from Chromatography Today  Trace Level VOC Analysis in Different Sample Matrices . The team developed the method using a sulphur chemiluminescence detector (GC-SCD) which detected a wide range of volatile sulphur compounds. The new method increases the number of compounds that can be tested in sewer air   and with good sensitivity and specificity means that the detection of sulphur compounds in foodstuffs, oil products and wine will also benefit. So next time you flush   TD-GC-SCD could be quantifying your waste.","Published: May 20, 2015"

Alison Olcott Marshall and Craig Marshall propose that a combination of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy with Raman spectroscopy is one of the best methods for finding signs of extraterrestrials on the red planet. This new technique is aimed at discovering ancient alien life on Mars by providing a viable screening test to aid the process of recognizing condensed aromatic carbon which is a chemical signature of astrobiology. Alison Olcott Marshall and Craig Marshall have published a paper that points to the disadvantage of using merely Raman spectroscopy, in the Philosophical Transaction of the Royal Society. Raman spectroscopy can only identify inorganic and organic materials. Hence, it needs to be supported by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy in order to establish definitive evidence of Martian life. NASA and ESA have already found proof of water having flowed on the red planet s surface. In fact, just this year, data collected by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station and the Curiosity rover claimed that water in its liquid form may be present to this day. The University of Kansas researchers are continuing to test the gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy technique by analyzing rocks on Earth which could be similar to those on Mars. They have identified areas on the Kansas-Oklahoma border with chemical content which appears promising. Previously, experiments on the viability of using Raman spectroscopy on our neighbouring planet were mostly carried out on pure salts and minerals synthesized in laboratories. Needless to say, if the new technique by Alison Olcott Marshall and Craig Marshall is proven useful, scientists will be able to hunt for alien life on Mars much more efficiently.","Published: May 20, 2015"

With enhancers and other regulatory elements often lying 10s to 100s of kilobases from the genes they affect, understanding the regulation of gene expression is an incredibly complex endeavor. Dr Hughes and his collaborators have developed a versatile and scalable solution to enrich for enhancer:promoter interactions by integrating oligo capture and NGS technology into the 3C workflow.

A team led by Chengdu's Zhihe Zhang examined the fecal microbiomes of 45 captive pandas, representing adults, juveniles, and cubs, over the course of a year, and compared them to those from other animals, including herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores. The giant panda microbiome typically exhibited low microbial diversity and was more similar to that of omnivorous or carnivorous bears. Further, it also typically lacked known cellulose-degrading bacteria. ""This result is unexpected and quite interesting because it implies the giant panda's gut microbiota may not have well adapted to its unique diet and places pandas at an evolutionary dilemma,"" coauthor Xiaoyan Pang, an associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said in a statement. Giant pandas evolved from omnivorous bears, and their ancestors began to exclusively eat bamboo between 2 million and 2.4 million years ago. This switch was likely in conjunction with a number of genomic mutations, including the loss of the umami taste receptor gene. While the researchers noted that the giant panda has morphological features like strong jaws, teeth, and an enlarged radial sesamoid that help it eat bamboo, the giant panda has retained a simple stomach, unlike the elongated ones common to herbivores that increase gut retention time and digestion of plant polysaccharides. Instead, the microbial residents of the panda gut have been thought to enable the breakdown of the plant matter. Zhang, Pang, and their colleagues collected 121 samples of giant panda feces from 24 adults, 16 juveniles, and five unweaned cubs   all captive   during three different seasons of one year. Through barcoded pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, they generated more than 97,000 reads, which, after filtering, were grouped into 781 operational taxonomic units. The vast majority of bacteria in the samples belonged to nine phyla and 109 genera, the researchers found, with the most prominent phyla being Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and the most prominent genus being Escherichia/Shigella. However, the amount of these bacteria present in the samples varied wildly: the researchers noted that Escherichia/Shigella was the only genus they uncovered in all adult, juvenile, and cub microbiomes, but its abundance ranged from 0.6 percent to 97.1 percent. The alpha diversity of the adult and juvenile samples was similar to each other, but varied across the seasons. Seven of the 10 dominant genera, the researchers found, fluctuated over the course of the year. For instance, Klebsiella was enriched during the summer, but not in the spring or late autumn, while Streptococcus and Clostridium were more abundant during the late autumn. There was also a dramatic shift in intra-individual variation between spring and summer to late fall. For each individual, the researchers noted the gut microbiota structure became increasingly dissimilar over time. This change in diversity, they noted, appeared to be linked to what part of the bamboo plant was available to dine on. The cubs, meanwhile, harbored microbiomes in which Lactobacillus numbers exceeded Escherichia/Shigella numbers. To see how these giant panda microbiomes compared to those of other mammals, the researchers combined their dataset with a previously gathered 16S rRNA gene clone library that included eight captive giant pandas and seven wild giant pandas along with 128 other animals, representing nearly 60 species and a dozen orders. As compared to the other herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores, the giant panda's microbiome had significantly lower alpha diversity. A diverse microbiome, the researchers noted, is typically thought to be beneficial. The giant panda microbiome was fully differentiated, the researchers added, from non-panda herbivores, but clustered near those of red panda, bears, and a few other carnivores. They added that this indicated that giant pandas have a microbiome composition that's distinct from other herbivores. By comparing the giant panda microbiome to another 16S rRNA dataset composed of fecal samples from Asian black bears, Siberian tigers, chimpanzees, golden snub-nosed monkeys, hoolock gibbons, and blue peafowl, the researchers found that the giant panda microbiome shared some similarities with the omnivorous bear and carnivorous tiger samples. Notably, it lacked bacteria that are present in many herbivores and are involved in cellulose digestion and utilization. While a few panda fecal samples contained bacteria that could be related to cellulose-digesting strains, none of these putatively cellulolytic lineages were shared by a majority of pandas. The giant panda microbiome, then, likely doesn't aid in bamboo digestion, the researchers said. They also speculated that this might put the panda at a higher risk of extinction. ""Unlike other mammalian species that have evolved gut microbiota (and also digestive system anatomies) optimized for their specific diets, the aberrant coevolution of the giant panda, its dietary preferences, and its gut microbiota remains enigmatic,"" the researchers concluded.","Published: May 20, 2015"

This type of self-assembly is seen in nature, such as in gecko feet and the salvinia leaf, and scientists have been trying to mimic these multi-functional structures for decades. The researchers have found they can control capillary force the tendency of a liquid to rise in narrow tubes or be drawn into small openings by changing the surface structure of a material. ""Using laser printing techniques we can control the size, geometry, elasticity and distance between tiny pillars narrower than the width of a human hair to get the self-assembly that we want,"" Swinburne's Dr. Yanlei Hu, said. He is the lead author of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Ultrafast laser printing produces an array of vertical nanorods of varying heights. After the laser process, the material is washed in a development solvent using a method similar to traditional darkroom film processing. The gravity-governed capillary force difference creates pillars of unequal physical properties along different axes. ""A possible application of these structures is in on-chip micro-object trap-release systems which are in demand in chemical analysis and biomedical devices,"" co-author Dr Ben Cumming said. The researchers demonstrated the ability of the LPCS structures to selectively capture and release microparticles. ""This hybrid strategy for preparing hierarchical structures features simplicity, scalability and high flexibility in comparison to other state-of the-art approaches such as photolithography, electron-beam lithography and template replicating,"" Director of the Centre for Micro-Photonics at Swinburne, Prof. Min Gu, said. ""Moreover, the assembled cells can be used as automatic micro-grippers for selective trapping and controllable releasing, suggesting many potential applications in the field of chemistry, biomedicine and microfluidic engineering.""","Published: May 20, 2015"

However, such devices are often susceptible to attack by the immune system, which can render them useless. A team of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers has come up with a way to reduce that immune-system rejection. In a study appearing in Nature Materials, they found that the geometry of implantable devices has a significant impact on how well the body will tolerate them. Although the researchers expected that smaller devices might be better able to evade the immune system, they discovered that larger spherical devices are actually better able to maintain their function and avoid scar-tissue buildup.  We were surprised by how much the size and shape of an implant can affect its triggering of an immune response. What it s made of is still an important piece of the puzzle, but it turns out if you really want to have the least amount of scar tissue you need to pick the right size and shape,  says Daniel Anderson, the Samuel A. Goldblith Associate Professor in MIT s Dept. of Chemical Engineering, a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and the paper s senior author. The researchers hope to use this insight to further develop an implantable device that could mimic the function of the pancreas, potentially offering a long-term treatment for diabetes patients. It could also be applicable to devices used to treat many other diseases.  I believe the understanding achieved here will help scientists not only move forward on creating better implants to someday treat diabetes, but will also aid in the design of any type of human or animal implant to treat or diagnose disease,  says study author Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, IMES, and the Dept. of Chemical Engineering. This study grew out of the researchers  efforts to build an artificial pancreas, which began several years ago. The goal is to deliver pancreatic islet cells encapsulated within a particle made of alginate a polysaccharide naturally found in algae or another material. These implanted cells could replace patients  pancreatic islet cells, which are nonfunctional in Type I diabetes. Just like normal islet cells, these cells would sense sugar levels in the blood and secrete the appropriate amount of insulin to absorb the sugar, eliminating the need for insulin injections. However, if scar tissue surrounds the implanted cells, they can t do their job.  The purpose of these implantable devices is to protect the cells from the immune system, but allow them to stay alive and continue to function,  Anderson says. The researchers tested spheres in two sizes 0.5 and 1.5 mm in diameter. In tests of diabetic mice, the spheres were implanted within the abdominal cavity and the researchers tracked their ability to accurately respond to changes in glucose levels. The devices prepared with the smaller spheres were completely surrounded by scar tissue and failed after about a month, while the larger ones were not rejected and continued to function for more than six months. The larger spheres also evaded the immune response in tests in nonhuman primates. Smaller spheres implanted under the skin were engulfed by scar tissue after only two weeks, while the larger ones remained clear for up to four weeks.  We observed over an order of magnitude fewer immune cells on all surfaces of larger diameter spheres,  Doloff says.  When we first got this data it was counterintuitive,  Anderson says.  There was reason to think when you have these little small beads they would elicit less of a response, but it just wasn't the case.  This effect was seen not only with alginate, but also with spheres made of stainless steel, glass, polystyrene, and polycaprolactone, a type of polyester.  We realized that regardless of what the composition of the material is, this effect still persists, and that made it a lot more exciting because it s a lot more generalizable,  Veiseh says. The researchers believe this finding could be applicable to any other type of implantable device, including drug-delivery vehicles and sensors for glucose and insulin, which could also help improve diabetes treatment. Optimizing particle size and shape could also help guide scientists in developing other types of implantable cells for treating diseases other than diabetes.  For any of these devices that people want to make, it may be important to think carefully about the size and shape of them,  Anderson says.","Published: May 20, 2015"

Crucially, stopping the clock allows the cells to become active and inflamed.   The complex mechanism involves a factor called miR155, which destroys a key cog in the clock s mechanism called BMAL1. This allows the macrophage to make a number of inflammatory proteins that effectively wake up and activate the immune system. Explaining the mechanism, Senior Research Fellow in the School of Biochemistry and Immunology at Trinity, Dr Annie Curtis, who is a lead author of the paper, said:  It s as if an infection causes the alarm in a macrophage clock to go off.  Scientists have known for a long time that the immune system and body clock are interconnected, and that our immune system responds differently to bacteria depending on the time of day at which it is exposed. For example, in mice and humans, the immune response tends to be greater at the beginning of the night compared to the early morning. The researchers found that this was dependent on the level of clock protein (BMAL1) present in the macrophage. BMAL1 functions as a  dampener  of the immune system and, because levels are lower at night, the immune system can be more active.  Why this is the case is not fully clear, but a less active immune system during the day (when BMAL1 levels are higher) might mean that our bodies don t over-react to infections, which are more likely to occur when we are active and meeting sources of infection. However, if our systems need to mount a big response - such as when we are infected with a virus or bacteria - then macrophages can reduce BMAL1 levels, and they do this via miR-155.   This was a big piece of the puzzle   we knew that uncovering what causes the reduction in BMAL1 within activated macrophages would be important to link the immune and clock system together,  said Professor of Biochemistry at Trinity, Luke O Neill, who is joint-senior author on the study. The researchers also showed that miR-155 induction is greater in the evening than in the morning, providing rationale as to why our immune response is more active at the transition into night.  There may be times such as during an acute infection where it's advantageous for the immune system to use miR-155 to stop the macrophage clock and allow the body to clear the infection,  said Professor Garret FitzGerald, from the University of Pennsylvania, who is a joint-senior author. However, he added:  When inflammation is present for long periods of time, as is the case for patients with a chronic disease like rheumatoid arthritis, this constant targeting of the clock may actually worsen disease.  Taken together this study underlines the important role of the body clock in our immune response and provides a rationale for treating immune disorders at certain times of the day and using therapies that restore the clock as anti-inflammatory agents.  It may even help us target cancers by adjusting the time we administer cancer immunotherapies  to coincide with this daily rise and fall in the activity of our immune systems,  added Dr Curtis. This work was supported by grants from the European Research Council, Science Foundation Ireland and the National Institutes of Health.","Published: May 20, 2015"

In a recent research study published in Nature Communications neurobiologist Sara Wilson, Ume  University, found that during embryonic development different parts of the nerve cell are important for guiding other nerve cells into their physical positions. ""We found nerve cells do this in two ways, either acting as barriers preventing cell bodies to move further than they need to, or by acting as guides opening a corridor that the cell bodies can travel along,"" she says. The nervous system is analogous to a biological ""computer"" with different nerve cells forming connections that continuously send neural information around the spinal cord, brain and body and back again. Each nerve cell has a kind of ""GPS coordinate"" and exactly where nerve cells are physically located is very important so they can connect correctly with other nerve cells. When nerve cells are in the wrong place neural information is not transmitted properly and it results in dysfunction and neurodevelopmental disorders such as lissencephaly, Kallmann syndrome and periventricular heterotopia. These misplacements can also happen in very common developmental disorders such as dyslexia and autistic spectrum disorders but it is not fully clear what role such misplacements play in these cases. ""Because nerve cell position is so important in normal nervous system function and dysfunction we wanted to find out how nerve cells position themselves in the first place. This study uncovered an exciting new mechanism for how this happens"" Sara Wilson says. It is important that the two main parts of a nerve cell (the cell body and the axon) are in the right places to get the nervous system to work properly. The axons usually group together and form structures similar to corridors heading in a certain direction. Using genetic changes in mouse embryos to disrupt these axonal corridors (make them head in a different direction), her research group at Ume  Centre of Molecular Medicine, now at the Department of Molecular Biology, Ume  University, found that cell bodies from nerve cells also end up in the wrong place. ""This means the axons from some nerve cells are influencing the position of the cell bodies of other nerve cells meaning that the nerve cells are creating a ""map"" for other nerve cells to find their way"" Sara Wilson says. ""This is the first time that axons have been shown to act as barriers and it could have important implications for understanding how the nervous system forms in all animals, including humans"" Sara Wilson concludes. Overall, this work and other work from the group focuses on understanding the mechanisms (genetic, cellular and molecular) of how the precise ""anatomy"" of the nervous system first forms and how that influences neuronal function and dysfunction. This basic science research has important medical implications for understanding the cause of some neurodevelopmental disorders: For example do the genes that are associated with such disorders generally control cell body guidance and is that what leads to dysfunction? ""It can also give clues as to how to grow axons during regeneration following damage or disease of the nervous system. Can we ""force"" regenerating neurons to connect properly? In the future, we plan to continue this basic research and find medical research teams to collaborate with to see if our findings are beneficial in these medical contexts"" Sara Wilson says.

Anu Sharma, of the Department of Speech Language and Hearing Science at University of Colorado, has applied fundamental principles of neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to forge new connections, to determine the ways it adapts to hearing loss, as well as the consequences of those changes. Her findings are being presented during the 169th meeting of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA), taking place May 18-22, 2015 in Pittsburgh. The work of Sharma's group centers on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of adults and children with deafness and lesser hearing loss, to gain insights into the ways their brains respond differently from those of people with normal hearing. As many as 128 sensors were placed on the scalp, allowing researchers to measure brain activity in response to sound simulation. Sound simulation, such as recorded speech syllables, is delivered via speakers, to elicit a response in the form of ""brain waves"" that originate in the auditory cortex -- the most important center for processing speech and language -- and other areas of the brain. ""We can examine certain biomarkers of cortical functioning, which tell us how the hearing portion of a deaf person's brain is functioning compared to a person with normal hearing,"" Sharma said. Sharma and other researchers have recently discovered that the areas of the brain responsible for processing vision or touch can recruit, or take over, areas in which hearing is normally processed, but which receive little or no stimulation in deafness. This is called ""cross-modal"" cortical reorganization and reflects a fundamental property of the brain to compensate in response to its environment. ""We find that this kind of compensatory adaptation may significantly decrease the brain's available resources for processing sound and can affect a deaf patient's ability to effectively perceive speech with their cochlear implants,"" said Sharma. Cochlear implants are implanted devices that bypass damaged portions of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve. Signals generated by the implant are sent by way of the auditory nerve to the brain, which recognizes the signals as sound, according to the National Institutes of Health. Sharma, with her students Julia Campbell and Garrett Cardon, also recently made the discovery that ""cross-modal recruitment of the hearing portion of the brain by the senses of vision and touch happens not only in deaf patients, but is also clearly apparent in adult patients with only a mild degree of hearing loss."" ""The hearing areas of the brain shrink in age-related hearing loss,"" she continued. ""Centers of the brain that are typically used for higher-level decision-making are then activated in just hearing sounds."" The group's work suggests that the portion of the brain used for hearing can become reorganized, even in earliest stages of age-related hearing loss. And, ""these compensatory changes increase the overall load on the brains of aging adults,"" Sharma said. This finding has important clinical implications for developing early screening programs for hearing loss in adults. ""Compensatory brain reorganization secondary to hearing loss may also be a factor in explaining recent reports in the literature that show age-related hearing loss is significantly correlated with dementia,"" Sharma said. Further, the results suggest that age-related hearing loss must be taken seriously, even in its earliest stages. ""One in three adults over the age of 60 has age-related hearing loss,"" Sharma noted. ""Given that even small degrees of hearing loss can cause secondary changes in the brain, hearing screenings for adults and intervention in the form of hearing aids should be considered much earlier to protect against reorganization of the brain."" Sharma's group has demonstrated that charting brain functioning in patients with cochlear implants is a valuable tool to help predict their outcomes. ""If a deaf child shows cross-modal reorganization -- by vision, for example -- it allows us to determine the optimal rehabilitation strategy for that particular child,"" she said. Next, Sharma and colleagues will continue to explore fundamental aspects of neuroplasticity in deafness that may help improve outcomes for children and adults with hearing loss and deafness. ""Our goal is to develop user-friendly EEG technologies, to allow clinicians to easily 'image' the brains of individual patients with hearing loss to determine whether and to what degree their brains have become reorganized,"" she said.

The number of people with dementia is steadily increasing. Currently there are about 850,000 cases in the UK, with numbers expected to reach over a million by 2021. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. It begins when a protein called beta-amyloid forms senile plaques that start to clump together in the brain, damaging nerve cells and leading to memory loss and confusion. David Allsop, Professor of Neuroscience, and Dr Mark Taylor, from the Faculty of Health and Medicine, have developed a new drug which in laboratory tests reduces the number of these senile plaques and the amount of brain inflammation and oxidative damage associated with Alzheimer's disease. Lancaster University has filed a patent application for the drug, and it will be progressing into clinical trials run by the research company MAC Clinical Research. If it passes regulatory hurdles, the ultimate aim is to give the drug to people with mild symptoms of memory loss. Professor Allsop said: ""It is encouraging that our drug is being taken forward and will be tested on humans. ""Many people who are mildly forgetful may go on to develop the disease because senile plaques start forming years before any symptoms manifest themselves. The ultimate aim is to give the drug at that stage, to stop any more damage to the brain."" Professor Allsop was the first scientist to isolate senile plaques from the human brain. Dr Steve Higham, Chief Operating Officer of MAC Clinical Research said: ""Preventing Alzheimer's disease progression remains a critical unmet need for millions of people worldwide. With that in mind we are very pleased to begin this exciting partnership with Professor David Allsop, his team and Lancaster University."" Dr James Pickett, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Society which currently funds the research, said: ""There's a tremendous need for new treatments that can stop the development of dementia in its tracks. Trials in people are an essential step in the development of any new drug so it's really positive to see this promising research being taken forward.

MS is one of Genzyme s key therapeutic areas of interest, along with rare disease. Two monoclonal antibodies against MS are in the company s pipeline. One is the preclinical compound GZ402668, subject of a Phase I first-in-human, single ascending dose study and a long-term follow-up study. The other is Vatelizumab, indicated for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and subject of the Phase II EMPIRE trial for which Genzyme enrolled its first patients in November. As of April 22, Genzyme was enrolling patients by invitation only, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. Genzyme says its current research efforts on MS  aim to develop agents that could provide neuroprotection against immunological damage and promote remyelination of neurons (neural repair).  Such approaches may have applicability to other inflammatory neurological disorders such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP),  Genzyme adds. Ablynx has already generated Nanobodies against the specific target of interest, and confirmed their activity in pre-clinical models. The neurodegeneration observed in MS is not directly targeted by existing treatments, Genzyme said. Upon completion of studies, Genzyme will have the option to negotiate a license agreement. Genzyme said it seeks to target underlying causes of MS disease progression, as well as develop treatments to protect neurons and promote repair of CNS damage.

As part of the WGS500 study, an international team led by investigators in the UK did clinical genome sequencing on more than 150 cases or families that appeared to be genetic in nature but could not be explained by prior screening tests. The approach led to new diagnoses in just over one-fifth of the cases, including more than one-third of the Mendelian disorders considered. The researchers also found a few dozen alterations that had possible clinical importance but were in genes not related to the condition they were originally attempting to diagnose. ""Our results demonstrate the value of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding challenges,"" corresponding author Gilean McVean, a researcher with the University of Oxford's Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, and colleagues wrote. He and his colleagues considered 156 individuals or families affected by unexplained Mendelian or immunological conditions, sequencing each individual's genome to nearly 32-fold coverage, on average. More than 88 percent of protein-coding sequences were covered to average depths of at least 20-fold or more. The team tracked down pathogenic variants in 33 of the individuals tested   just over 21 percent. The diagnostic yield was somewhat higher within the Mendelian cases, where genome sequences that led to disease-related variants were identified in 23 of the 68 cases, or nearly 34 percent of the time. The researchers had even more success making diagnoses for individuals with de novo or recessively inherited conditions. There, they diagnosed 57 percent of cases when genome sequences from the affected individual and both parents were available. When they delved into technical features that may impact successful diagnoses, the researchers determined that slight jumps or dips in sequence coverage across different portions of the genome did not seem to significantly impact their ability to track down disease-causing variants. On the other hand, the team highlighted the importance of analytical approaches for calling variants and identifying those with ties to a given condition. For instance, by combining a two-stage variant calling process with local database filtering and multiple algorithms for annotating the genome, the study's authors found that it was possible to identify variants more effectively dial, leading to more accurate diagnoses. Although most of the disease culprits identified in the current study fell in protein-coding sequences that would have been interrogated by exome sequencing, they noted, the full genome sequences proved useful for finding potential non-coding contributors to disease and characterizing inheritance patterns for disease-related glitches within genes. Still, the team cautioned that whole-genome sequencing may be unnecessarily time-consuming or complex when dealing with conditions inherited dominantly or when insufficient information on other family members, inheritance patterns, or clinical features are available. ""Ultimately, whole-genome sequencing will only be able to reliably assess the diagnostic and predictive value of ay specific variant if this variant, or another variant in the same gene, is identified in other individuals with the same disorder for whom detailed phenotypic and clinical data are available,"" McVean and co-authors concluded.","Published: May 19, 2015"

Dr Mark Travis and his team at the Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research have been studying an important cell that prevents harmful immune responses. Their research detailing how regulatory T cells can cure inflammatory disease has been published in the journal Immunity. T cells are important in fighting infection as they re mostly designed to act against foreign invaders to the body such as pathogens. But there are some T-cells that react and attack our own tissues, resulting in autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Regulatory T cells are crucial cells in stopping these harmful T cells from causing disease, and are therefore being used as potential therapies to treat autoimmune diseases. The Manchester researchers have identified new and crucial molecules which allow regulatory T cells to function and cure active inflammation during disease. Dr Travis explains the importance of their work:  Regulatory T cells are already being used in clinical trials where the cells are taken from the patient, multiplied and then given back to the patient to suppress their illness. By understanding the mechanisms behind how regulatory T cells work, we could improve on these therapies, which can be potentially useful in conditions ranging from type 1 diabetes to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.  This knowledge is vitally important when trying to make regulatory T-cells for therapy. By knowing the importance of this pathway, we can now work to improve the suppressive nature of regulatory T cells to make them more effective as treatments for disease.  He continues:  It s fascinating that getting rid of just one molecule can have such an impact on the body s ability to fight disease. Our research is all about how the molecules interlink and react to each other, and in certain situations targeting just one molecule can boost or inhibit a response.  For this paper the Manchester researchers demonstrated that the same molecules are expressed in humans as well as animal models. The next step will be to look at how the mechanism works in humans during disease, for which they plan to target inflammatory bowel disease. Dr John Worthington, a Wellcome Trust Stepping Stones Fellow, worked alongside Dr Travis on the paper:  We re hopeful this research will have a real impact on treatment therapies that use regulatory T cells, either by boosting their function by targeting this pathway or by cherry picking the very best regulatory cells to prevent autoimmunity.

Single CTCs are extremely rare, typically fewer than 1 in 1 billion cells. These cells can take up residence in distant organs, and researchers believe this is one mode by which cancer spreads.  Even less common than single CTCs are small groups of CTCs, or clusters. While the existence of CTC clusters has been known for more than 50 years, their prevalence in the blood as well as their role in metastasis has not been thoroughly investigated, mostly because they are so elusive. However, recent advances in biomedical technologies that enable researchers to capture single CTCs have renewed interest in CTC clusters, which are occasionally captured along with single CTCs.  Now, researchers led by Mehmet Toner, Ph.D., report the development of a novel microfluidic chip that is specifically designed for the efficient capture of CTC clusters from whole, unprocessed blood.   Very little is known about CTC clusters and their role in the progression and metastasis of cancer. This unique technology presents an exciting opportunity to capture these exceptionally rare groups of cells for further analysis in a way that is minimally-invasive,  said NIBIB Director Roderic I. Pettigrew, Ph.D., M.D.  This is the kind of breakthrough technology that could have a very large impact on cancer research.  Toner and his collaborator Dr. Daniel Haber, M.D., Ph.D., recently used their new technology, Cluster-Chip, to capture and analyze CTC clusters in a group of 60 patients with metastatic breast, prostate, and melanoma cancers. The researchers found CTC clusters   ranging from two to 19 cells   in 30-40 percent of the patients. Magnification of circulating Tumor Cell Cluster Captured by Cluster-Chip. Credit: Sarioglu et al., Nature Methods   The presence of these clusters is far more common than we thought in the past,  said Toner.  The fact that we saw clusters in this many patients is really a remarkable finding.  The chip is designed to slowly push blood through many rows of microscopic triangle-shaped posts. The posts are arranged in such a way that every two posts funnels cells towards the tip of a third post. At the tip, single cells   including blood cells and single CTCs   easily slide to either side of the post and continue through the chip until reaching the next tip; however CTC clusters are left at the tip, hanging in the balance due to forces pulling them down the post in opposite directions.  To determine the efficiency of Cluster-Chip, the researchers introduced fluorescently tagged cell clusters (ranging from 2-30 cells) into the chip and counted the number of clusters that were captured and the number that flowed through undetected. At a blood flow rate of 2.5ml/hr, the chip captured 99 percent of clusters containing four or more cells, 70 percent of three-cell clusters, and 41 percent of two-cell clusters. Comparison of the clusters under a microscope before and after capture found that the chip had no negative effects on the integrity of the clusters as a whole. The researchers went on to test the Cluster-Chip in a small trial of 60 patients with metastatic cancer. In this study, the chip captured CTC clusters in 11 of 27 (40.7 percent) breast cancer patients, 6 of 20 (30 percent) melanoma patients, and 4 of 13 (31 percent) prostate patients. The large number of clusters found in the patient samples suggests a possibly greater role for clusters in the metastatic cascade. While the significance of CTC clusters has not been fully established, a previous study published by Toner and the Haber team in Cell (2014) found an association between increased number of CTC clusters in patients with metastatic breast cancer and reduced survival, and an association between the presence of clusters and reduced survival in prostate cancer patients. To characterize the biology of the clusters, the researchers measured a marker of tumor cell proliferation   an indicator of increased invasiveness and poor outcomes   in one breast cancer patient with high numbers of both single CTCs and clusters. Approximately half of the cells in the patient s clusters were positive for the proliferative marker, demonstrating that clusters can contain both actively proliferating and quiescent cells. The researchers also noted the rare presence of non-tumor cells within clusters in less than 5 percent of patients.  The fact that some CTC clusters contain immune cells is of particular interest,  said Pettigrew.  Given the increasing number of cancer therapies that engage the immune system, the ability to monitor tumor-immune cell interactions via the blood could be of great value.  Toner anticipates that the Cluster-Chip will play an important role in stimulating new research on CTC cluster biology:  It s like poking a sleeping bear. It could really awaken the field to go after clusters and to develop even better technologies to understand their biology in cancer metastasis. ","Published: May 19, 2015"

Metal mesoporous films could have fascinating and useful optical properties as they are effectively the inverse of nanoparticle arrays. Now for the first time a collaboration of researchers in Japan, Turkey, Korea and Sweden demonstrate a simple approach for producing metal films with regular tuneable mesopores, and show their potential for high-sensitivity optical detection. When light is incident on nanostructures of noble metals such as gold, the electrons oscillate collectively   a so-called plasmon   and this greatly enhances the electromagnetic field close by. According to Babinet s principle in optics, the inverse structure   a mesoporous film   should lead to similar local electromagnetic field enhancements, but as Yamauchi and his colleagues point out in their report, controlling gold crystal growth well enough to produce mesoporous films has so far been difficult. The success of their approach relies on electrochemistry and micelle self-assembly. They dissolve hydrogen gold chloride (or chloroauric acid, HAuCl4) and polystyrene-block -poly(oxyethylene) in a solution of tetrahydrofuran, which leads to the formation of micelles with a polystyrene core and polyoxyethylene shell. The micelles reduce the AuCl4- ions so that gold deposits on the micelles. The result is highly regular gold mesopores with a size that can be tuned by varying the concentrations of the HAuCl4 and polystyrene-block -poly(oxyethylene). Calculations showed that hotspots of high electric field enhancement indeed exist in the pores of the structure, and the plasmon resonances can be tuned by changing the pore size. Further experiments confirmed the surface enhancement of protein spectral signatures, known as surface enhanced Raman scattering. The researchers conclude,  The electrochemical approach is widely applicable to embed uniform mesopores in other metal and alloy systems, which are generally difficult to be synthesized.

Published in Genome Biology, the research into  domain atrophy  offers new insights into the evolution, molecular mechanism, stability and function of protein domains. Proteins are everywhere, performing an endless variety of tasks to keep life moving along. They are made up of independent units called protein domains, which can be assembled in different combinations to build full proteins to order. Protein domains are defined by core structural elements, much in the same way a gear on a bike, watch or car can be defined by the number, size and arrangement of its cogs. But are protein domains really indivisible? The researchers set out to answer this question computationally by searching and comparing millions of protein sequences and hundreds of protein structures in public databases. They identified a small percentage of protein domains that have been retained throughout evolution, functioning just like their ancestors, despite having undergone large-scale structural deletions.  You can think of protein domains like cogs in an engine, with all these teeth that interlock and make each other move,  explains Ananth Prakash of EMBL-EBI.  You can assume that a cog will need all its teeth to make a good enough connection to work properly. But we found that with some protein domains, the engine parts keep moving even if a large number of those  teeth  are missing.   Normally, you d expect large-scale deletions, which we call domain atrophy, to inhibit a domain s function and cause unfolding,  adds Alex Bateman, head of Protein Sequence Resources at EMBL-EBI.  Given that a mutation in a single residue can lead to a human disease, it is simply amazing that proteins can tolerate such extreme mutations.  The team started with two major public resources, UniProt and Pfam, selecting only the most robust entries and using a new algorithm to identify cases of partial protein domains. By painstakingly sifting through the results, like panning for gold, they collected a small set of protein domains with large-scale deletions in their core structural elements.  Most atrophied domains retain structural elements or catalytic residues that are crucial for the normal functioning of a protein, which only makes sense,  says Ananth.  Interestingly, most of them appear to compensate for those atrophied sections by forming complexes with other partners.  At the ISMB conference in 2014, members of the Bateman team at EMBL-EBI and the Pearson group at the University of Virginia discovered that they had both been working along the same lines. Both groups agree that domain atrophy is extremely rare and that for the most part, protein domains are indivisible, structural building blocks. But their findings reveal a fascinating phenomenon, and the shared terminologies developed by the groups will help future investigations into the molecular mechanisms that cause parts of these protein domains to disappear in the first place.","Published: May 19, 2015"

Timing matters to the structure of human speech. For example, phonemes are the shortest, most basic unit of speech and last an average of 30 to 60 milliseconds. By comparison, syllables take longer: 200 to 300 milliseconds. Most whole words are longer still. In order to understand speech, the brain needs to somehow integrate this rapidly evolving information. The auditory system, like other sensory systems, likely takes shortcuts to cope with the onslaught of information -- by, for example, sampling information in chunks similar in length to that of an average consonant or syllable, says study co-author Tobias Overath, an assistant research professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. The other corresponding author is Josh McDermott from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In a study appearing in the journal Nature Neuroscience, Overath and his collaborators cut recordings of foreign speech into short chunks ranging from 30 to 960 milliseconds in length, and then reassembled the pieces using a novel algorithm to create new sounds that the authors call 'speech quilts'. The shorter the pieces of the resulting speech quilts, the greater the disruption was to the original structure of the speech. To measure the activity of neurons in real time, the scientists played speech quilts to study participants while scanning their brains in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine. The team hypothesized that brain areas involved in speech processing would show larger responses to speech quilts made up of longer segments. Indeed, a region of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus (STS) became highly active during the 480- and 960-millisecond quilts compared with the 30-millisecond quilts. In contrast, other areas of the brain involved in processing sound did not change their response as a result of the differences in the sound quilts. ""That was pretty exciting. We knew we were onto something,"" said Overath, who is a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences The superior temporal sulcus is known to integrate auditory and other sensory information. But no one has shown that the STS is sensitive to time structures in speech. To rule out other explanations for the activation of the STS, the researchers tested numerous control sounds they created to mimic speech. One of the synthetic sounds they created shared the frequency of speech but lacked its rhythms. Another removed all the pitch from the speech. A third used environmental sounds. They quilted each of these control stimuli, chopping them up in either 30- or 960-millisecond pieces and stitching them back together, before playing them to participants. The STS didn't seem responsive to the quilting manipulation when it was applied to these control sounds. ""We really went to great lengths to be certain that the effect we were seeing in STS was due to speech-specific processing and not due to some other explanation, for example, pitch in the sound or it being a natural sound as opposed to some computer-generated sound,"" Overath said. The group plans to study whether the response in STS is similar for foreign speech that is phonetically much different than English, such as Mandarin, or quilts of familiar speech that is intelligible and has meaning. For familiar speech they might see stronger activation on the left side of the brain, which is thought to be dominant in processing language. Duke University   press release Tobias Overath, Josh H.

The bacteria are the smallest free-living organisms that lack cell walls, something which makes them resistant to common antibiotics like penicillin. There are currently no vaccines available for humans and pets, or for farm animals apart from pigs and poultry. This project is important because it s a real-world application of synthetic biology that has huge potential for tackling a serious health problem in humans and animals, says Dr Mark Isalan. Now, biologists in the MycoSynVac project propose to engineer the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumonia, removing its ability to cause disease, to create a vaccine  chassis . This would be used to carry selected antigens for fighting different Mycoplasma pathogens. This should create an effective vaccine, using a live but weakened version of the infectious bacteria to prepare the immune system for any potential attacks. The researchers believe that the vaccine chassis would be adaptable and easier to produce than traditional vaccines for this group of diseases. Two vaccines currently exist for Mycoplasma diseases in pigs and poultry, but they require a complex growth medium, making production slow and prone to errors. The scientists aim to improve the new Mycoplasma chassis using bioengineering techniques, so that it grows faster in a simpler medium, reducing inefficiency and improving production. Mycoplasma traditionally grows very slowly, but the researchers intend to modify it to reproduce more like faster-growing bacterial species. Dr Mark Isalan, a reader in gene network engineering from the Department of Life Sciences and Imperial College London, is a partner in the project. He said:  This project is important because it s a real-world application of synthetic biology that has huge potential for tackling a serious health problem in humans and animals.

In a step towards translating bacterial communications, researchers have revealed the structure and biosynthesis of streptide, a peptide involved in the quorum sensing system common to many streptococci. ""It's extremely rare for one research group to do both natural products discovery and mechanistic enzymology,"" said Leah Bushin, a member of the Seyedsayamdost lab and co-first author on the article published in Nature Chemistry. Bushin worked on elucidating the structure of streptide as part of her undergraduate senior thesis project and will enter Princeton Chemistry's graduate program in the fall. To explore how bacteria communicate, first she had to grow them, a challenging process in which oxygen had to be rigorously excluded. Next she isolated the streptide and analyzed it using 2-D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a technique that allows scientists to deduce the connections between atoms in a molecule by pulsing their nuclei with powerful magnets to pulse atomic nuclei. The experiments revealed that streptide contained an unprecedented crosslink between two unactivated carbons on lysine and tryptophan, constituting a new class of macrocyclic peptides. ""We didn't think it would be as cool as a carbon-carbon bond between two amino acid side chains, so it was definitely a surprise."" said Bushin. To figure out how this novel bond was being formed, the researchers took a closer look at the gene cluster that produced streptide. Within the gene cluster, they suspected a radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) enzyme, which they dubbed StrB, could be responsible for this unusual modification. ""Radical SAM enzymes catalyze absolutely amazing chemistries,"" said Kelsey Schramma, a graduate student in the Seyedsayamdost lab and co-first author on the article. ""There are over 48,000 radical SAM enzymes, but only about 50 have been characterized and just a dozen or so studied in detail,"" she said. To probe the enzyme's role in making streptide, the researchers created a mutated version of the bacteria lacking the strB gene. The mutant failed to produce streptide, confirming that the StrB enzyme was significant and warranted further study. Schramma determined that in order to function properly, the StrB enzyme required some key components: the pre-crosslinked substrate, which she prepared synthetically, cofactor SAM, reductant, and two iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters carefully assembled in the protein interior. The team then showed that one of the FeS clusters reductively activated one molecule of SAM, kicking off a chain of one-electron (radical) reactions that gave rise to the novel carbon-carbon bond. ""The synergy between Leah and Kelsey was great,"" said Mohammad Seyedsayamdost, an assistant professor of chemistry at Princeton who led the research team. ""They expressed interest in complementary aspects of the project and the whole ended up being greater than the sum of its parts,"" he said. Their efforts included not only chemical and biological approaches, but also theoretical computational studies. While the 2-D NMR experiments revealed the flat structure of streptide, its 3-D conformation was still unknown. ""Since the crosslink had never been reported, we had to code the modification into the program, which took a bit of creativity,"" Bushin said. After corresponding with the software creator, they were able to confidently assign a key residue in the macrocycle with the S-configuration. Future work will target streptide's biological function its meaning in the bacterial language as well as confirming its production by other streptococcal bacteria strains. ""What we have revealed is a new and unusual mechanism that nature uses to synthesize macrocyclic peptides. There is a lot of novel chemistry to be discovered by interrogating bacterial secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways,"" Seyedsayamdost said.","Published: May 18, 2015"

Ensuring patients get the right treatment is important both from an emotional and financial perspective. It relies on accurate equipment to support the correct diagnosis. Surprisingly, in such a sensitive area of andrology - the study of human reproduction - the testing of sperm for properties such as size, number and motility is not consistently controlled. One parameter key to successful testing is temperature. It is vital to test sperm at normal body temperature, i.e. 37 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is too low, sperm motility is reduced; if the temperature is too high, the sperm may be irreparably damaged. Either way, the diagnosis may be incorrect leading to the wrong treatment being offered.  Testing is performed using a basic light microscope which is used to observe the sperm performance on a heated glass slide. Control of the temperature has been seen as arbitrary from lab to lab and hence there can be a wide variance in reported results.  Mr Stephen Harbottle is the Consultant Embryologist and Person Responsible at Cambridge IVF. With more than 20 years direct hands-on experience in embryology and diagnostic andrology, Stephen has observed the inconsistencies of testing and was very happy to be directly involved in advising Linkam Scientific Instruments on the development of suitable instrumentation to reliably test sperm. He observed the problem:  There is a real need for consistency of testing in andrology laboratories. At present, there is inconsistency with labs performing tests using non-validated or out of date procedures with limited regulation or control. Equipment is not standardised; it is not being calibrated and validated against reference systems or used in accordance with best practice recommendations in some test centres. Testing should be done to a validated standard operating procedure and labs performing tests should ensure they are registered to an appropriate external quality assurance scheme.  For Linkam, with more than 30 years' experience developing and manufacturing temperature controlled microscopy stages, the challenge was one that required a system that could easily maintain a user-defined temperature between ambient and 60 C to +/-0.2 C, while allowing high resolution observation. The system would also require easy calibration, be of low entry price and have minimal running costs. Working with Mr Harbottle, Linkam's engineering team have come up with an innovative approach which incorporates a simple and visual temperature validation using a specially developed liquid crystal temperature sensitive slide to enable temperature calibration.

Conducted through the University of Toronto s Donnelly Center for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, the group s study ( A Hyaluronan-Based Injectable Hydrogel Improves the Survival and Integration of Stem Cell Progeny following Transplantation ) was published in Stem Cell Reports. Dr. Shoichet, a bioengineer who recently won the L'Oreal-UNESCO for Women in Science Award, and her team created the hydrogel several years ago as a kind of a bubble wrap to hold cells together during transport and delivery into a transplant site. ""This study goes one step further, showing that the hydrogels do more than just hold stem cells together; they directly promote stem cell survival and integration. This brings stem-cell based therapy closer to reality"" says Dr. Shoichet, a professor whose affiliations span the Donnelly Center, the department of chemical engineering and applied chemistry and the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at U of T. In addition to examining how the stem cells benefit from life in hydrogels, the researchers also showed that these new cells could help restore function that was lost due to damage or disease. One part of the study involved the team injecting hydrogel-encapsulated photoreceptors, grown from stem cells, into the eyes of blind mice. Photoreceptors are the light sensing cells responsible for vision in the eye. With increased cell survival and integration in the stem cells, they were able to partially restore vision. ""After cell transplantation, our measurements showed that mice with previously no visual function regained approximately 15% of their pupillary response. Their eyes are beginning to detect light and respond appropriately,"" explains Brian Ballios, Ph.D., an expert in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine for retinal degenerative disease, who led this part of the study. In another part of the study, Michael Cooke, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow, injected the stem cells into the brains of mice who had recently suffered strokes.  After transplantation, within weeks we started seeing improvements in the mice's motor coordination,"" says Dr. Cooke. His team now wants to carry out similar experiments in larger animals, such as rats, who have larger brains that are better suited for behavioral tests, to further investigate how stem cell transplants can help heal a stroke injury. According to Dr. Shoichet, because the hydrogel could boost cell survival in two different parts of the nervous system, the eye and the brain, it could potentially be used in transplants across many different body sites. Another advantage of the hydrogel is that, once it has delivered cells to a desired place, it dissolves and is reabsorbed by the body within a few weeks.","Published: May 18, 2015"

The study found that canals designed to channel rainwater host microbial communities that could remove and neutralise organic pollutants in raw water. These organic pollutants are currently at trace levels in raw water   well below the United States-Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) drinking water standards   which is removed during water treatment processes.   Researchers from the NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI) and the Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have discovered that the untapped natural ability of microbial communities could be harnessed to treat raw water even before undergoing treatment.  This process is known as  bioremediation , a treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down organic pollutants.  The study, which was published in the scientific journal Environmental Science & Technology, was conducted around the Ulu Pandan catchment area in collaboration with the Singapore s national water agency, PUB. Microbes   Nature s  garbage cleaners  The increased demand for water in urban centres, coupled with the elevated pressures placed on the environment by high-density living, has created a demand for efficient, environmentally sustainable solutions to manage urban watersheds. Harnessing the cleansing power of microbes provides a solution to the pressing need. The breakthrough came about after the joint research team identified members of the entire microbial community and their functions from the aquatic ecosystem at the Ulu Pandan catchment area by extracting their DNA and RNA, the genetic blueprint of life. Apart from the discovery that the microbes could remove and neutralise organic pollutants, the researchers also found out that the presence of aluminium, copper and potassium were critical to the community s ability to perform its ecological  cleansing  properties. The discovery of these chemical elements  influence on the microbial community s functions paves the way for researchers to better understand their  cleansing  performance through further monitoring and study. The project s lead scientist, Associate Professor Sanjay Swarup, Deputy Director of NERI and a Research Director at SCELSE said,  This study demonstrates the power of combining an in-depth analysis of microbial community ecology with physical and chemical characteristics.   More importantly, with the support of government administrators, environmental sustainability could be achieved naturally through science, creating a better living environment for both man and nature.  The study also examined the differences of microbial communities in residential and industrial watershed systems. It was discovered that these two microbial communities perform different functions, which shows how various land use could influence the types of microbes and the functions they are capable of performing. Dr Gourvendu Saxena, Research Fellow at NERI and SCELSE said,  Knowing what the microbes are doing provides information on what they are responding to. These marker-based microbial functions provide a higher resolving power than chemical markers that are currently in use.   This study has enabled us to identify the key drivers of microbial communities and their functions at a watershed-scale. The findings can be used to understand microbial activity responsible for removing and neutralizing organic pollutants, which is critical to developing ecologically friendly waterways in rapidly urbanizing environments,  said Dr Saxena who is the lead author of the study. The study also found that the Ulu Pandan catchment area was not only well-managed but is an efficient drainage system, with pollutants below the baseline safety limits.  Professor Staffan Kjelleberg, Centre Director for SCELSE at NTU said,  For decades scientists have pursued research projects that seek to understand microbes' ability to chew-up stubborn pollutants.   This breakthrough proves that it may be possible to push the boundaries in securing the availability of clean water through natural means and hence, maintain a more sustainable environment for Singapore and other societies.  Next phase of research The research framework laid out in this study could be easily adopted by other cities around the world in studying their own waterways, and is being adopted by the international World Harbour Project, to which SCELSE is a party of.  The World Harbour Project is a coordinated network of researchers and managers, to bring the best practices in understanding and managing urban waterways to the world. Moving forward, the team will continue to investigate the microbial communities  ability to self-cleanse the waterways. This is done by understanding the response to manipulating key metals, identifying the most efficient microbial community composition and establishing the conditions needed for optimal bioremediation.  Plans are in place to study the effects of plants on microbial communities and explore various waterways structure designs to determine optimal settings and parameters. This joint study was conducted with key investigators from NERI and SCELSE, involving 17 researchers from institutions in Singapore, Sydney, Australia, Oklahoma, and Berkeley in the USA, and Beijing, China.","Published: May 18, 2015"

The handshake, in this case, is between an attachment protein, which is a sort of three-fingered hand at the end of a fimbrius, one of a bacterium s many  arms,  and one of the innumerable sugar-like molecules that stud the surfaces of human cells. The attachment protein can be tricked into grasping other things, leaving our cells unmolested, but even so, bacteria often manage to get a hold of our cells anyway, by one sleight of hand or another. Fortunately, the bacterial hand is not always quicker than the scientific eye, as a team of scientists at the University of Washington has demonstrated. These scientists, led by Evgeni V. Sokurenko, Ph.D., took a close look at strains of Escherichia coli that cause urinary tract infections. What the scientists saw helped them figure out how an attachment-protein-blocking antibody failed to prevent urinary tract infections in humans. By learning what the bacterium had up its sleeve, the scientists were able to come up with a better antibody one that made good use of an unusual hold of its own. A common bacterium-blocking strategy is to fill the attachment protein hand with an antibody. The attachment protein, however, isn t static. It fluctuates between strong- and weak-gripping conformations, so it can slip loose and resume its greeting-line ways. Worse, the bacterium can seize free-floating sugars, which effectively compete with antibodies, making them less effective. The researchers, however, hit upon another approach. They deployed an antibody that works  parasterically from the side. Essentially, the antibody takes hold of one of the attachment protein s fingers, keeping the attachment protein in a more relaxed conformation. The antibody can even seize the finger if the attachment protein is already in a closed conformation, loosening the attachment protein s grip. Thus, the antibody may serve not only as a vaccine to prevent bacterial infection, it could be used to treat an infection that has already started. This finding appeared, in an article entitled,  Inhibition and Reversal of Microbial Attachment by an Antibody with Parasteric Activity against the FimH Adhesin of Uropathogenic E. coli.  This article described how an antibody called Ab926 was able, through parasteric inhibition, to prevent bacteria from attaching to the sugar mannose. In addition, Ab926 could force the bacteria that were already attached to let go, something the other antibodies evaluated in the study could not do.  Here, using monoclonal antibodies against a vaccine target protein fimbrial adhesin FimH of uropathogenic E. coli, we demonstrate that unusually strong receptor inhibition can be achieved by antibody that binds within the binding pocket and displaces the ligand in a noncompetitive way,  the authors wrote.  The noncompetitive antibody binds to a loop that interacts with the ligand in the active conformation of the pocket but is shifted away from ligand in the inactive conformation.  The authors added that the receptor-blocking mechanism of the parasteric antibody is very potent in blocking bacterial adhesion, dissolving surface-adherent biofilms and protecting mice from urinary bladder infection. ""FimH is like a three-fingered hand that closes around the mannose when it binds,"" Dr. Sokurenko explained. ""But the pocket is dynamic and intermittently tightens and loosens its grip."" This makes sense, he continued, because the bacteria need to be able to release themselves and move if they're to travel around the urinary tract and invade tissues. In the case of FimH, the loosening takes place when one of the fingers lifts away, momentarily relaxing the pocket's grip on the mannose. What appears to happen is mAb926 binds to this finger when the pocket is in this relaxed state and prevents it from closing again. As a result, FimH is unable to hold onto the mannose and lets go. This parasteric action has two advantages over the classical antibody action, the University of Washington scientists explained. First, unlike the other type of antibodies, this antibody does not have to compete with free-floating mannose for access to the FimH pocket. This means it should be more effective at disabling FimH before it binds to its target. Second, because it can also act on FimH even after bacteria has attached to bladder cells and disable its pocket whenever it relaxes its grip. This raises the possibility that antibodies of this type could be used to treat established E. coli infections by loosening the bacterium's grip so it can be flushed off the wall of the bladder and urinary tract.","Published: May 18, 2015"

They tested these prints against more commonly used saliva samples to determine whether the two tests correlated. While previous fingerprint tests have employed similar methods, they have only been able to show whether a person had touched cocaine, and not whether they have actually taken the drug.  When someone has taken cocaine, they excrete traces of benzoylecgonine and methylecgonine as they metabolise the drug, and these chemical indicators are present in fingerprint residue,  said lead author Dr Melanie Bailey from the University of Surrey.  For our part of the investigations, we sprayed a beam of solvent onto the fingerprint slide (a technique known as Desorption Electrospray Ionisation, or DESI) to determine if these substances were present. DESI has been used for a number of forensic applications, but no other studies have shown it to demonstrate drug use.  Researchers believe that the applications for this test could be far-reaching. Drug testing is used routinely by probation services, prisons, courts and other law enforcement agencies. However, traditional testing methods have limitations. For example, blood testing requires trained staff and there are privacy concerns about urine testing. Where bodily fluids are tested, there can be biological hazards and often a requirement for particular storage and disposal methods. Often these tests also require analysis off-site.  The beauty of this method is that, not only is it non-invasive and more hygienic than testing blood or saliva, it can t be faked,  added Dr Bailey.  By the very nature of the test, the identity of the subject is captured within the fingerprint ridge detail itself.  It is anticipated that this technology could see the introduction of portable drug tests for law enforcement agencies to use within the next decade.  We are only bound by the size of the current technology. Companies are already working on miniaturised mass spectrometers, and in the future portable fingerprint drugs tests could be deployed. This will help to protect the public and indeed provide a much safer test for drug users,  said Dr Bailey.","Published: May 18, 2015"

For instance, he writes that single-molecule study of turnover oxidase, a cholesterol enzyme, has underscored that single-molecule chemical reaction are stochastic, rather than deterministic, as they appear when a greater number of molecules are studies. As DNA is present as single molecules as chromosomes in cells, Xie notes that changes to it, too, are stochastic, necessitating the need for single-cell genomics. Currently, much of single-cell genomics relies on MALBAC   multiple annealing  and looping-based amplification cycles   to amplify the genome to more easily detected level, a method developed by Xie and his colleagues. This method, he writes, has been applied to in vitro fertilization procedures as well as cancer diagnoses. It allows scientists to determine the copy number of genes and single nucleotide variations. ""The ability to count the copy numbers of a gene and detect a point mutation in a single cell is now not only possible, but is critically important as well,"" Xie adds.

Since his arrival at UC Santa Cruz in 2006, Berman has established a major vaccine research effort funded by a series of grants from the National Institutes of Health, including two new grants in 2014 totaling $2.6 million. Berman has redesigned a vaccine that he invented while at Genentech and led through clinical testing at VaxGen. This earlier vaccine, called AIDSVAX, was used in combination with another experimental vaccine in a large-scale clinical trial in Thailand involving 16,000 people. This trial (known as RV 144) showed that the combined vaccine was safe and 31 percent effective in preventing new HIV infections. After the results of the trial were released in 2009, Berman and other researchers pored over them to understand the nature of the protective effect. Although the effect was small, RV 144 is still the only clinical trial in which a vaccine has shown any protective effect at all against HIV infection. ""By analyzing the results from RV 144, we started to understand the response to the vaccine, and I developed some new ideas for how to improve it,"" Berman said. ""By building on an existing vaccine concept, rather than developing a new one from scratch, we can save millions of dollars and years of time getting the new vaccine into the clinic."" Researchers believe that for an AIDS vaccine to be effective, it must stimulate the immune system to make ""broadly neutralizing antibodies"" that are effective against multiple strains of the virus. HIV is so highly mutable that replication of the virus in an infected person gives rise to a genetically diverse population of circulating virus, and this variability helps the virus evade detection and neutralization by the immune system. A neutralizing antibody recognizes a foreign protein (called an antigen), and by binding to it is able to block or neutralize the infectivity of the virus. For example, neutralizing antibodies that target an HIV envelope protein called gp120 can block a crucial part of the infection process in which gp120 binds to a receptor on the surface of T cells. The AIDSVAX vaccine was based on the gp120 envelope protein. One key to improving the vaccine, Berman said, came from independent lines of investigation pointing to the importance of antibodies that recognize a specific segment of gp120 known as the V1/V2 domain. The RV 144 trial results showed that protection was correlated with antibodies to this domain. Meanwhile, broadly neutralizing antibodies to this domain were isolated from a rare group of people known as ""elite neutralizers,"" who produce antibodies that potently neutralize multiple strains of the virus. Studies of these broadly neutralizing antibodies yielded another crucial finding. The part of an antigen that is recognized by an antibody is called an epitope, and it is usually a specific sequence of amino acids in the antigen protein. Scientists studying antibodies from elite neutralizers, however, discovered that many of the most potent neutralizing antibodies actually recognize carbohydrate components called glycans that are attached to the gp120 envelope protein. ""We knew that these broadly neutralizing antibodies existed for many years, but it came as a great surprise that they were directed to carbohydrate epitopes rather than the more common amino acid epitopes,"" Berman said. ""We found that the vaccine that gave partial protection in the RV 144 trial had very little of the kind of carbohydrate required to bind these antibodies."" So Berman's lab set out to produce antigens that would induce a strong antibody response to the glycan-dependent epitopes in the V1/V2 domain. Attaching the right kind of glycans to the protein was just one of the challenges. The envelope protein has dozens of epitopes, and most of the immune response is directed at ones that don't induce neutralizing antibodies. Compared to these so-called ""decoy epitopes,"" the glycan-dependent epitopes are only weakly immunogenic. Berman decided to use fragments of gp120 to make protein scaffolds that would present to the immune system only the glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, while eliminating the other gp120 epitopes. ""The trick is to make the scaffolds fold up into the right three-dimensional shape, as well as incorporating the right glycans,"" he said. Berman's lab is now developing cell lines genetically engineered to produce viral proteins with the right structure and glycan epitopes to bind to broadly neutralizing antibodies with high affinity. This strong binding suggests that vaccination with these antigens could stimulate the immune system to produce the broadly neutralizing antibodies. In a paper published last year in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Berman's team described the results of immunogenicity studies of these antigens. ""I think we've got candidates that should be seriously considered for advancement to clinical testing,"" Berman said. ""We started with a molecule that has already been tested in humans, and we've rebuilt it using envelope proteins and scaffolds with the right carbohydrates."" Berman's lab is continuing to generate and screen new cell lines, looking for those that give the most consistent and reproducible production of antigens that perform well in immunogenicity studies.

Sepsis is a whole-body inflammation syndrome set off when the immune system wildly overreacts to the presence of infectious pathogens. It is the leading cause of hospital deaths in the United States, accounting for nearly half of the total number, and is tied to the early deaths of at least 750,000 Americans each year. Its estimated annual cost to the health-care system exceeds $24 billion. The great majority of sepsis cases are caused by bacterial rather than viral infections and are best treated with antibiotics. But antibiotics are unhelpful   and can be counterproductive   when a patient has an outwardly similar but infection-free syndrome called sterile inflammation, an intense, systemic inflammatory response to traumatic injuries, surgery, blood clots or other noninfectious causes.  It s critical for clinicians to diagnose sepsis accurately and quickly, because the risk of death from this condition increases with every passing hour it goes untreated,  said Purvesh Khatri, PhD, assistant professor of biomedical informatics research. Sepsis or sterile inflammation? In practice, distinguishing sepsis from sterile inflammation is a toss-up. Right now, the only diagnostics that can help do this are too slow or too inaccurate, or both, Khatri said. As a result, hospital clinicians are pressured to treat anybody showing signs of systemic inflammation with antibiotics. That can encourage bacterial drug resistance and, by killing off harmless bacteria in the gut, lead to colonization by pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. The inability to easily distinguish sepsis from sterile inflammation makes it tough for pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials of drugs aimed at treating sepsis; patients may be mistakenly assumed to have sepsis when they in fact have sterile inflammation, and vice versa, Khatri said.  We think we ve got the makings of a diagnostic blood test that will allow clinicians to distinguish between these two types of inflammation,  he said. Khatri is the senior author of the new study, published May 13 in Science Translational Medicine, in which a meta-analysis of publicly available data sets allowed him and his associates to tease out a gene-activation pattern that distinguishes septic from sterile systemic inflammation.  We thought there might be some genes that the body turns on specifically in response to infection, and after sifting through a huge amount of data we found them,  said lead author Timothy Sweeney, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar now doing a residency in general surgery at Stanford. Numerous studies have been conducted to find differences in the activation levels of immune-response genes between infection-related inflammation and sterile inflammation. But these studies have yielded conflicting or murky results. One big reason is that both infection and noninfectious tissue trauma activate many of the same immune-system components and pathways. At the gene-activation level, the overlap is staggering: More than 80 percent of a person s roughly 25,000 genes change their activity levels substantially, and mostly in the same direction, in response to massive inflammation, whether due to sepsis or sterile causes. That overlap obscures any easily detectable changes attributable solely to infection. Needle in a haystack Further confounding attempts to identify patterns of increases or decreases in gene activity is that fact that some patients are already experiencing sepsis when they re admitted to the hospital, while others become infected during their hospital stay. So two different sepsis patients admitted at the same time may be at very different stages of a complex inflammation process.  How do you figure out which tiny fraction of those changes was caused by infection? You re looking for a needle in a haystack,  Khatri said. The needle, it turns out, consists of a signature formed by consistent changes in the activity levels of a mere 11 genes amid the chaotic background of the other 20,000-plus genes whose activity levels fluctuate markedly over the course of systemic inflammation and recovery. The Stanford sleuths analyzed a number of publicly available data sets containing results of studies that had assessed activity levels for the entire human genome in sepsis cases, as well as in cases of sterile inflammation. In all, they looked at more than 2,900 blood samples from nearly 1,600 patients in 27 different data sets containing medical information on diverse patient groups   men and women, young and old, suffering from sterile inflammation or sepsis, including patients who already had sepsis when first admitted to the hospital and patients who were diagnosed with it later   in addition to healthy control subjects. The analysis consisted of two separate steps. First, the researchers scoured nine data sets containing more than 650 patient samples. They looked for genes whose activity uniformly and substantially increased or decreased, across all nine data sets, in patients within 24 hours of a sepsis diagnosis compared with genes from those not diagnosed with sepsis. We were able to identify a slight bump in activity of these 11 genes in patients two to five days prior to their clinical diagnosis. Initially, whatever signal may have been hiding in this group of samples was buried in the surrounding noise of myriad irrelevant gene-activity fluctuations. But the cacophony ceased when the scientists adjusted their analytical approach by taking into account when the patient was injured or operated on. That way, the researchers could account for the changes, following a surgery or injury, in inflammation-related gene activity over time, independent of the presence or absence of infection. Blood samples were therefore time-matched according to how soon a blood sample was drawn after the initial injury or surgery. After this adjustment, 11 genes jumped out of the haystack as likely sepsis markers. The researchers confirmed this 11-gene signature in an additional 18 cohorts comprising in all more than 1,800 patient samples.  We were able to identify a slight bump in activity of these 11 genes in patients two to five days prior to their clinical diagnosis,  said Khatri. That could mean getting an earlier diagnosis than can be achieved with current approaches, which is key considering the rapid rate at which sepsis mortality rises once it gets a foothold. The gene-activation signature showed a sepsis-detecting accuracy surpassing that of methods now in use, Sweeney said. Combining the new technique with other current diagnostic methods is likely to be more accurate than using any one alone, he added. ","Published: May 18, 2015"

If you have a compass, you can know which way you're facing without knowing where you are. Animals from ants to mice to humans use both kinds of information to reorient themselves in familiar places, but how they determine this information from environmental cues is not well understood. In a new study in mice, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) have shown that these systems work independently. A cue that unambiguously provided both types of information allowed the mice to determine their location but not the direction they were facing.  The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted by graduate students Joshua Julian and Alexander Keinath, assistant professor Isabel Muzzio and professor Russell Epstein, all of the Department of Psychology in Penn s School of Arts & Sciences.    When you're lost,  Epstein said,  how do you reestablish your bearings? People have been studying this for more than 25 years, but they have not focused on the fact that place recognition, figuring out where you are, and heading retrieval, figuring out which way you re facing, could be two separate systems.  The team's experiment was an updated version of one of the original studies of reorientation, conducted at Penn by psychologists Ken Cheng and Randy Gallistel in 1986, which showed that rats use the shape of a room, but not other kinds of informative features, to get their bearings. To show this, the researchers in the 1986 study used a small rectangular room that had cups in each corner in which food could be hidden. From the bird s-eye view of the researchers, the food was always hidden in the northwest corner. From the rat s perspective, markings on the walls should have distinguished between the corners, enabling them to find the northwest corner every time. After researchers spun the rats around to get them to lose their bearings, however, the rats were equally likely to search in the southeast as they were in the northwest. This told the researchers that the rats   compasses  were calibrated to the geometry of the room. The rats were essentially learning that the food was always hidden in a corner where the long wall was on their left but apparently couldn t use the markings on the walls to tell which short wall was which.   These earlier reorientation studies,  Julian said,  taught us how the mental compass worked but did not tell us about the mental map. Because they were performed in single chamber environments in which there was no ambiguity about where the animal was in the world, they didn t tell us which of the environmental cues were used to recover the map. They only told us that geometry was used to recover the compass.  In the new version of the experiment, mice were trained on the location of food in two different rectangular rooms. These rooms were identical to each other, except the markings on their north walls were decorated with different features, vertical stripes in one, horizontal stripes in the other.   In order for the mice to find the reward,  Keinath said,  they must now solve two problems: first, which chamber am I in? And second, which way am I facing? In theory, the features could be used to solve both these problems. They could tell you both which room you re in and which way you re facing. In practice, however, that s not what we find.      To test how the mice made use of these two pieces of information, the food was hidden in different corners in the two rooms. In the vertical-stripe room, the food was always in the northwest corner, in the horizontal-stripe room, it was always in the northeast. If mice had a single reorientation system that acted as both map and compass, the mice would have been able to use the stripes to find the food every time. However, they still made the same kind of geometric error seen in the original reorientation experiment. In the vertical-stripe room the mice would gue ss between the northwest and southeast corners, and in the horizontal-stripe room they would guess between the northeast and southwest. This showed that the wall markings provided the map of which of the two rooms the mouse was in, but only geometric features were used to set the compass that told the animal which direction was which.      The way you figure out if two mental operations are independent,  Epstein said,  is that you find something that affects one and not the other. Because the mice go to different sets of corners in different rooms, we know they are using the stripes on the north wall to determine which room they are in. But despite the fact that the striped wall could also tell them which way they are facing, they don t use it for that.  Future work will involve running similar experiments while gathering direct brain recordings from the mice's  place cells.  The discovery of place cells and of related  grid cells  was the subject of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine; combined, they form the basis of the brain s positioning system.  We are currently recording from the hippocampus,  Muzzio said,  the brain region that contains place cells, to determine how spatial representations change when animals reorient in space. This will allow us to explore how the brain maps change when animals are using geometry versus cues."" University of Pennsylvania   press release Joshua B. Julian, Alexander T. Keinath, Isabel A.

The acquisition further accelerates the innovation capabilities and the commercial presence of Baxter BioScience in growing oncology markets for rare and orphan diseases. The company gains the leading marketed biologic treatment Oncaspar, the investigational biologic calaspargase pegol, and an established oncology infrastructure with clinical and sales resources. The Oncaspar transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. By mid-year, Baxter expects to establish the BioScience business as a separate, publicly traded, innovation-oriented biopharmaceutical company, Baxalta Incorporated. Oncaspar is a first-line biologic used as part of a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is currently marketed in the United States, Germany, Poland and certain other countries and has approximately USD $100 million in annual sales. ALL is a rapidly progressing cancer of the white blood cells responsible for more than 80 percent of childhood leukemia cases. ""The Baxter BioScience legacy of delivering solutions for orphan diseases and small patient populations and our global presence positions us well to accelerate the growth of the Oncaspar portfolio globally,"" said Ludwig Hantson, Ph.D., president of Baxter BioScience. ""With Oncaspar, Baxalta will bring an established standard of care therapy to more patients worldwide through the pursuit of additional indications and regulatory approvals across the globe.""

The protein NOS-1 generates nitric oxide, a chemical signal that is linked to neurological disorders from neurodegeneration, stroke and chronic pain sensitivity to anxiety and depressive disorders. These are now among the most common causes of disability and mortality, but decades of efforts have not led to a safe drug that controls NOS-1. The researchers involved in the new work previously found that neurodegeneration or brain lesions caused by NOS-1 requires it to bind another protein called NOS1AP (or CAPON). They asked if damage can be reduced by preventing binding of NOS1AP to NOS-1, as NOS-1 cannot directly be controlled by drugs. The researchers now reveal NOS1AP binds to NOS-1 in a surprisingly complex manner, and developed two separate ways to prevent it. By studying precisely how NOS1AP binds to NOS-1 they found two separate sites of interaction, by demonstrating that two different parts of NOS1AP are required for binding to NOS-1 on separate sites. Each site could be blocked, one by a peptide previously developed by the team and the other by a new synthetic protein generated for this study. The second site was completely unexpected as no similar interaction had been previously described and so nobody had known to look for it before. Blocking either site by itself reduced the damaging signals caused by NOS1 in brain cells. The results were replicated in several regions of brain tissue that are sensitive to degeneration caused by NOS-1. This means that it is now easier to design drugs that control damaging signals from NOS-1 in the brain because it can be done in two different ways or both ways may be combined. This might lead to development of new drugs for several different neurological diseases and conditions. This research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, was funded by the Academy of Finland, the European Union, the University of Eastern Finland, The Finnish Cultural Foundation North Savo Regional Fund, The Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation and the University of Turku. The researchers hope that continuation of their work could lead to improved treatments for neurological conditions such as stroke and chronic pain as well as depressive and anxiety disorders. As NOS1AP and NOS-1 are associated with schizophrenia and sudden cardiac death, future research in this area may even assist the treatment of a wider range of diseases.

Studying West Nile virus infection in mice, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis showed that interferon-lambda tightens the blood-brain barrier, making it harder for the virus to invade the brain. The blood-brain barrier is a natural defense system that is supposed to keep pathogens out of the brain. Sometimes, however, bacteria or viruses circulating in the blood slip past the blood-brain barrier, turning routine illnesses into serious infections. Interferon-lambda is produced naturally in the body in response to infection, but the new research suggests that larger amounts of the antiviral compound may tighten the blood-brain barrier against pathogens or possibly even faulty immune cells that can attack the brain and cause conditions such as multiple sclerosis. By blocking interferon-lambda's receptors in the brain, it may be possible one day to open the barrier to chemotherapies to treat specific diseases in the brain, such as tumors. Such tumors now are not optimally treated with chemotherapy drugs because the drugs can't cross the blood-brain barrier. The findings are available online in Science Translational Medicine. ""We have identified a new antiviral function of interferon-lambda that doesn't involve directly attacking a virus but stems viral invasion into the brain,"" said co-senior author Robyn Klein, MD, PhD, professor of medicine. ""This suggests the possibility of multiple new applications. We're testing one of these right now, conducting studies in mice to see if interferon-lambda can help prevent brain inflammation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis."" Other forms of interferon have shown potential for influencing the blood-brain barrier, but interferon-lambda may have significantly fewer side effects. Infections with West Nile virus occur globally. No treatments exist for the virus, which crosses the blood-brain barrier in an estimated 1 percent of infected people, causing a debilitating neurological condition that can be fatal. Klein and co-senior author Michael Diamond, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, looked closely at West Nile virus infections in mice to learn more about how viruses cross the blood-brain barrier. This barrier typically keeps large molecules, such as immune cells, drugs and pathogens, out of the brain while letting in essential nutrients such as glucose. In earlier research, Klein showed that West Nile virus can open the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system, but that the barrier usually quickly closes, preventing immune molecules from following to attack the virus. In the new study, the scientists studied mice that lacked the interferon-lambda receptor. Compared with normal mice, the mice without the receptor had higher levels of West Nile virus in the brain. The researchers found the blood-brain barrier was much more permeable to the virus in these mice, suggesting that loss of the receptor through which interferon-lambda acts had loosened the barrier. The scientists then gave normal mice West Nile virus along with interferon-lambda. The mice received the antiviral compound at the start of the infection and two and four days later. Typically less than 20 percent of normal mice survive such a high dose of the virus, but survival rates rose to more than 40 percent after treatment with interferon-lambda. ""Viruses are most dangerous when they enter the brain,"" said Diamond. ""Compared with untreated mice, we found significantly lower concentrations of the virus in the brain among mice treated with interferon-lambda."" If further studies of interferon-lambda prove fruitful in stemming the spread of viruses to the brain, a major hurdle remains. By the time symptoms of viral infections are serious, the virus is already in the brain. This reality suggests earlier diagnosis is critical. But, the researchers note, interferon-lambda may be a better way to influence what gets into the brain than other forms of interferon, which are associated with significant side effects such as fever, chills and fatigue. ""Interferon-lambda has significantly fewer receptors in the body, which may mean using it as a treatment is likely to have fewer side effects,"" Diamond said. ""It's also possible that interferon-lambda may influence other protective barriers in the body, such as those in the skin and the gut, an area of research my laboratory is investigating.""

But when the insect flees the scene, is it doing so because it is actually afraid? Using fruit flies to study the basic components of emotion, a new California Institute of Technology (Caltech) study reports that a fly's response to a shadowy overhead stimulus might be analogous to a negative emotional state such as fear a finding that could one day help us understand the neural circuitry involved in human emotion. The study, which was done in the laboratory of David Anderson, Seymour Benzer Professor of Biology and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, is published online in the journal Current Biology. Insects are an important model for the study of emotion; although mice are closer to humans on the evolutionary family tree, the fruit fly has a much simpler neurological system that is easier to study. However, studying emotions in insects or any other animal can also be tricky. Because researchers know the experience of human emotion, they might anthropomorphize those of an insect just as you might assume that the shooed-away fly left your plate because it was afraid of your hand. But there are several problems with such an assumption, says postdoctoral scholar William T. Gibson, first author of the paper. ""There are two difficulties with taking your own experiences and then saying that maybe these are happening in a fly. First, a fly's brain is very different from yours, and second, a fly's evolutionary history is so different from yours that even if you could prove beyond any doubt that flies have emotions, those emotions probably wouldn't be the same ones that you have,"" he says. ""For these reasons, in our study, we wanted to take an objective approach."" Anderson and Gibson and their colleagues did this by deconstructing the idea of an emotion into basic building blocks so-called emotion primitives, a concept previously developed by Anderson and Ralph Adolphs, Bren Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience and professor of biology. ""There has been ongoing debate for decades about what 'emotion' means, and there is no generally accepted definition. In an article that Ralph Adolphs and I recently wrote, we put forth the view that emotions are a type of internal brain state with certain general properties that can exist independently of subjective, conscious feelings, which can only be studied in humans,"" Anderson says. ""That means we can study such brain states in animal models like flies or mice without worrying about whether they have 'feelings' or not. We use the behaviors that express those states as a readout."" Gibson explains by analogy that emotions can be broken down into these emotion primitives much as a secondary color, such as orange, can be separated into two primary colors, yellow and red. ""And if we can show that fruit flies display all of these separate but necessary primitives, we then may be able to make the argument that they also have an emotion, like fear."" The emotion primitives analyzed in the fly study can be understood in the context of a stimulus associated with human fear: the sound of a gunshot. If you hear a gun fire, the sound may trigger a negative feeling. This feeling, a primitive called valence, will probably cause you to behave differently for several minutes afterward. This is a primitive called persistence. Repeated exposure to the stimulus should also produce a greater emotional response a primitive called scalability; for example, the sound of 10 gunshots would make you more afraid than the sound of one shot. Gibson says that another primitive of fear is that it is generalized to different contexts, meaning that if you were eating lunch or were otherwise occupied when the gun fired, the fear would take over, distracting you from your lunch. Trans-situationality is another primitive that could cause you to produce the same fearful reaction in response to an unrelated stimulus such as the sound of a car backfiring. The researchers chose to study these five primitives by observing the insects in the presence of a fear-inducing stimulus. Because defensive behavioral responses to overhead visual threats are common in many animals, the researchers created an apparatus that would pass a dark paddle over the flies' habitat. The flies' movements were then tracked using a software program created in collaboration with Pietro Perona, the Allen E. Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering. The researchers analyzed the flies' responses to the stimulus and found that the insects displayed all of these emotion primitives. For example, responses were scalable: when the paddle passed overhead, the flies would either freeze, or jump away from the stimulus, or enter a state of elevated arousal, and each response increased with the number of times the stimulus was delivered. And when hungry flies were gathered around food, the stimulus would cause them to leave the food for several seconds and run around the arena until their state of elevated arousal decayed and they returned to the food exhibiting the primitives of context generalization and persistence. ""These experiments provide objective evidence that visual stimuli designed to mimic an overhead predator can induce a persistent and scalable internal state of defensive arousal in flies, which can influence their subsequent behavior for minutes after the threat has passed,"" Anderson says. ""For us, that's a big step beyond just casually intuiting that a fly fleeing a visual threat must be 'afraid,' based on our anthropomorphic assumptions. It suggests that the flies' response to the threat is richer and more complicated than a robotic-like avoidance reflex."" In the future, the researchers say that they plan to combine the new technique with genetically based techniques and imaging of brain activity to identify the neural circuitry that underlies these defensive behaviors. Their end goal is to identify specific populations of neurons in the fruit fly brain that are necessary for emotion primitives and whether these functions are conserved in higher organisms, such as mice or even humans. Although the presence of these primitives suggests that the flies might be reacting to the stimulus based on some kind of emotion, the researchers are quick to point out that this new information does not prove nor did it set out to establish that flies can experience fear, or happiness, or anger, or any other feelings. ""Our work can get at questions about mechanism and questions about the functional properties of emotion states, but we cannot get at the question of whether or not flies have feelings,"" Gibson says.

In studying how airplane noise affects the palate, Cornell food scientists have found sweetness suppressed and a tasty, tender tomato surprise: umami. A Japanese scientific term, umami describes the sweet, savory taste of amino acids such as glutamate in foods like tomato juice, and according to the new study, in noisy situations   like the 85 decibels aboard a jetliner   umami-rich foods become your taste bud s best buds.  Our study confirmed that in an environment of loud noise, our sense of taste is compromised. Interestingly, this was specific to sweet and umami tastes, with sweet taste inhibited and umami taste significantly enhanced,  said Robin Dando, assistant professor of food science.  The multisensory properties of the environment where we consume our food can alter our perception of the foods we eat.  With Dando, Kimberly Yan, MPS  14, co-authored the study,  A Crossmodal Role for Audition in Taste Perception,  published online in March in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance. The research will appear in a forthcoming print edition of the journal. The study may guide reconfiguration of airline food menus to match these loud environments   in other words, make airline food taste better. Auditory conditions in air travel actually may enhance this sought-after taste, the researchers found. In contrast, in sweet taste ratings, exposure to the loud noise condition resulted in a pronounced suppression of taste intensity   the sweet sense was dulled. Airlines acknowledge the phenomenon. German airline Lufthansa had noticed that passengers were consuming as much tomato juice as beer. The airline commissioned a private study released last fall that showed cabin pressure enhanced tomato juice taste. Taste perception depends not only on the integration of several sensory inputs associated with the food or drink itself, but also on the sensory attributes of the environment in which the food is consumed, the scientists say. Said Dando:  The multisensory nature of what we consider  flavor  is undoubtedly underpinned by complex central and peripheral interactions. Our results characterize a novel sensory interaction, with intriguing implications for the effect of the environment in which we consume food. ","Published: May 15, 2015"

Agricultural economist Andrew Barkley, who has studied wheat for nearly 30 years, said that the team s major finding is that heat appears to be more damaging to wheat yields than freezing temperatures.  There s a lot of evidence to suggest that temperatures will increase in the future,  Barkley said.  What we ve done here is estimate the impact of what might happen to wheat yields if temperatures increase in Kansas.  In Kansas, the country s most productive wheat-growing state, farmers plant winter wheat in the fall and harvest it in late spring and early summer. The nine-month growing season makes the crop susceptible to many temperature swings. If temperatures continue to rise, as climate patterns currently suggest, wheat yields may be damaged in the spring when flowering and grain filling occur.  In Kansas, wheat is extremely important economically; crops are worth up to $3 billion per year just in Kansas, and we produce about 15 percent of the wheat that is grown in the U.S.,  Barkley said.  So we re interested in wheat for several reasons, but with climate change, we re concerned about the potential impact of that on wheat in the future.  Barkley added that more recently released varieties of wheat   which are normally higher yielding   are less heat resistant than older varieties. For farmers, it could force a decision about using those pest- or disease-resistant varieties and accepting the risk of losing yield to high spring temperatures.  Our research points to developing genetic strategies to identify the exact genes and DNA that will help us change the wheat plant so that it can accommodate for heat,  Barkley said.  At this time, the [Kansas State] agronomy department is working on that exact thing.  From 1985 to 2013, breakthroughs in wheat breeding helped Kansas farmers improve their yields by 27 percent, according to Barkley.  We ve had huge success in increasing the amount of food we get from each acre in Kansas,  he said. Knowing that rising temperatures threaten that success, though, is  good news, in a way,  Barkley noted.  As we progress, we are going to be able to deal with these changes in temperature as they arise. Climate change is a slow process, and wheat breeding also is relatively slow, but there s been major advances in wheat breeding, so that we can change the average time it takes to develop a new variety from over 10 years to about half that time. We really have a positive forecast of changing these wheat varieties to accommodate for the heat.  The study is published in the May 11 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Other researchers on the team include Jesse Tack of Mississippi State University and Lawton Lanier Nalley of the University of Arkansas.","Published: May 15, 2015"

At the heart of soft materials, governing their overall properties and capabilities, are the interactions of nano-sized components. Observing the dynamics behind these interactions is critical to understanding key biological processes, such as protein crystallization and metabolism, and could help accelerate the development of important new technologies, such as artificial photosynthesis or high-efficiency photovoltaic cells. Observing these dynamics at sufficient resolution has been a major challenge, but this challenge is now being met with a new non-invasive nanoscale imaging technique that goes by the acronym of CLAIRE. CLAIRE stands for  cathodoluminescence activated imaging by resonant energy transfer.  Invented by researchers with the U.S. Dept. of Energy s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Univ. of California Berkeley, CLAIRE extends the incredible resolution of electron microscopy to the dynamic imaging of soft matter.  Traditional electron microscopy damages soft materials and has therefore mainly been used to provide topographical or compositional information about robust inorganic solids or fixed sections of biological specimens,  says chemist Naomi Ginsberg, who leads CLAIRE s development.  CLAIRE allows us to convert electron microscopy into a new non-invasive imaging modality for studying soft materials and providing spectrally specific information about them on the nanoscale.   Scanning electron microscopes use beams of electrons rather than light for illumination and magnification. With much shorter wavelengths than photons of visible light, electron beams can be used to observe objects hundreds of times smaller than those that can be resolved with an optical microscope. However, these electron beams destroy most forms of soft matter and are incapable of spectrally specific molecular excitation. Ginsberg and her colleagues get around these problems by employing a process called  cathodoluminescence,  in which an ultrathin scintillating film, about 20 nm thick, composed of cerium-doped yttrium aluminum perovskite, is inserted between the electron beam and the sample. When the scintillating film is excited by a low-energy electron beam (about 1 KeV), it emits energy that is transferred to the sample, causing the sample to radiate. This luminescence is recorded and correlated to the electron beam position to form an image that is not restricted by the optical diffraction limit. While there is still more work to do to make CLAIRE widely accessible, Ginsberg and her group are moving forward with further refinements for several specific applications.  We re interested in non-invasively imaging soft functional materials like the active layers in solar cells and light-emitting devices,  she says.  It is especially true in organics and organic/inorganic hybrids that the morphology of these materials is complex and requires nanoscale resolution to correlate morphological features to functions.  Ginsberg and her group are also working on the creation of liquid cells for observing biomolecular interactions under physiological conditions. Since electron microscopes can only operate in a high vacuum, as molecules in the air disrupt the electron beam, and since liquids evaporate in high vacuum, aqueous samples must either be freeze-dried or hermetically sealed in special cells.  We need liquid cells for CLAIRE to study the dynamic organization of light-harvesting proteins in photosynthetic membranes,  Ginsberg says.  We should also be able to perform other studies in membrane biophysics to see how molecules diffuse in complex environments, and we d like to be able to study molecular recognition at the single molecule level.

It is urine, not blood, that is analysed in the MAP Test and this means it can be delivered globally on a mass scale to women who don t necessarily have access to hospital facilities.  Professor Howard Cuckle, Adjunct Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Columbia University, New York is an expert in antenatal screening and was one of the pioneers of screening for Down s syndrome:  This could be a major turning point in antenatal screening which I am very excited about. The MAP Test is much cheaper than current screening in many countries and vastly cheaper than the other new technique, cell free DNA (cfDNA). If the reliability indicated in early studies is borne out in ongoing studies over the next few months then this is a completely disruptive technology. Its beauty lies in its simplicity.  The great innovation in MAP Diagnostics' newly patented test lies in its 'on-the-fly', instant result screening of urine for patterns of protein biomarkers that occur only in a Down's pregnancy from around eight weeks' gestation. This contrasts with the current ""combined test"" where blood samples are taken at around 12 weeks and considered alongside ultrasound scans and other factors such as mother's age. The savings in terms of reduced appointments (for blood taking, scans and presenting results) along with the relatively affordable equipment required to run the screen stand to save the NHS and other healthcare providers many millions of pounds annually. MAP Diagnostics  test uses matrix assisted time of flight mass spectrometry or MALDI ToF MS to produce a barcode pattern of proteins present in a microscopic sample of urine. The mass spectrometers, costing from around 50 thousand pounds, could soon become a standard piece of kit in every hospital laboratory. The expertise at MAP Diagnostics lies in interpreting these vastly detailed barcode patterns and utilising mathematical algorithms to rapidly produce near perfect screening and diagnostic results. The development will arguably have its greatest impact on the global stage where many women don't have access to sophisticated healthcare provision yet will be able to post urine to labs for rapid and reliable results. Dr Stephen Butler, Chief Scientific Officer at MAP Diagnostics and co-author of this research said:  Our tests are about making sophisticated technologies accessible and affordable to couples when then need them most. This will offer choice to women, and their partners, much earlier in pregnancy to enable difficult decisions to be made with confidence and without any additional pressures of time.  Professor Ray Iles, COO at MAP Diagnostics and lead author of the study said:  This MAP test for Down s syndrome is the result of a lifetime s work. Our latest research has a greater than 90% detection rate and on this basis, we re continuing to attract further investment to bring the test to as many women around the world within the coming months. We understand the anxiety every parent faces not knowing whether their baby will be affected by this serious disability and this has driven us to persist with our research. We expect that the NHS and other healthcare providers will jump at the chance to improve the accuracy, timing and cost of screening for this genetic disorder. ","Published: May 15, 2015"

The study also developed a predictive model with potential clinical importance for measuring healthy development of bacteria in the gut of young children.  Antibiotics are by far the most common prescription drugs given to children. They account for about one-fourth of all medications prescribed to children, with a third of these prescriptions considered unnecessary. Other studies have shown profound short- and long-term effects of antibiotics on the diversity and composition of the bacteria in our bodies, called our microbiome.  Diseases related to metabolism and the immune system are increasing dramatically, and in many cases we don t know why,  said the study s senior author Dan Knights, a computational biologist and assistant professor in the Univ. of Minnesota s Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering and Biotechnology Institute.  Previous studies showed links between antibiotic use and unbalanced gut bacteria, and others showed links between unbalanced gut bacteria and adult disease. Over the past year we synthesized hundreds of studies and found evidence of strong correlations between antibiotic use, changes in gut bacteria, and disease in adulthood.  Knights and his colleagues developed a framework to map how antibiotics may be acting in the gut to cause disease later in life.  In the case of allergies, for example, the use of antibiotics may eradicate key gut bacteria that help immune cells mature. These cells would have been essential for keeping the immune system at bay when confronted with allergens. Even if these bacteria return, the immune system remains impaired. Related to obesity, antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota resulted in increased levels of short-chain fatty acids that affect metabolism. The study also examined the development of bacteria in the gut. Researchers demonstrated that an infant s age could be predicted within 1.3 months based on the maturity of their gut bacteria. This finding could lead to a clinical test and interventions for children whose microbiome is developmentally delayed due to antibiotics or other factors.  We think these findings help develop a roadmap for future research to determine the health consequences of antibiotic use and for recommendations for prescribing them,  Knights said.  The clinical test we demonstrated would also allow us to think about interventions at an early age. ","Published: May 15, 2015"

Professor Marina Bloj, Professor of Visual Perception within the Bradford School of Optometry and Vision Sciences at the University of Bradford, said:  When the dress saga started I was visiting my colleagues in Germany to develop some new color vision experiments and we had an ideal opportunity to use the set-up to do some rigorous studies on this polemical image.  The confusion would have never occurred if it was not for the special colors present in the photograph, it would not have happened with other colored dresses. The bluish and yellow coloring in the image correspond to colors that we experience naturally during the course of the day, they lay on what is known as the daylight locus.  We can normally discount this illumination effect, but the in the case of #TheDress not enough information is available in the photograph so different people make unconsciously different assumptions and as a result perceive the dress differently. Some see it as a blue dress under warm light, others as a white dress under cool illumination. As part of the experiment the team adjusted the color of a disc to correspond to the colors the participants saw in the photograph. Participants reported seeing a continuous range of shades from light blue to dark blue, rather than the two dominant colors reported so far - white and blue.  The question should thus not be whether the dress is blue or white, but whether it is light blue or dark blue,  says Prof. Dr. Karl Gegenfurtner, department of psychology at Justus Liebig University Giessen (JLU).  Despite the continuous choice of matching colors, observers are consistent in calling the dress  white  when their match lies above a certain brightness and  blue  when it lies below.  The team discovered that all test subjects basically perceived similar color shades, only varying in lightness. These perceived colors have something in common, they all are part of the so-called daylight locus; depending on the position of the sun during the course of the day, daylight tends to be rather bluish (at noon) or rather yellowish (in the morning and in the evening).  Marina said:  Usually, people are able to unconsciously filter the effect of bluish or yellowish light with the result that everyone perceives the same colors. To do so, we require reference points, otherwise known as colors, which are located outside the daylight locus. However these colors (generally red or green) are completely missing in the case of #TheDress. Therefore, the photograph does not provide relevant information on the scene s luminance levels.  Various studies have proven that people have difficulties perceiving colors along the daylight locus correctly. Test subjects are for instance rarely able to set a completely neutral grey on the screen without tending to a slightly bluish or yellowish tinge. Deviations concerning red or green tendencies on the contrary hardly ever occur, which, in turn, explains why a red and green coloring of the dress on a screen would look the same color to participants.

A team lead by Arlette Kolta, a professor at the University of Montreal's Faculty of Dentistry, has shown that astrocytes play a key role. Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells in our brain. Glial cells are not neurons   they play a supporting role. The team's finding in fact challenges some of the beliefs scientists have about the way our brain works. The brain contains billions of cells and every brain function depends on the ability of neurons to communicate with each other. Neurons use an electrical language to communicate and the pattern of their electrical activity encodes the essence of the message that they convey to the next neuron.  In the neuron-centric vision that dominates at the moment, changes in the pattern of neuronal electrical activity depend solely on the intrinsic properties of neurons and on the information they transmit to one another. Our results demonstrate that glial cells play a crucial role controlling the pattern of neuronal electrical activity and thereby neuronal functions,  Kolta said. By using different methods to measure the electrical activity of neurons in the trigeminal system which enables sensation in the face and facial motor functions, the researchers were able to look at how the brain processes chewing.  We discovered a mechanism by which astrocytes regulate the extracellular concentration of calcium in this sensory-motor circuit, and by doing this, determine the pattern of electrical activity of surrounding neurons. We think that the trigeminal neurons that we investigate have a dual function depending on the pattern of their electrical activity which can be either tonic or bursting,  explained Philippe Morquette, first author of the study. Tonic is like the hum when you pick up the phone, a continuous and permanent connection to the different parts of the system, while bursting is like the ringing you hear when you finish dialing. . When neurons are in the tonic mode, they faithfully relay to other neurons information that they receive from sensory afferents. Sensory afferents are the means by which the brain and nervous system receive signals from the bodily senses. When they are in the rhythmic bursting mode they generate a rhythmic motor command, like the one needed to produce a repetitive movement such as chewing.  The rhythmic bursting mode depends on activation of a current that is modulated by the extracellular concentration of calcium. We show that astrocytes are responsible for the switch from one mode to the other, and thus presumably from one function to the other. The switch cannot occur when astrocytes are  inactivated' or when the described astrocytic mechanism is blocked. This mechanism relies on release of a specific calcium binding protein released by glial cells,  Morquette added. Published in Nature Neuroscience, the study is the first to show the role that astrocytes play in regulating the concentration of calcium outside of neurons, bolstering the idea that these cells play an important role in neural processing.  The mechanism for regulating calcium that we described may have far reaching implications given the number of neuronal functions that may be altered by changes in extracellular calcium concentration and by the ubiquitous distribution of S100-beta, the calcium binding protein involved,  Morquette explained. The importance of the findings is far greater than a better understanding of how we chew.  The mechanisms involved contribute to a wide variety of brain functions: they're at the basis of other vital and repetitive movements like locomotion and respiration, they're widespread in the cortex, hippocampus and other areas, and have been associated to many important functions such as attention and learning and memory. Finally, it is well known that astrocytes are over-activated in pathological situations associated with increased burst firing, like during seizures, and we believe that the mechanism described here is of particular relevance to those situations,  Kolta said.

The early exposure was also later apparent in the brain structure of the adult offspring. The timing of the exposure corresponds to the human gestational weeks 3-6 in terms of fetal development. In addition, the exposure to alcohol was found to cause similar changes to gene function in other tissues of the infant mice. These results suggest that alcohol causes permanent changes to gene regulation in the first cells of developing embryo. Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy may damage the child in many different ways, including learning disabilities as well as congenital deformities. The mechanisms through which alcohol impacts fetal development are not yet fully understood, and diagnosing the damage caused to the child is difficult. In the mouse model where the dam drinks alcohol in early pregnancy, the offspring exhibit symptoms similar to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in humans: decreased growth rate, similar structural changes to corresponding areas of the face and scull, and hyperactivity. The early exposure begins at conception and continues until the nervous system begins to develop. In humans, this corresponds to the first three or four weeks after conception in terms of development -- a period during which the mother-to-be is often unaware of being pregnant. Early pregnancy is an active time for cell division and differentiation. All the different cell types share a similar DNA strand, but in each of them a unique epigenome is formed to regulate their gene function. At this stage, the embryo is vulnerable to external influences, and any changes can spread extensively to different tissues as cells divide. The study, led by Dr. Nina Kaminen-Ahola, wanted to determine whether alcohol consumed in early pregnancy causes changes to the epigenome that regulates the embryo's genes. In addition, the researchers examined whether the potential changes would be seen later in the gene function and brain structure of the offspring. The research focused on the hippocampus, a brain structure important for memory and learning. It is known to be particularly sensitive to alcohol. In the study, early exposure to alcohol changed the epigenome as well as the function of several genes in the hippocampi of infant mice. Alcohol-induced changes were also seen in the brain structures of the adult offspring: the hippocampi, olfactory bulbs and cerebral ventricles. In addition to the hippocampus, alcohol caused similar changes to gene function in two different tissues of the infant mice -- bone marrow and the olfactory epithelium of the snout. ""The results support our assumption that alcohol permanently alters gene regulation at a very early stage,"" states researcher Nina Kaminen-Ahola. ""This would be significant for the challenging diagnostics of alcohol-induced damage. The mechanisms and biological markers which can aid in diagnosis are studied so that we can offer the developmental support necessitated by the damage as early as possible.

That's according to a new study published in Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. National benchmarks call for getting stroke patients from the door of the emergency room to injection with the clot-busting drug known as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, or IV tPA in 60 minutes or less because the sooner tPA is administered, the better the outcome. But before the drug can be administered, patients must receive either a CT or MRI scan, to determine whether they are suitable candidates for the drug treatment. While an MRI can provide more valuable diagnostic information, it takes longer than a CT scan. So, few hospitals in the country routinely use an MRI as first-line brain imaging for acute stroke patients. However, teams at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland., found that by analyzing and changing their work processes, they could reduce ""door-to-needle"" times from 93 to 55 minutes, a 40 percent difference and meet the benchmark of 60 minutes or less while using MRI for first-line brain imaging, according to the study's physicians. This research was supported by the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. ""Using MRI scans gives doctors valuable information to help make treatment decisions, including the location and size of the stroke if present, when it occurred, the extent of blood vessel blockage and amount of brain tissue at risk, new or old bleeding, and potentially the cause of the stroke,"" said Amie Hsia, MD, medical director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, and the study's senior author. ""We borrowed ideas from manufacturers who use 'lean' production processes to make their plants more efficient, and applied them to healthcare. Our colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis had previously applied these principles to the evaluation of stroke with CT, which inspired us to take a similar approach with MRI."" A critical factor in improving efficiency is teamwork among all the different areas involved in evaluating stroke patients, including emergency room physicians, nurses and technicians; radiology and laboratory staff; and acute stroke team physicians and nurses. ""We wanted to share with other hospitals exactly how we streamlined our processes so they could see what's possible, and consider applying similar interventions within their own institutions, to be able to use MRI scans when needed to quickly guide treatment decisions for patients with suspected stroke,"" added Dr. Hsia. Among the efficiency-improving steps taken by the hospitals were creating process maps to identify roadblocks causing delays, reorganizing the work flow to reduce handoffs, and assigning specific roles to each member of the stroke team. The study's authors concluded that by using these approaches, other hospitals could reduce their door-to-needle times as well, and begin using MRI scans. The time-saving techniques are known as SMART, or Screening with MRI for Accurate and Rapid stroke Treatment. In addition, according to Dr. Hsia, many of these interventions can also be applied to hospitals that primarily use screening CT scans, because they affect the processes before and after the brain scan rather than the imaging itself.

The study compared a group of 1,021 pregnant women who took antipsychotics during pregnancy to a group of 1,021 pregnant women of similar of age, income, mental health status and health care utilization who did not take antipsychotics. The researchers found: ""The maternal and perinatal medical risks associated with antipsychotic drug use itself during pregnancy appear to be minimal,"" said Dr. Vigod. ""Ultimately, our results support better-informed decision making for women managing mental illness."" The researchers add that there is an ongoing need to carefully assess and monitor pregnant women who are dealing with mental illness. ""Our results are reassuring for women who require antipsychotic medication to maintain their mental health stability during pregnancy, at least with respect to short term maternal and infant outcomes,"" she added. ""Research into longer term child outcomes will be needed to provide a full picture of the long term impact of antipsychotic exposure in a developing fetus.""

While examining how airplane noise affects the palate, Cornell University food scientists found sweetness suppressed and a tasty, tender tomato surprise: umami. A Japanese scientific term, umami describes the sweet, savory taste of amino acids such as glutamate in foods like tomato juice, and according to the new study, in noisy situations   like the 85 decibels aboard a jetliner   umami-rich foods become your taste bud s best buds.  Our study confirmed that in an environment of loud noise, our sense of taste is compromised. Interestingly, this was specific to sweet and umami tastes, with sweet taste inhibited and umami taste significantly enhanced,  said Robin Dando, assistant professor of food science.  The multisensory properties of the environment where we consume our food can alter our perception of the foods we eat.  With Dando, Kimberly Yan, co-authored the study,  A Crossmodal Role for Audition in Taste Perception,  published online in March in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance. The research will appear in a forthcoming print edition of the journal. The study may guide reconfiguration of airline food menus to make airline food taste better. Auditory conditions in air travel actually may enhance umami, the researchers found. In contrast, exposure to the loud noise condition dulled sweet taste ratings. Airlines acknowledge the phenomenon. German airline Lufthansa had noticed that passengers were consuming as much tomato juice as beer. The airline commissioned a private study released last fall that showed cabin pressure enhanced tomato juice taste. Taste perception depends not only on the integration of several sensory inputs associated with the food or drink itself, but also on the sensory attributes of the environment in which the food is consumed, the scientists say.  The multisensory nature of what we consider  flavor  is undoubtedly underpinned by complex central and peripheral interactions,  said Dando.  Our results characterize a novel sensory interaction, with intriguing implications for the effect of the environment in which we consume food.

The most effective cancer drugs today may kill cancer cells, but they also kill healthy cells, causing severe side effects for patients in the process. Femtosecond time-resolved laser spectroscopy is a technique traditionally applied to study chemical reactions as they occur on a molecular level. The laser takes a series of rapid ""snapshots"" of molecules as they interact and change structure over time. The technique is part of a potential new field of science developed by Professor Lu called femtomedicine (FMD), which integrats the ultrafast laser with molecular biology and cell biology. Professor Lu has applied the tool to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer at the very moment when the DNA becomes damaged. He has also used it to investigate how radiation therapy and chemotherapy using chemical agents, in particular the widely used platinum chemotherapeutic Cisplatin, work in treating a variety of cancers. ""We know DNA damage is the initial step,"" said Professor Lu. ""With the novel femtomedicine approach we can go back to the very beginning to find out what causes DNA damage in the first place, then mutation, and then cancer."" By understanding more about the fundamental mechanisms of the diseases, Professor Lu pre-selected molecules most likely to be effective as anti-cancer agents. In this case, he discovered a new family of non-platinum-based molecules similar in structure to Cisplatin but containing no toxic platinum. Pre-clinical studies with various cultured human cells as well as on rodents show that these new molecules are effective against cervical, breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. Cisplatin, discovered more than 40 years ago, is an important, widely used platinum-based anti-cancer agent. Unfortunately, the inclusion of platinum in the molecule causes serious side effects like neurotoxicity, kidney damage, hearing loss, nausea and vomiting. ""It is extremely rare to discover anti-cancer agents that can selectively kill cancer cells and protect healthy cells, as well as being effective in treating many different types of cancer and having a novel molecular mechanism of action. These candidate drugs should have a high potential to pass through clinical trials and could ultimately save lives"", said Professor Lu. Professor Lu has already applied for patents on the new family of non-platinum-based-halogenated molecules that he has discovered and hopes to start clinical trials soon.","Published: May 14, 2015"

Invitae went public in February, netting $116 million in total gross proceeds. Invitae's net loss for the first quarter was $18.6 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to $9.0 million, or $12.06 per share, in Q1 2014. Invitae used about 17.1 million shares to calculate net loss in the first quarter compared to 749,048 shares in the year-ago period. The average analysts' estimate was a loss per share of $.51. Its R&D spending rose 70 percent to $8.5 million from $5.0 million in the year-ago period. SG&A costs also grew during the quarter to $8.1 million from $3.6 million. During the quarter, Invitae focused on launching new gene testing. In this regard, the firm expanded its test catalog to include four new cancer-related genes, including full sequencing of CHEK2, a gene associated with increased cancer risk. The company also introduced a new hereditary high-risk gynecologic panel. ""We are well on our way toward our 2015 goal of expanding our content to over 500 genes, and in turn, to reach our goal of offering 1,000 clinically reported genes for less than $1,000 in 2016,"" Invitae COO Sean George said during a call with investors to discuss earnings. Invitae ended the quarter with $68.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, the company announced new pricing schemes that will become effective as of June 1 for all its tests offerings. For third party payors where Invitae is out of network, the tests will be priced at $1,500 per indication. Institutions and payors with which Invitae has contracts and which bring Invitae in network, the price per test indication will be $950. Patients whose doctors have ordered tests online and who have decided to pay out of pocket will pay $475. Invitae's new pricing strategy, particularly the first two pricing points, is aimed at diversifying the payor mix and giving customers an incentive to move to institutional pay. The $475 price point is aimed at bringing in patients for whom doctors have a clear medical reason for testing, but whose insurance policies don't cover the test. The $475 patient price point is also in response to competition, Invitae CEO Randy Scott acknowledged. In April, genetic testing firm Color Genomics launched with a clinical-grade, comprehensive genetic sequencing test for breast and ovarian cancer risk that analyzes 19 genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, with a $249 price tag. ""Opening up the patient pay market, I think absolutely we're responding to competitive pressures that we're actually quite excited about,"" Scott said. ""This is the direction the market is going."" According to Invitae Chief Commercial Officer Lisa Alderson, more than 170 new institutions ordered tests during the quarter, and the company now has ordering accounts with around 60 percent of National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers. Test requisitions mostly come from genetic counselors and geneticists, currently the company's primary target market. According to Alderson the company is ahead of where it thought it would be in terms of reimbursement. The new pricing structure ""will help to access new markets"" and ""should increase reimbursement and cash collection,"" she said during the call. The company currently has contracts with four private payors, including BlueShield of California, SelectHealth, Capital Health Plan of Florida, and Ohio State Health Plan.

The authors said this could pose a risk to coastal, marine and freshwater environments. The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, is the first to show that the nanomaterials work as chemosensitizers. In cancer treatments, a chemosensitizer makes tumor cells more sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy. Similarly, nanozinc and nanocopper made developing sea urchin embryos more sensitive to other chemicals, blocking transporters that would otherwise defend them by pumping toxins out of cells. Stop being defensive: Nanozinc and nanocopper Nanozinc oxide is used as an additive in cosmetics such as sunscreens, toothpastes and beauty products. Nanocopper oxide is often used for electronics and technology, but also for antifouling paints, which prevent things like barnacles and mussels from attaching to boats.  At low levels, both of these nanomaterials are nontoxic,  said co-author Gary Cherr, professor and interim director of the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory, and an affiliate of the UC Davis Coastal Marine Sciences Institute.  However, for sea urchins in sensitive life stages, they disrupt the main defense mechanism that would otherwise protect them from environmental toxins.  Science for safe design Nanomaterials are tiny chemical substances measured in nanometers, which are about 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Nano-sized particles can enter the body through the skin, ingestion, or inhalation. They are being rapidly introduced across the fields of electronics, medicine and technology, where they are being used to make energy efficient batteries, clean up oil spills, and fight cancer, among many other uses. However, relatively little is known about nanomaterials with respect to the environment and health. This research is part of the University of California Center for the Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology and supported by the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The hope is the science will try to stay abreast of the use of nanomaterials so there actually can be safe design,  Cherr said.  The nanotechnology industry wants to come up with designs that are practical but still safe for the environment and human health. The UC center is trying to help fine-tune this.

Even tiny amounts of this toxin in food lead to botulism, which is fatal in 10% of cases. Clostridia bacteria survive in the environment as resilient, heat-resistant spores, so stringent safety measures are put in place in food processing. These ensure that botulism outbreaks are very rare, but to maintain food safety we need to understand as much as possible about how these bacteria survive and grow. Scientists at the Institute of Food Research, which is strategically funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, have world-leading expertise in these bacteria, and have recently uncovered the genetic controls of spore germination in these bacteria. Now, in new research published in the journal Food Microbiology, they have visualised the structural changes spores undergo during germination.  Dr Jason Brunt worked with microscopist Kathryn Cross to produce images of the stages spores go through during germination. They examined Clostridium sporogenes, a close relative of Clostridium botulinum that although less dangerous, can cause significant food spoilage problems. Their images showed that the spores have an outer covering, called an exosporium, with an aperture at one end. Closer examination showed that this aperture aligned with a spot on the spore where it ruptures during germination, and that the newly formed cell emerges through these holes. This suggests that the spores have polarity that aligns the structures correctly.  We think that this polarity is genetically pre-determined in the dormant spore,  said Dr Jason Brunt.  Our long term aim is to formulate detailed strategies to interrupt these processes. This would be of great benefit to the food industry to help control these pathogenic and spoilage clostridia.

Within the HMP samples, the team saw microbiome signatures that could successfully differentiate between baseline samples from the individuals. And microbial signatures from the gut microbiome appeared to remain particularly stable and distinct, providing clues for re-identifying roughly 80 percent of the individuals months later. ""Although the potential for any data privacy concerns from purely microbial DNA is very low, it's important for researchers to know that such issues are theoretically possible,"" senior author Curtis Huttenhower, a biostatistics researcher affiliated with Harvard School of Public Health and the Broad Institute, said in a statement. ""Perhaps even more exciting are the implications of the study for microbial ecology, since it suggests our unique microbial residents are tuned to the environment of our body   our genetics, diet, and developmental history   in such a way that they stick with us and help to fend off less-friendly microbial invaders over time,"" Huttenhower added. Although human microbiomes from each body site tend to cluster together, past studies indicate that the microbial composition and gene content at these locations vary significantly from one person to the next. Consequently, it's long been suspected that microbial communities found at certain body sites might have forensic utility. In a study published in 2010, for example, investigators focused on bacterial community composition in swab samples from computer keyboards belonging to three different individuals to search for skin microbiome signatures with forensic potential. For the latest study, researchers delved into existing sequence data for several body sites to more fully flesh out the forensic potential of the human microbiome. Using a so-called hitting set-based algorithm, the team brought together operational taxonomic unit, species, marker gene, and microbial reference sequence data to search for stable and distinct features in samples collected at between six and 18 body sites for as many as 120 HMP participants over weeks or months. ""We applied insights from computing theory and microbial ecology to construct metagenomic codes from sets of individual-specific and maximally stable metagenomic features,"" the study authors explained. After tracking down microbiome markers that consistently differed between individuals tested at a given body site at one time point, for example, the investigators checked to see if the same participant-specific signature persisted at later sampling points and attempted to validate their findings using data for additional samples from the HMP and MetaHIT projects. Indeed, their results suggest that microbial features found at the first time point were stable enough to identify around 30 percent of the individuals at subsequent time points between 30 days and many months later, suggesting it may be possible to use microbial ""fingerprints"" to forensically distinguish between individuals. The gut microbiome appeared to show particular promise as an individual identifier, the researchers reported. There, they were able to successfully re-identify some 80 percent of individuals based on microbial signatures present up to a year after sampling individuals' first fecal samples. ""In addition to highlighting patterns of temporal variation in the ecology of the human microbiome, this work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome-based identifiability   a result with important ethical implications for microbiome study design,"" Huttenhower and colleagues concluded.","Published: May 14, 2015"

Changes induced in the natural microbial community structure by contaminants lasts long after the contaminants themselves have become undetectable,  says Terry Hazen, an internationally recognized authority on microbial ecology who led the research.  This means the DNA of these microbial communities can be used as a forensic tool for measuring anthropogenic effects on the environment.  For this study, the ENIGMA collaborators identified the most independent and interesting groundwater well clusters from 25 years of monitoring data collected at the Bear Creek watershed in Oak Ridge. This watershed was a crucial site for the early development of nuclear weapons under the Manhattan Project and harbors spectacular geochemical gradients. The collaborators then collected a large number of microbial DNA samples from the identified wells in combination with 28 other physical/chemical characteristics.  The wells we sampled typically contain a high number of particulates in the groundwater, thus causing the filters we collected DNA on to clog easily,  says Andrea Rocha, a post-doctoral associate in Hazen s research group, who spent three months collecting samples from the watershed.  We had to change our filters each time they clogged until we obtained our required four liters of groundwater. Sometimes this meant changing filters five to six times for one well.  Analysis of the DNA data from the collected groundwater samples was carried out via a technique called  supervised machine-learning,  which the ENIGMA team applied to high-throughput DNA sequencing data.  Because microbial communities continuously sense and respond to their environments, they form a ubiquitous environmental surveillance network that can be inexpensively digitized through DNA sequencing,  Hazen says.  Our idea was to determine whether and how information encoded in bacterial communities might be tapped to quantitatively characterize the environment.  While previous research demonstrated that specific proteins or whole bacterial cells could be used as biosensors to translate environmental signals into machine-readable data, the focus of the ENIGMA study was on the integration of information gathered from native bacterial communities containing billions of cells and encompassing thousands of taxonomic groups. With just the sequencing data from the 16S rRNA gene alone, the ENIGMA team was able to quantitatively produce  a rich catalogue of 26 geochemical features  from 93 groundwater wells with highly differing geochemistry characteristics. These features were then used to predict contamination. The accuracy for predicting uranium contamination of the groundwater was about 88%, and the accuracy for predicting nitrate contamination was about 73%.  Our work shows that knowing what bacteria are present allows us to infer something about the current or past chemistry of a site,  says Eric Alm, an MIT microbiologist and one of the principal investigators on this project.  The next big challenge will be to understand why different bacteria are associated with different environmental conditions.  As human populations continue to grow and the industrialization of developing nations continues to expand, the impact of human activity on the environment is only going to intensify. Measuring the causes and consequences of these impacts is a challenge that science must meet. The ENIGMA project demonstrates one path towards meeting this objective.  It takes an integrated team to tackle a large problem like this,  says Paul Adams, the SFA Laboratory Research Manager for ENIGMA.  The work with these natural microbial communities highlights what can be achieved through interdisciplinary research that harnesses ENIGMA s scientific expertise in field sampling, high throughput sequencing, and computational analysis.

With further advancements, this technology has the potential to resolve the shape of objects in flow as small as viruses, the researchers say. The new technique, described in the May 12 issue of Nature Communications, uses a device first developed by MIT s Scott Manalis and colleagues in 2007. That device, known as a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), measures particles  masses as they flow through a narrow channel. The original mass sensor consists of a fluid-filled microchannel etched in a tiny silicon cantilever that vibrates inside a vacuum cavity. As cells or particles flow through the channel, one at a time, their mass slightly alters the cantilever s vibration frequency. The masses of the particles can be calculated from that change in frequency. In this study, the researchers wanted to see if they could gain more information about a collection of particles, such as their individual sizes and relative positions.  With the previous system, when a single particle flows through we can measure its buoyant mass, but we don t get any information about whether it s a very small, dense particle, or maybe a large, not-so-dense particle. It could be a long filament, or spherical,  says grad student Nathan Cermak, one of the paper s lead authors. Postdoc Selim Olcum is also a lead author of the paper; Manalis, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in MIT s departments of Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, is the paper s senior author. Many frequencies To obtain information about the mass distribution, the researchers took advantage of the fact that each cantilever, much like a violin string, has many resonant frequencies at which it can vibrate. These frequencies are known as modes. The MIT team came up with a way to vibrate the cantilever in many different modes simultaneously, and to measure how each particle affects the vibration frequency of each mode at each point along the resonator. The cumulative sum of these effects allows the researchers to determine not only the mass, but also the position of each particle.  All these different modes react differently to the distribution of mass, so we can extract the changes in mode frequencies and use it to calculate where the mass is concentrated within the channel,  Olcum says. The particles flow along the entire cantilever in about 100 milliseconds, so a key advance that allowed the researchers to take rapid measurements at each point along the channel was the incorporation of a control system known as a phase-locked loop (PLL). This has an internal oscillator that adjusts its own frequency to correspond to the frequency of a resonator mode, which changes as particles flow through. Each vibration mode has its own PLL, which responds to any changes in the frequency. This allows the researchers to rapidly measure any changes caused by particles flowing through the channel. In this paper, the researchers tracked two particles as they flowed through a channel together, and showed they could distinguish the masses and positions of each particle as it flowed. Using four vibrational modes, the device can attain a resolution of about 150 nanometers. The researchers also calculated that if they could incorporate eight modes, they could improve the resolution to about 4 nanometers. High-resolution mass imaging This advance could help spur the development of a technique known as inertial imaging, which makes use of several vibration modes to image an object as it sits on a nanomechanical resonator. Inertial imaging could allow scientists to visualize very small particles, such as viruses or single molecules.  Multimode mass sensing has previously been limited to air or vacuum environments, where objects must be attached to the resonator. The ability to achieve this dynamically in flow opens up exciting possibilities,  Manalis says. The new MIT technology could enable very high-speed inertial imaging as cells flow through a channel.  The suspended nanochannel technology pioneered by the Manalis group is remarkable,  says Michael Roukes, a professor of physics, applied physics, and bioengineering at Caltech, who is pioneering the development of inertial imaging but was not part of this study.  Their application of our approach for simultaneous monitoring position and mass of the fluidic analytes opens up many new possibilities,  Roukes says.  Extension of their efforts to fully employ our recently developed method of inertial imaging will also permit characterizing the shape of analytes, in addition to their mass and position, as they flow through the nanochannels.  Manalis  lab is also using the new technique to study how cells  densities change as they pass through constrictions. This could help them to better understand how cancer cells behave mechanically as they metastasize, which requires squeezing through small spaces. They are also using the PLL approach to increase throughput by operating many cantilevers on a single chip.

We established that you can use a single small molecule to rescue essential function in not only aged brain tissue but aged muscle,  said co-author David Schaffer, director of the Berkeley Stem Cell Center and a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering.  That is good news, because if every tissue had a different molecular mechanism for aging, we wouldn t be able to have a single intervention that rescues the function of multiple tissues.  The drug interferes with the activity of a growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1), that Schaffer s UC Berkeley colleague Irina Conboy showed over the past 10 years depresses the ability of various types of stem cells to renew tissue.  Based on our earlier papers, the TGF-beta1 pathway seemed to be one of the main culprits in multi-tissue aging,  said Conboy, an associate professor of bioengineering.  That one protein, when upregulated, ages multiple stem cells in distinct organs, such as the brain, pancreas, heart and muscle. This is really the first demonstration that we can find a drug that makes the key TGF-beta1 pathway, which is elevated by aging, behave younger, thereby rejuvenating multiple organ systems.  Aging is ascribed, in part, to the failure of adult stem cells to generate replacements for damaged cells and thus repair the body s tissues. Researchers have shown that this decreased stem cell activity is largely a result of inhibitory chemicals in the environment around the stem cell, some of them dumped there by the immune system as a result of chronic, low-level inflammation that is also a hallmark of aging.","Published: May 14, 2015"

Some patients absorb or eliminate active substances quickly, while others do so more slowly. For a treatment to be effective, the amount of medicines prescribed needs to be customised. Too high of a dose can trigger adverse effects, while an insufficient dose will lack efficacy. But how can we know how much of the active ingredient of a medicine circulates in a patient? Aptamers, stars in the detection of medicines The first step consists of identifying the concentration of medicines in the body, which is not easy. At EPFL, researchers in Carlotta Guiducci's Lab - Swiss Up Engineering Chair (CLSE) have developed a rapid and low-cost method to produce DNA fragments called aptamers, which are effective at capturing medicinal drugs in a blood sample. Aptamers represent a promising and underexploited technique in the detection of medicines. They are robust and stable and better suited than antibodies, which are often too large to detect small molecules efficiently. There is one hitch, however: the production of aptamers is currently slow and expensive. Recently published on the cover of ACS Combinatorial Science, a new method will pave the way towards the easy selection of aptamers that do not yet exist and that could react with new kinds of medicine. ""As of today, aptamers are selected by a small number of specialised laboratories, and they only fit for a limited number of target molecules"", says Carlotta Guiducci, director of the CLSE.  Here's how it works. The researchers attach DNA fragments to magnetic beads. When the target molecule approaches, the most receptive fragments go off the bead and cling to the molecule. The best fragments are then purified, multiplied and tested again, in order to eventually select the top performer. Only a few cycles of selection were necessary to obtain an aptamer at least as effective as those produced via traditional methods.  New approach to drug quantification The researchers did not stop there. Working with the CHUV (the University Hospital of Lausanne), they tested their aptamers using their compact new optical detection method, featured in Analytical Chemistry. For their test, the researchers chose to detect an antibiotic called tobramycin, which is currently used for hospital treatment of some infections. ""We used blood samples of known tobramycin concentration, measured with the reference methods at CHUV. The goal was to check whether our aptamers, combined with this simple and inexpensive sensor, were accurate in measuring the level of the medicine,"" said Carlotta Guiducci. The sensor, which fits into the palm of the hand, is made up of an LED light, a microfluidic device and a CMOS video camera. Inside the microfluidic channel are gold nanoislands with aptamers attached. When the sample enters the tube, the target molecules cling to the aptamers, which modifies optical properties of the contact surface, making it possible to determine the concentration of the drug in the sample. ""The concentration of tobramycin that we determined using our method corresponded to the clinical requirements,"" says the researcher. ""All indications are that this method could also work for many other types of medicines."" Easy way to monitor medicines in the blood By virtue of these joint research projects, the researchers have come up with a fast, inexpensive and compact turnkey technique for detecting medicinal substances in accordance with clinical requirements. In parallel, computer tools to assist in the interpretation of these measurements are being developed. This will be of interest to doctors, who will be able to easily monitor the amount of medicines in their patients' blood, and to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Debiopharm International, whose laboratory ""Translational Laboratory"" is located on the EPFL campus, contributed to this research through a Swiss Commission for Technology and innovation (CTI) project. ""The companies would like to characterize active principles quickly and inexpensively during the drug development phases. They want to know how their products are absorbed and eliminated by the body, before bringing them to the market,"" says Carlotta Guiducci.","Published: May 14, 2015"

Now even spent coffee-grounds are gaining attention for being chock-full of these compounds, which have potential health benefits. In ACS  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, researchers explain how to extract antioxidants from the grounds. They then determined just how concentrated the antioxidants are. Mar a-Paz de Pe a and colleagues note that coffee   one of the most popular drinks in the world   is a rich source of a group of antioxidants called dietary phenolic compounds. Spent grounds, however, often end up in the trash. But recently, scientists have discovered that antioxidants aren t just in the brewed coffee; they re also in the used grounds. De Pe a wanted to figure out the total phenolic content in extracts from these leftovers. The researchers used three different methods to release antioxidants from spent grounds and found high levels of phenols in the extracts   sometimes at higher levels than in brewed coffee. Thus, they have the potential to serve as additives to enhance the potential health effects of other food products, the scientists conclude.","Published: May 14, 2015"

During the winter, immune system genes like IL-6 receptor and C-reactive protein are more highly expressed, they found, suggesting that these changes could be linked to seasonal fluctuations in disease. Researchers have long known, they added, that there are seasonal influences on a number of conditions, including cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders, and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. ""In some ways, it's obvious   it helps explain why so many diseases, from heart disease to mental illness, are much worse in the winter months   but no one had appreciated the extent to which this actually occurred,"" Todd said in a statement. The researchers hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory circadian transcription factor ARNTL likely exhibited a seasonal gene expression pattern, and to test this hypothesis, they assayed its expression and the expression of tens of thousands of other genes in 454 blood samples from 109 children from the German BABYDIET cohort using an Affymetrix GeneChip array. ARNTL mRNA levels, the researchers reported, peaked in the summer months and declined in the winter. The housekeeping genes B2M and GAPDH did not show seasonal variations, though some circadian clock-related genes did. Overall, Todd and his colleagues found that nearly a quarter of the genome, or 5,136 of the 22,822 genes they examined, exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations in expression. Some 2,311 genes had increased expression in the summer months   June, July, and August   while 2,826 genes were more highly expressed in the winter months   December, January, and February. While they broadly replicated their finding in two additional cohorts and in adipose tissue from another group, Todd and his colleagues noted that the Australians in their samples exhibited the opposite pattern. Their ARNTL mRNA levels were highest in December, January, and February, or the Southern Hemisphere summer. In addition, the effect was somewhat different in the Icelandic population, the researchers reported, and speculated that it could be due to the effect of long summer days in Iceland. In the non-Icelandic populations, the researchers found that the expression of these seasonal genes largely correlated with the expression of about a dozen genes that mark the various blood cells present in peripheral blood, and noted that the total number of white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils also shift seasonally as do the mean corpuscular volume and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin of erythrocytes. However, in an equatorial cohort of 4,200 healthy people in Gambia, the researchers found seasonal fluctuations in the number of total white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets, though not granulocytes. Further, the researchers noted that the seasonal patterns in the Gambian cohort differed from those observed in the UK cohort. In the Gambian cohort, the seasonally expressed cell types peaked during the rainy season   June through October   which is a time marked by increased infectious disease burden there, including of malaria, Todd and his colleagues added. Using the BABYDIET data, the researchers constructed modules of co-regulated seasonal mRNAs. The seven winter-expressed modules, they found, were enriched for genes involved in pro-inflammatory processes, as compared to the summer-expressed modules. For instance, B-cell receptor signaling, FcR-gamma-associated processes, lysosomes, chemokine signaling, and phagosomes were all strongly associated with winter-expressed modules. Meanwhile, RNA transport, RNA degradation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and splicesosome-related processes were more common among the summer-expressed modules. This suggests ""that a more inflammatory status of the immune system predominates in winter,"" the researchers said. In the winter, the human immune system appears to be primed to respond to any threat, the researchers said. This could be ""a direct consequence of our co-evolution with infectious organisms and increased inter-species competition during winter, especially as humans migrated out of Africa to colder, more seasonally pronounced latitudes,"" Todd and his colleagues added.","Published: May 14, 2015"

EDC-HD employs over 100 staff at its main facility in the country's economic hub and largest city, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and at its satellite lab in C n Th , an important trading gateway on the Mekong River Delta, where 40% of agricultural and 60% of fisheries output are produced. The company also has plans to invest in a new facility in Vietnam's leading technology park, the Saigon Hi-tech Park. Established in 2008 as a merger between the HCMC Center of Education and Chromatography Development, and the Hai Dang Scientific Service, EDC-HD has developed a reputation for high quality analytical services at short turnaround times, with a strong focus on R&D and innovation, and has become the preferred independent analytical service provider for a vast majority of the country's food producers and manufacturers. As the third largest rice exporter and one of the top 10 exporters of fish products in the world, and with agriculture forming 18.4% of its GDP, the food and feed sector is clearly an important component of Vietnam's economy. Furthermore, given the country's status as a top exporter of one of the region's staple food products (rice) and as it expands its share of global fish exports, the focus on safety all along the food supply chain is increasing. As the largest private laboratory in the market, EDC-HD is well-positioned to benefit from the expected growth in food testing. The acquisition therefore provides Eurofins entry into this attractive testing market, and a strong platform to roll-out a broader service offering. In return, EDC-HD will gain access to the complete infrastructure and capability of the Group, including its renowned competence in grains testing and the most comprehensive range of fish and aquacultural products testing services. This should allow the company to substantially expand the range of services it offers to both domestic producers and exporters, thereby accelerating its market share expansion.

In a paper published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, the researchers describe how they identified the drug target while studying the way in which the parasites Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis, and Plasmodium, which causes malaria, access vital nutrients from their host cells. Around one-third of the world s deadly infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis, are caused by pathogens that spend a large portion of their life inside specially built compartments within their host cells. These compartments, known as  parasitophorous vacuoles,  separate the host cytoplasm and the parasite by a membrane, and thereby protect the parasites from the host cell s defenses. They also provide an environment tailored to their needs, according to Dan Gold, a postdoc who led the research in the laboratory of Jeroen Saeij, the Robert A. Swanson Career Development Associate Professor of Life Sciences in MIT s Department of Biology. However, the membrane of these vacuoles also acts as a barrier between the parasite and the host cell. This makes it more difficult for the parasite to release proteins involved in the transformation of the host cell beyond the membrane in order to spread the disease, and for the pathogen to gain access to vital nutrients, Gold says.  Ultimately what defines a parasite is that they require certain key nutrients from their host,  he says.  So they have had to evolve ways to get around their own barriers, to gain access to these nutrients.  Previous research has shown that the vacuoles are selectively permeable to small molecules, allowing certain nutrients to pass through pores in the membrane. But until now, no one has been able to determine the molecular makeup of these pores, and how they are formed. Two new proteins When studying Toxoplasma, the researchers discovered two proteins secreted by the parasite, known as GRA17 and GRA23, which are responsible for forming these pores in the vacuole, Gold says. The researchers discovered the proteins  roles by accident, while investigating how the parasites are able to release their own proteins out into the host cell beyond the vacuole membrane after invasion. Similar research into how the related Plasmodium pathogen performs this trick had identified a so-called  protein export complex  that transports encoded proteins from the parasite into its host red blood cell, which transforms these red blood cells in a way that is vital to the spread of malaria.  The clinical symptoms of malaria are dependent on this process and this remodeling of the red blood cell that occurs,  Gold says. The researchers identified proteins secreted by Toxoplasma that appeared to be homologues, or of shared ancestry to, this protein export complex in Plasmodium. But when they stopped these proteins from functioning, they found it made no difference to the export of proteins from the parasite beyond the vacuole.  We were left wondering what GRA17 and GRA23 actually do, if they are not involved in protein export, and so we went back to look at this longstanding phenomenon of nutrient transport,  Gold says. When they added dyes to the host cell, and again knocked out the two proteins, the researchers found that it prevented the dyes flowing into the vacuole.  That was our first indication that these proteins actually have a role in small-molecule transfer,  he says. More significantly though, when the researchers expressed a Plasmodium export complex gene in the modified Toxoplasma, they found that the dyes were able to flow into the vacuole once again, suggesting that this small-molecule transport function had been restored.  All of this came together to strongly suggest that this protein that is involved in protein export in Plasmodium may also have an additional function in small-molecule transport,  Gold says. Limited effects Crucially, since these proteins are only found in the parasite phylum Apicomplexa, to which both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium belong, they could be used as a drug target against the diseases they cause, including malaria, he says.  This very strongly suggests that you could find small-molecule drugs to target these pores, which would be very damaging to these parasites, but likely wouldn t have any interaction with any human molecules,  he says.  So I think this is a really strong potential drug target for restricting the access of these parasites to a set of nutrients.  In addition to malaria, the technique could also be used to target the parasite Eimeria, which affects cattle and poultry, among other animals, and therefore has a huge economic cost, Gold says. This  very exciting  research elegantly identifies a molecular component of a pore in the vacuole that separates the growing Toxoplasma parasite from its host cell to help in the acquisition of nutrients, according to Manoj Duraisingh, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard School of Public Health who was not involved in the research.  Strikingly, this molecule is conserved for this function in the related and deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium, where it was intriguingly found to be a part of a complex required for the export of proteins for the transformation of the host red blood cell and the virulence of the parasite,  Duraisingh says.  This suggests that a virulence determinant in Plasmodium parasites was co-opted from a basic function of parasitism broadly conserved in apicomplexan parasites. ","Published: May 14, 2015"

To date, no companion diagnostic blood tests have been approved for use in asthma. Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott will develop and commercialise diagnostic tests to measure serum levels of the proteins periostin and DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), which have been identified as potential predictive biomarkers of up-regulated IL-13 in severe asthma. The tests will be developed in conjunction with AstraZeneca s Phase III trial of tralokinumab, a potential treatment for patients with severe, inadequately controlled asthma, developed by the company s biologics research and development arm, MedImmune. Periostin has been previously described as a potential biomarker for asthma1, and DPP4 is a novel and promising predictive biomarker identified by MedImmune. The tralokinumab Phase III programme will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tralokinumab in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations in adults and adolescents with severe, inadequately controlled asthma despite receiving inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting  2-agonist. The programme will also assess the effect of tralokinumab on lung function, patient-reported asthma symptoms and quality of life, as well as investigate whether serum periostin or DPP4 could identify patients who are most likely to benefit from tralokinumab. Bing Yao, Senior Vice President and Head of MedImmune s Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity Innovative Medicines Unit said:  This partnership with Abbott to develop companion diagnostics for tralokinumab is an important step in delivering on our ambition to bring innovative options for patients who continue to suffer with severe asthma. We anticipate that physicians will ultimately use these tests to better identify patients likely to benefit most from tralokinumab to bring their condition under control. We are on the cusp of a new era in personalised healthcare, one which will see great improvements for patients treated with respiratory medicines.

This is one of the largest such screens of its type to date and will drive understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these conditions and their complications. The analysis will also uncover which genetic traits are linked to better treatment outcomes. Under the collaboration, MHI will genotype up to 80,000 DNA samples from AstraZeneca s extensive biobank. The samples include both tissue and blood samples, which have been collected over a period of 12 years under informed consent from patients who have entered clinical trials to test cardiovascular or diabetes treatments. MHI s Beaulieu-Saucier Pharmacogenomics Centre will initially use an approach called genome-wide SNP analysis to identify regions of DNA that predispose to, or cause, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes or are associated with responses to treatments. They will then apply other technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, to carry out full gene sequencing of areas of interest to identify new genes associated with disease, with complications such as heart attacks, strokes, diabetic nephropathy or retinopathy, and with treatment outcomes in terms of responsiveness to medication. The knowledge gained from genotyping the samples will be applied to the development of new medicines tailored to treat subsets of patients with particular genetic profiles. The information will also enable a personalised healthcare approach to the use of existing treatments, which means using specific medicines to treat the patient populations that are most likely to respond. Currently, approximately 80% of AstraZeneca s pipeline benefits from a personalised healthcare approach. Ruth March, Vice President, Personalised Healthcare and Biomarkers at AstraZeneca said:  We re delighted to be working with the Montreal Heart Institute, which has the expertise and technological know-how to deliver this transformational programme which will unlock an unprecedented amount of genetic information about cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.

Furthermore, in a murine CNV model, intravitreal administration of ISTH0036 was able to significantly reduce (40%) the process of angiogenesis, as compared to saline- and control oligonucleotide-treated eyes. This observation may open up development opportunities beyond glaucoma. Also presented at the conference, two posters described the overall preclinical profile and the testing of ISTH0036 in which it successfully demonstrated excellent cellular uptake, potent TGF- 2 mRNA downregulation (target engagement) in cell-based assays and in relevant tissues of the eye. Long-lasting tissue distribution was consistent with the observed target engagement.  We have clearly demonstrated in these animal models that intraocular administration of ISTH0036 leads to biological responses consistent with the expected molecular mechanism of action and with observed efficient and long-lasting distribution in relevant eye tissues,  said Dr. Michel Janicot, Head of Preclinical Research and Development at Isarna.  These preclinical data support the compound s potential to protect glaucoma patients  vision and we hope to reproduce these results in our ongoing clinical evaluation of the compound. In addition, based on these data we see several other high medical need diseases that could potentially benefit from TGF- -targeted treatment.  Several diseases in ophthalmology have been linked to the modulation of TGF- , among them are glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, diabetic retinopathy and corneal diseases. TGF- 2 has specifically been identified as having a critical role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma affecting changes in the ocular outflow region that can lead to open-angle glaucoma and has been linked in addition to having a direct, toxic effect on the optic nerve head.","Published: May 14, 2015"

The study, published in Neuropsychopharmacology, showed greater connectivity among certain brain regions in people who successfully quit smoking compared to those who tried and failed. The researchers analyzed MRI scans of 85 people taken one month before they attempted to quit. All participants stopped smoking and the researchers tracked their progress for 10 weeks. Forty-one participants relapsed. Looking back at the brain scans of the 44 smokers who quit successfully, the researchers found they had something in common before they stopped smoking -- better synchrony (coordinated activity) between the insula, home to urges and cravings, and the somatosensory cortex, a part of the brain that is central to our sense of touch and motor control.  Simply put, the insula is sending messages to other parts of the brain that then make the decision to pick up a cigarette or not,  said Merideth Addicott, Ph.D., assistant professor at Duke and lead author of the study. The insula, a large region in the cerebral cortex, has been the subject of many smoking cessation studies that show this area of the brain is active when smokers are craving cigarettes, said Joseph McClernon, Ph.D., associate professor at Duke and the study s senior author. Other studies have found that smokers who suffer damage to the insula appear to spontaneously lose interest in smoking.  There s a general agreement in the field that the insula is a key structure with respect to smoking and that we need to develop cessation interventions that specifically modulate insula function,  McClernon said.  But in what ways do we modulate it, and in whom? Our data provides some evidence on both of those fronts, and suggests that targeting connectivity between insula and somatosensory cortex could be a good strategy.  Neurofeedback and transcranial magnetic stimulation, used to improve depression, are two treatments that modulate brain activity. With the findings in this study, researchers now have more information on where to further investigate, McClernon said.  We have provided a blueprint,  McClernon said.  If we can increase connectivity in smokers to look more like those who quit successfully, that would be a place to start. We also need more research to understand what it is exactly about greater connectivity between these regions that increases the odds of success.  Duke Medicine   press release Merideth A.

Researchers from Griffith University s National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED)   part of the new Menzies Health Institute Queensland (Australia)   have uncovered significant factors contributing to the pathology of this illness. The results reveal genetic changes in important receptors associated with immunological and cellular function and contribute to the development of this complex illness.  These findings have been achieved through a team effort involving researchers, patients, funding bodies, clinicians and the support of Griffith University and the Queensland Government,  say chief investigators Professor Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik and Professor Donald Staines. Co-researcher and consultant immunologist Professor Pete Smith said that important signalling mechanisms are disrupted as a result of these genetic changes involving the detection and response to threats.  These are primitive genes that are involved in many cellular signals in the brain, gut, cardiovascular and immune systems, as well as in the mediation of pain.

In an effort to understand why patients who appear virus free are afflicted with AIDS-related dementia and other illnesses, researchers have focused on disease-fighting cells, called macrophages and monocytes, as they traffic throughout the body and into the brain. But little has been known about the timing and dynamics behind these types of white blood cells as they invade the central nervous system during the initial stages of HIV infection or at the onset of AIDS. A new investigative approach in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys has yielded fresh clues that show the caustic interplay between macrophage and monocyte traffic in the central nervous system and the onset of HIV infection and the formation of brain lesions tied to neurological damage, according to a new report in the online edition of the American Journal of Pathology. Researchers from Boston College, the University of Florida and Tulane University Health Science Center report macrophages accumulate in different parts of the brain during different stages of initial infection, a finding that clarifies the spread of infection to the brain is a multi-layered and dynamic process. ""This type of approach allowed us to label macrophages in the perivascular space in the brain to identify macrophage and monocyte traffic to the brain in the early, mid and late stages of infection,"" said Boston College Professor of Biology Kenneth Williams, the senior author of the report. ""We now know what cells bring the virus to the brain and what cells contribute to neurological damage in the brain, as well as the timing of the entry of these cells and when the pathologic virus enters. These are two big questions researchers have had."" The researchers tagged monocytes, destined to enter the brain, in bone marrow with a biochemical marker known as BrdU and also used a series of different color dyes to label macrophages as they entered the central nervous system at different times in infection, including early, mid and terminal states. As infection progressed, the researchers found MAC387 macrophages accumulated in the meninges and choroid plexus in early-stage brain infection. Later on, MAC387 macrophages were found in perivascular spaces that surround arteries and veins in the brain, as well as at sites where brain lesions would form. Another macrophage, known as CD163 macrophages, was traced to perivascular space and brain lesions during the late stage, the team reports. Late in infection, the volume of macrophages entering the brain was nearly three times as great as during early-stage infection. ""An important question researchers have is what drives the pathology and the resulting damage in the brain?"" said Williams. ""Is it the virus itself or macrophage and monocyte cells? What we found is that these cells that arrive late with the development of AIDS have a 2.9-fold higher percentage of being infected with the virus. So there is a dramatic increase in the viral load as infection progresses that correlates to macrophage accumulation."" Turning their attention to lesion formation, the researchers discovered that greater than 80 percent of the macrophages found in the lesions were present in the brain prior to lesion formation. The surprising finding suggests the cells in the lesions migrated from non-lesion sites in the brain rather than from outside the brain. ""Brain lesions are central to understanding what causes AIDS-related dementia,"" said Williams. ""In early stages of infection, we could see two or three macrophages scattered along the vessel. By the late stage, when lesions appeared, there were 30 to 50 at the site. What we found is that a majority of the cells in the lesions were present in the brain at an early stage. So these macrophages are migrating from the brain to the lesion sites, which shows a complex and dynamic level of activity."" Boston College Brian T. Nowlin, Tricia H. Burdo, Cecily C.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-insights-male-bias-autism-283231,New insights into the male bias of autism Male toddlers with autism have significant structural differences in their brains compared to females with the condition  according to research published in the open access journal Molecular Autism  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Male toddlers with autism have significant structural differences in their brains compared to females with the condition, according to research published in the open access journal Molecular Autism. The journal is publishing a special series of articles looking at the links between sex/gender and autism, which reveal additional insights into the role of prenatal sex hormones and the 'female protective effect'. Autism spectrum conditions are more common in males than in females, with a 2 or 3:1 male to female bias in prevalence consistently found in studies. Why this is the case is still not fully understood. Guest editor Meng-Chuan Lai from the Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, UK, said: ""Autism has always been perceived as a condition that occurs more often in males, which means that females are usually underrepresented in research studies. This means there's a risk that the scientific and clinical literature provides a partial, male-based understanding of autism. ""But autism is clearly not a 'male condition'. Delineating the role that sex and gender play in the characteristics of autism, across multiple levels, may inform both our ability to identify the condition and lead to a greater understanding of its developmental psychology and biology."" Researchers from the MIND Institute at University of California, Davis, USA, found sex differences in children with autism when looking at the organization of fibers in the corpus callosum, the largest bundle of nerve fibers in the brain.2 The study included 139 three-to-five year olds with autism (112 male/27 female) and 82 typically developing children (53 male/29 female). Using MRI, the researchers studied the pattern of nerve fibers projecting from the corpus callosum to different regions of the brain. There were clear sex differences in the results. While both males and females with autism had alterations in regions of the corpus callosum connected to the frontal lobe, the pattern of alterations differed between the sexes. In particular, males with autism had smaller callosal regions connecting to the orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in emotional processing and reward-related decision-making. In contrast, females with autism had smaller callosal regions connecting to the anterior frontal cortex, which is involved in higher order 'executive function' such as planning. The study suggests that males and females with autism should be evaluated separately and not assumed to share the same pattern of atypical brain structure. The study also suggests that differences in the corpus callosum are established early in development, before three years of age. In another study, researchers from the George Washington University, USA, found sex differences in the levels of the gene 'RORA' in the brain. RORA regulates many genes linked to autism, including a gene that influences prenatal testosterone levels, a known risk factor for autism. The team showed that RORA protein levels are higher in the brains of typically developing females compared to typically developing males, providing females with a buffer against RORA deficiency. RORA deficiency has previously been proposed as one factor that may make males more vulnerable to autism. Two papers in this new thematic series of the journal shed light on the 'female protective effect' -- the theory that there is a mechanism protecting the developing female brain from autism. Researchers from University of California, Los Angeles, USA, investigated the risk of autism in males and females in over 1,000 families, and the rate at which autism re-occurred in siblings. The results demonstrated the expected higher rates of autism in males compared to females, but also showed a significantly greater risk of autism for siblings of females with autism, compared to siblings of males with autism. The researchers say this supports the 'female protective effect' hypothesis because females with autism carry greater genetic load predisposing them to develop the condition, compared to males. This could cause them to overcome the 'female protective effect', although this interpretation of their results awaits testing at the molecular level. This greater genetic predisposition may run in families and means that siblings of females with autism are more likely to present autism. A final study, led by University of California, San Francisco, Washington University in St Louis and Yale School of Medicine, USA, analyzed genetic data from over 4,500 families affected by autism. Their work found that no single gene is associated with the female protective effect. The authors conclude that the mechanism of this protection remains unknown, but that multiple genes could play a role. Joseph Buxbaum, Co-editor in Chief of the journal Molecular Autism, said: ""We are excited to be publishing such high quality, novel research on the important and previously neglected topic of the roles that sex and gender play in understanding autism."" Simon Baron-Cohen, Co-editor in Chief of the journal, added: ""A focus on sex and gender in autism research should help improve the clinical identification of females who may have autism that has gone undiagnosed. ""Research into this topic may also help us understand the complex mix of sex-linked genetic, hormonal, and social factors that contribute to individual differences in social and language development and flexible adaptation to change, as well as autism itself.""

It has no obvious physical cause, is poorly understood and difficult to diagnose, treat and manage. For years there was doubt among the medical profession whether fibromyalgia actually existed   except in the minds of patients. There's still no specific blood test, scan or x-ray that can confirm a diagnosis, although blood tests are often carried out to rule out other conditions. Now scientists at King s College London, funded by a three year grant of  171,000 from Arthritis Research UK, are hoping their latest research will lead to a reliable blood test to enable doctors to make a proper diagnosis. The research team will examine samples and measurements taken from 400 twin volunteers from the 13,000 Twins UK Bioresource, in which one twin has chronic widespread pain. The samples will be compared with the DNA of their healthy twin to establish differences and to try to identify biomarkers in the DNA associated with the condition. ""Currently there's no blood test for fibromyalgia, which makes diagnosis difficult,  explained lead researcher Dr Frances Williams.  And treatment is limited, and in many cases unsatisfactory. ""Our research will help patients in two ways. First it'll contribute to our understanding of how fibromyalgia   and other chronic pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome   develop, and point to pain pathways which we may not have suspected. ""Secondly, we hope it'll lead to identification of a biomarker which we could work into a blood test. ""As well as enabling the condition to be diagnosed more effectively, it could help to  stratify  patients into groups depending on disease severity, which will help in clinical trials of potential new treatments. It might even help us predict how the condition will progress.  Fibromyalgia is known to have genetic influences but there are many complicated steps between the genes which are responsible for fibromyalgia and the condition itself. The King s team hopes to explore these steps in more detail and shed light on the underlying biology of the condition. Specifically, this study will focus on identifying markers on the outside of DNA that are associated with the switching on or off certain genes. DNA  switching  is very important to health, as it prevents inappropriate processes from occurring in the body when they should not. The project aims to assess the profile of DNA markers in healthy and affected twins. If there's a difference between these marker profiles on certain DNA regions associated with chronic pain onset between twins, then this DNA marker could be used as an indicator for disease. Dr Natalie Carter, our head of research liaison, commented: ""Fibromyalgia is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat, partly because we know so little about why it occurs and how it progresses. ""Being able to diagnose it would be a major step forward, and understanding more about the influence of genetics will allow us to develop treatments specifically for people with fibromyalgia in the future.""","Published: May 13, 2015"

These alkaloids, found in various plant species used by healers in Nigeria to treat people with conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, have antipsychotic properties that have potential to improve mental disorder treatments. The current drugs used for schizophrenia effectively treat delusions and hallucinations but are only partially effective for cognitive impairment. Early experimental research of these new compounds in animal models shows promise in improving cognitive impairment, the Northwestern scientists said.  After billions of years of evolution, nature has given us a great starting point for generating new types of molecules that could end up being used as innovative drugs,  said Karl Scheidt, lead author of the paper.  We ve learned how to make these natural products in the lab and can now evaluate what are the most effective parts of these natural products for potential therapies.   The synthesis of these alkaloids, which we have now just achieved, was exceedingly difficult,  said Meltzer, second author of the paper and an attending physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  Karl Scheidt's expertise in the synthesis of natural products was crucial to the success of this project and is the first step in getting a new drug ready for clinical trials.  Traditional healers boil these special plants and produce an extract that they administer to people with symptoms of mental illness. However, this extract isn t pure, and it contains other compounds and materials that may not be beneficial to people with mental disorders.  Nature did not intend this plant to produce an antipsychotic drug on its own,  Meltzer said. Through an efficient and stereo-selective synthesis, Scheidt and his team created four separate but related natural products. Now a template exists to continue making these compounds as needed for future studies and ultimately for use in clinical drug trials.  We can make multi-gram quantities of any of the compounds we want,  Scheidt said.  We built the assembly line and are now uniquely positioned to explore their potential.  Meltzer is already using these compounds in animal studies in his lab to better understand how they affect brain biology and chemistry in the schizophrenia disease model. Early results from his lab show that the compounds may increase the ability of other antipsychotic drugs to improve cognitive impairment.","Published: May 13, 2015"

The chemical signal allows the stem cells to escape the same fate, University of Washington researchers report. The discovery may explain why many cancers return after initially responding to treatment and could lead to new, more effective cancer drugs, says Yalan Xing, a postdoctoral fellow in the UW Department of Biochemistry and lead author of the study. Most human tissues harbor adult stem cells. These cells regenerate endlessly and produce daughter cells that can mature into a wide variety of cell types. This makes it possible for our bodies to grow and to replace damaged or aging cells. Many cancers, however, harbor similar cells, called  tumor-initiating cells  or  cancer stem cells.  They, too, have can give rise to new tumor cells. Both cell types share another property: they often can survive radiation and chemotherapy. In the case of stem cells, this ability allows our bodies to recover from these treatments. In the case of tumor-initiating cells, however, this survival strategy makes it possible for tumors to resist treatment and return. To find out how these cells survive exposure to what should be lethal doses of radiation and chemotherapy, Yalan Xing and Hannele Ruohola-Baker, professor of biochemistry, associate director of the UW Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine and the senior author of the study, looked at adult stem cells in the fruit fly and the natural weeding of unneeded cells called apoptosis. Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is an orderly clean-up method that our bodies follow to eliminate cells that are damaged, aged or no longer needed. In the case of radiation exposure and chemotherapy, damage to a cell s DNA from these treatments triggers apoptosis and cell death. In their study, the researchers show that, after exposure to radiation, dying daughter cells release a protein, called Pvf1, which is like a human protein called angiopoietin and which binds to receptors on nearby mother stem cells, called Tie receptors. This protein-receptor binding causes the stem cells to produce a short piece of RNA, called microRNA bantam, that represses the generation of a key protein, called Hid/Diablo/Smac, needed to trigger apoptosis. The upshot is that while the stem cells, like their daughter cells, may have suffered severe DNA damage, with Hid production repressed, they are prevented from self-destructing.  Essentially, the children tell the mom to protect herself,  said Xing. Because they are prevented from immediately destroying themselves, the stem cells survive until it is time for them to reproduce and regenerate tissue. The  research team proposes that, as the stem cells get ready to reproduce, they activate a battery of mechanisms that repair damaged DNA. By blocking apoptosis, the dying daughter cells have enabled their mother stem cells to survive until they have best chance of  recovering from the treatment-induced DNA damage and of regenerating damaged tissue. This system makes evolutionary sense, Ruohola-Baker said. By protecting the mother stem cells, the martriarchs, the dying daughter cells preserve the only cell type that can regenerate the tissue, the adult stem cell.  There are very similar genes and proteins in human cancers that are likely playing the same role of protecting the tumor-initiating cells from destruction. As a result, the tumor-initiating cells survive and the cancers return. By targeting these factors, perhaps by blocking Tie receptors, it may be possible to block the protective signal from the daughter cells, and thereby allow programmed cell death to proceed in the mother stem cells and prevent cancer.","Published: May 13, 2015"

These require specific treatments, and if doctors know that a bug is resistant they can start therapy earlier, often leading to better outcomes.  Whole genome sequencing reveals the complete genetic (DNA) sequence of an Mtb sample, in many cases pinpointing drug resistance mutations so that appropriate treatments can be given. However, this process currently takes weeks because samples need to be grown in the laboratory before there is enough genetic material to measure. The new method, published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, allows scientists to enrich Mtb DNA directly from patient sputum samples. This means that the samples can be sequenced and analysed straight away, avoiding the need to spend weeks growing them in the lab. The work was done as a collaboration between the researchers at UCL, Oxford Gene Technology (OGT), CLC bio-Qiagen and the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, who are part of the European Union FP7-funded PATHSEEK consortium  Using the conventional methods, patients with resistant TB would need to wait for up to six weeks for antibiotic resistance testing,  says senior author Professor Judith Breuer.  In that time, they may be taking drugs that are suboptimal or suffer unnecessary and unpleasant treatment side effects. Our technique and the associated software could reduce testing for antimicrobial resistance to a few days, allowing doctors to give precise antimicrobial treatment earlier than is currently possible.  To extract Mtb from sputum samples, the researchers used probes made of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, engineered to bind to Mtb DNA. The method was tested on 34 routine samples taken from patients in London and Lithuania, where resistant Mtb strains are a significant problem. The sequencing results from sputum matched perfectly with those from the relevant cultured isolates.  As well as delivering personalised treatments to patients, the tests could also be used to precisely track the spread of TB,  explains co-lead author Dr Josephine Bryant.  With rapid sequencing available it would be possible to trace TB infections in communities, or to identify a few highly infectious people, sometimes called  super-spreaders . If public health officials can identify these individuals faster and stop them from spreading the disease, control and prevention of future outbreaks could be improved.  As part of the PATHSEEK project, the technique has also been applied to other infections including chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis, herpes, influenza A, norovirus and cytomegalovirus. Although a lot of infections can be treated with antimicrobials, resistance is a growing problem in the UK and globally. Diagnostic techniques that enable more precise treatments to be given earlier could help to combat drug resistance in a wide range of infections, not just TB. Dr John Anson, Executive Vice President R&D at OGT added:  It is a privilege to be involved with the PATHSEEK project which is yielding such fruitful results, and to play an active role in developing new techniques for the rapid detection and characterisation of such important diseases.

Imagine having a master catalog of such targets for all the major cancer types and subtypes. Scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) publish in Nature Biotechnology a method of compiling just such a catalog, using the revolutionary gene-editing technology called CRISPR. CRISPR enables biologists to manipulate the genetic material of cells with unprecedented precision and ease - letter by DNA letter. CSHL Assistant Professor Chris Vakoc, M.D., Ph.D., and Junwei Shi, a Ph.D. student investigator in his lab, have figured out how to harness CRISPR s elegant power to the task that preoccupies their lab and so many others across the world: finding binding pockets inside cancer cells that when blocked prevent the cells from proliferating and cause them to die. Several years ago Vakoc used the best available technologies to find one such binding pocket - on an obscure protein called BRD4 -- that when blocked with an existing drug called JQ1 dealt a crippling blow to cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an often fatal form of blood cancer. The drug is now in human clinical trials.  That experience got us thinking,  explains Vakoc,  Is there a way we can look at hundreds or thousands of proteins at a time in a given cancer cell type - proteins with druggable binding pockets -- and in a single experiment find more BRD4s?  The short answer is yes. Their paper provides a proof of principle of the method they have devised. In leukemia cells, the CRISPR-based method surveyed about 200 potential targets and successfully identified the six targets already known and validated by pharmaceutical scientists, most of which are at the focus of existing drug development efforts; and found an additional 19 targets never before recognized.  This is just a single demonstration,  says Vakoc.  More broadly, what we provide is a way to comprehensively identify specific vulnerabilities in cancer cells, across cancer types.  Fascinated with CRISPR, Ph.D. student Shi spent much of the last year devising a way to use it to rapidly and accurately identify the best leukemia drug targets. The concept is not difficult to explain. It begins with the notion that genes provide cells with the code to build proteins - the molecules that do all the work in cells and support the tissues of our bodily organs. Since completion of the full human genome sequence over a dozen years ago, scientists have been amassing databases that document or predict how specific stretches of DNA letters in the genome encode specific segments of proteins, called domains. Among the domains of greatest interest to drug developers are those that form pocket-like features on the surface of proteins that other molecules can fit into, as keys fit into locks. Drugs are keys that fit into binding-pocket locks, sometimes for the purpose of blocking access to the lock, and other times to initiate a cascade of signaling inside the cell.  My lab is focused on finding a small number of these binding pockets   ones whose function cancer cells are addicted to,  Vakoc says.  There are a vast number of pockets encoded in our genome; and many of them are present in the proteins found in leukemia cells. We now have a test that will tell you whether a particular pocket matters to a given cancer cell. Which pockets, if you block or disable them, will really hurt a cancer cell? Which ones does the cell rely on to live and prosper?  CRISPR is a wonderful tool of discovery, since it can be used to change the DNA letters that  spell out  particular binding pockets. If you want to know if a cancer cell depends upon a particular pocket, you mutate it   change its DNA code, causing the pocket to take on an unnatural shape. You mimic the action of an effective drug targeting that particular pocket. The technique worked precisely and powerfully in the leukemia cells used for demonstration purposes, reported in the paper published.  If you change the pocket so the protein is no longer functional and you find the cancer can t survive, then you have a good shot at a useful drug target. We can t tell if any particular pocket will lead to a fully effective drug; but this is a way to annotate every critical pocket in cancer cells.  Vakoc s lab is starting with the kinds of binding pockets that drug makers like to target   considered  druggable  for various technical reasons.  For entirely pragmatic reasons, our lab is prioritizing our search to the kinds of targets chemists like and are willing to design drugs against,  Vakoc says.  We want to have an impact on cancers in the near-term. We want to provide pharmaceutical companies the kind of targets that they have extensive experience figuring out how to hit. And it all comes back to the question: can we identify specific things that cancer cells need-and then deprive them of those things. CRISPR should bring us to the end-game of finding all of the critical pockets of vulnerability in cancer.

Typhoid is a key example of this, with multidrug resistant strains of the bacterium Salmonella Typhi becoming common in many developing countries. A landmark genomic study, with contributors from over two-dozen countries, shows the current problem of antibiotic resistant typhoid is driven by a single clade, family of bacteria, called H58 that has now spread globally. ""The data was produced by a consortium of 74 collaborators from the leading laboratories working on typhoid and describes one of the most comprehensive sets of genome data on a single human infectious agent. It represents global co-operation in the scientific community at its best,"" says Dr Vanessa Wong, first author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. ""Typhoid affects around 30 million people each year and global surveillance at this scale is critical to address the ever-increasing public health threat caused by multidrug resistant typhoid in many developing countries around the world."" The study shows the H58 clade of Typhi is displacing other typhoid fever strains that have been established over decades and centuries throughout the typhoid endemic world, completely transforming the genetic architecture of the disease. Multidrug resistant H58 has spread across Asia and Africa over the last 30 years, and created a previously underappreciated and ongoing epidemic through countries in eastern and southern Africa with important public health consequences. Vaccination to prevent the disease is not currently in widespread use in these countries; instead the disease is controlled mainly through use of antimicrobial drugs. H58 Typhi is often resistant to the first-line antimicrobials commonly used to treat the disease, and is continuing to evolve as it spreads to new regions and populations, acquiring novel mutations providing resistance to newer antimicrobial agents, such as ciprofloxacin and azithromycin. ""Multidrug resistant typhoid has been coming and going since the 1970s and is caused by the bacteria picking up novel antimicrobial resistance genes, which are usually lost when we switch to a new drug,"" says Dr Kathryn Holt, senior author from the University of Melbourne. ""In H58, these genes are becoming a stable part of the genome, which means multiply antibiotic resistant typhoid is here to stay."" ""H58 is an example of an emerging multiple drug resistant pathogen which is rapidly spreading around the world,"" says Professor Gordon Dougan, senior author from the Sanger Institute. ""In this study we have been able to provide a framework for future surveillance of this bacterium, which will enable us to understand how antimicrobial resistance emerges and spreads intercontinentally, with the aim to facilitate prevention and control of typhoid through the use of effective antimicrobials, introduction of vaccines, and water and sanitation programmes."" The publication of this research in Nature Genetics coincides with the 9th International Conference on Typhoid and invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonelloses held by the Coalition against Typhoid (CaT), where these results will be shared with the scientific community. The meeting brings together an international group of healthcare and public health experts, researchers and clinicians to focus on strategies to counteract the spread of typhoid in endemic countries. ""These results reinforce the message that bacteria do not obey international borders and any efforts to contain the spread of antimicrobial resistance must be globally coordinated,"" says Dr Stephen Baker, an author from The Hospital for Tropical Diseases, an Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Published: May 13, 2015"

Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Research (MJFF) has announced the acquisition of a library of research tools around the parkin protein from Imago Pharmaceuticals. The Foundation believes these tools - cell lines, plasmids, compounds and more - will accelerate biological study and drug development against this promising disease modification target. Imago purchased the tools as part of a deal with health firm Perrigo in late 2014. These parkin assets originated at now-defunct biotech Elan Pharmaceuticals, where Imago leaders worked on another target: c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK. They are continuing work on JNK inhibitors as potential therapeutics for inflammatory, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson s disease. MJFF bought hundreds of parkin tools for a cost covering storage and shipment. Foundation staffand advisors are now strategizing where to invest in further testing and replication.  We re immensely grateful to Imago for offering this valuable library of varied research tools,  said Marco Baptista, PhD, who leads the MJFF Parkin Program.  The availability of these resources will significantly speed parkin research and the field s ability to test new concepts toward a therapy that may have clinical relevance for millions living with Parkinson s disease.  The research tools deemed most valuable will join the MJFF Research Tools Catalog, a listing of assets from antibodies to viral vectors managed by the Foundation. MJFF makes these tools easily and affordably available to the research community to break down barriers to progress and advance Parkinson s discovery and drug development.  We believe that there is substantial value in the Parkin Program assets and that The Michael J. Fox Foundation is uniquely positioned to maximize this value,  said Irene Griswold-Prenner, PhD, Co-Founder and CSO of Imago Pharmaceuticals.  The Parkin Program was developed at Elan, where significant time and resources were invested in this program. With MJFF making the parkin reagents broadly available to the Parkinson s disease research community, these reagents can be maximally utilized and increase the probability of benefiting Parkinson s patients.  The parkin protein is a target of interest for researchers seeking to develop treatments to slow or stop progression of Parkinson s disease, an unmet need. Currently available therapies treat only the symptoms of the disease. Mutations in the parkin (PARK2) gene are associated with young-onset Parkinson s disease and lead to dysfunction of the parkin protein. Scientists believe that the protein plays a role in mitophagy and mitochondrial function and that parkin levels are reduced as we age. MJFF is funding a consortia of investigators studying the biology of parkin and the development of both parkin replacement and activation therapies for those with the PARK2 mutation and with other forms of Parkinson s disease (i.e., sporadic, associated with other genetic mutations), respectively. The Foundation will work with funded researchers to fold the parkin tools into their studies first then roll them out to the greater research community later this year.","Published: May 13, 2015"

Their research showed that sd rxRNA compounds developed to target TYR, lead to a visible reduction in pigmentation in cultured melanocytes. In vitro experiments have been carried out using a 3 dimensional tissue culture model of human epidermis that contains melanocytes. The results of these experiments show that sd-rxRNA compounds targeting tyrosinase, in this model, are at least one hundred times more potent than kojic acid, a well-characterized skin lightening agent in reducing the melanin production in melanocytes. They also presented results on sd-rxRNA compounds targeting MMP1. In this discovery program, multiple potent sd-rxRNAs that target MMP1 have been identified and evaluated. The data displayed show a reduction in MMP1 mRNA levels that corresponds to a similar reduction in MMP1 enzyme activity in HT-1080 cells, a cell line useful for research related to cancer of connective tissues.  In addition, silencing of MMP1 expression in an in vitro scratch assay resulted in reduced migration of A549 cells, a clinically relevant non-small cell lung cancer cell line.  Reduced migration in a scratch assay may indicate a reduction in the invasive nature of the cancer cell due to MMP1 reduction as a result of sd-rxRNA treatment.

Seeing these roadside markers may cause you to slow down, change lanes or start thinking about lunch. In a similar way, cellular structures called microtubules are tagged with a variety of chemical markers that can influence cell functions. The pattern of these markers makes up the  tubulin code  and according to a paper published in Cell, scientists at National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) have uncovered the mechanism behind one of the main writers of this code, tubulin tyrosine ligase-7 (TTLL7).  Understanding the structural characteristics of this specific molecule opens the door to learning how elaborate patterns of chemical markers are laid down on microtubules. Deciphering the tubulin code could tell us how the markers affect normal cellular function as well as what happens when they are damaged, which can lead to neurodegenerative disorders,  said Antonina Roll-Mecak, Ph.D., NINDS scientist and senior author of the study. TTLL7 is a protein that adds glutamate tags onto microtubules. Using a number of advanced imaging and biochemical techniques, Dr. Roll-Mecak and her colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, have revealed the 3-D structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule. There are nine proteins that make up the TTLL family, but TTLL7 is the most abundant in the brain and one of the main tubulin code writers. These results represent the first atomic structure of any member of the TTLL family. The findings define how TTLL7 interacts with microtubules and how members of the TTLL family use common strategies to mark microtubules with glutamate tags. Dr. Roll-Mecak and her team were able to see how TTLL7 positions itself on the microtubule by grabbing onto the microtubule tails.  This was a very surprising result, as no one had been able to visualize these tails on the microtubule before,  said Dr. Roll-Mecak. Microtubules are cylindrical structures that provide shape to cells and act as conveyor belts, ferrying molecular cargo throughout cells. Although all microtubules have the same basic appearance, they are marked on their outside surface with a variety of chemical groups. These markers impact a cell s activity by changing the stability of microtubules, thus affecting cell shape, or by repositioning molecular cargo traveling on the microtubules.  The microtubule markers are constantly being added and removed, depending on the local needs of the cell. Think about a highway system where street signs are constantly changing and roads are quickly built or torn apart,  said Dr. Roll-Mecak. The most common microtubule marker in the brain is glutamate. The addition of glutamate markers to microtubules plays important roles in brain development and brain cell repair following injury. For example, one of the signatures of damaged cells in cancer or blunt trauma is a change in the pattern of these microtubule markers. In addition, mutations in TTLL genes have been linked with several neurodegenerative disorders.  Our detailed analysis of TTLL7 also may provide important insights into ways that the other members of the TTLL family function. This study is the first step in gaining a more complete picture of how the tubulin code is established,  said Dr. Roll-Mecak. Her lab plans to extend their research by investigating interactions between members of this family of proteins.  We want to mix and match the TTLL proteins to see how we can control patterns of microtubule tagging. From that, we can learn how the cell is making those patterns and what happens during cellular damage, as in cancers or neurodegeneration, when these patterns are disrupted,  said Dr. Roll-Mecak. She added that this research may lead to the development of small molecules that can regulate activity of TTLL proteins, which may have implications for disorders linked to mutations in TTLL genes.","Published: May 13, 2015"

The work has been published in the Cell Stem Cell journal, the main international reference in stem cell research. The mission of neural stem cells located in the hippocampus, one of the main regions of the brain, is to generate new neurons during the adult life of mammals, including human beings, of course, and their function is to participate in certain types of learning and responses to anxiety and stress. Using an epilepsy model in genetically modified mice, the researchers have discovered that hippocampal neural stem cells stop generating new neurons and are turned into reactive astrocytes, a cell type that promotes inflammation and alters communication between neurons. This research work has also made it possible to confirm the hypothesis in a previous piece of research by these researchers; this hypothesis established that even though neuronal hyperexcitation does not go as far as to cause convulsions, it does induce the massive activation of neural stem cells and their resulting premature exhaustion; as a result, neurogenesis (generation of new neurons) in the hippocampus ends up chronically reduced. Juan Manuel Encinas, who is leading the study, highlights the fact that ""this discovery has enabled us to gain a better understanding about how neural stem cells function. We have shown that in addition to generating neurons and astrocytes, neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus can generate reactive astrocytes following an epileptic seizure"". Even though the work has been carried out on experimental animals, this discovery has clear implications in clinical practice and in the quest for new therapies for epilepsy given that the generation of new neurons (neurogenesis) is a process that is negatively affected in epileptic seizures located in the hippocampus. ""If we can manage to preserve the population of neural stem cells and their capacity to generate new neurons in humans, it may be possible to prevent the development of certain symptoms associated with epilepsy and very likely to mitigate the damage that is caused in the hippocampus,"" pointed out Juan Manuel Encinas. In this ambitious, multidisciplinary project they have collaborated with research groups attached to institutions such as the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston (United States), the Universit  Catholique de Louvain (Belgium), the Achucarro centre itself, and the UPV/EHU's Genetic Expression Service.

But a new study from University of California (UC) Berkeley shows that hallucinations and delusions associated with psychiatric disorders seldom foreshadow acts of aggression. In a painstaking review of 305 violent incidents in the United States, the researchers found that only 12 percent were preceded by psychosis. While numerous studies have found that brutality and bloodshed are more likely to be sparked by anger, access to firearms and substance abuse, this latest analysis is the first to look at the regularity of psychosis-induced violence among the mentally ill. The results, recently reported in the online edition of the journal Clinical Psychological Science, challenge the media-fueled stereotype of homicidal mayhem.  High-profile mass shootings capture public attention and increase vigilance of people with mental illness. But our findings clearly show that psychosis rarely leads directly to violence,  said study lead author Jennifer Skeem, a clinical psychologist and associate dean of research at UC Berkeley s School of Social Welfare. Skeem and fellow researchers at the University of Virginia and Columbia University focused on the most violent patients tracked in the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment study, a major 1998 analysis of more than 1,100 offenders who had been discharged from psychiatric facilities. Specifically, the researchers looked at a subgroup of 100 high-risk patients, who had been involved in two or more violent incidents in the year after they were discharged from a psychiatric facility, to establish their mental states at the time they committed acts of violence.  We wanted to examine the small group of people with repeated violence and see how consistently these violent incidents were caused by hallucinations and delusions,  Skeem said. In addition to reviewing records, they interviewed former patients about what they were thinking and feeling immediately before they engaged in violence, and sought the perspectives of their friends and family members. The results revealed that psychosis preceded only 12 percent of the violent acts they committed following their release. Moreover, while psychosis drove one violent incident, it was rarely implicated in subsequent ones, the study found. The study defines violence as battery resulting in physical injury, sexual assault, and assaults or threats with a weapon. Mental illnesses ranged from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to severe anxiety and depression. While mass shootings account for a fraction of U.S. gun deaths, each one can influence public policy. For example, the 2014 shooting spree in Isla Vista near Santa Barbara, in which 24-year-old Elliot Rodgers killed six people, spurred the U.S. House of Representatives to pass an amendment to boost funding to add more mental health records to the nation s background check system for firearm purchases. And, after the 2013 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed his mother, 20 children and six school staff members, New York passed the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, which requires mental health professionals to report clients who could harm themselves or others so those names can be matched against a gun permit database. Meanwhile, a murder trial is currently under way for 27-year-old James Holmes, who opened fire on a Batman movie audience in Aurora in 2012, killing 12. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In the wake of that mass shooting, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed a bill allocating $20 million for an expansion of mental health services, including walk-in crisis centers and a 24-hour hotline. That bill also created a task force to look at strengthening existing laws for involuntary commitment for mental health treatment. Mental health professionals and advocates warn that these high-profile cases perpetuate the stigma of mental illness, and keep people who are suffering from psychiatric disorders from disclosing their condition and seeking help. In fact, they say, people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than vice versa. A study published in February in the American Journal of Public Health found that fewer than 5 percent of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness, and that the mentally ill are far more likely than the average person to be the victims of violent crime.  None of this detracts from the message that people with mental illness need access to psychiatric services,  Skeem said.  But it s important to remember that risk factors for violence   such as substance abuse, childhood maltreatment, neighborhood disadvantage   are mostly shared by people with and without mental illness, and that s what we should be focused on if maximizing public safety is our goal.

Brandon Kim would know. The biology graduate student at San Diego State University investigates the molecular tricks bacteria use to convince their host that they are harmless and cause disease. In a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Kim and his lab mentor, San Diego State University (SDSU) biology professor Kelly Doran, describe their recent discovery that bacteria take advantage of a molecular warning signal and induce the brain's cellular armor to temporarily break down, letting in the bacterial horde. Their discovery could have far-reaching implications for treating and preventing bacterial meningitis. The blood-brain barrier is a thin network of blood vessels whose cells abut each other very closely, forming protein junctions too tight for bacteria and viruses to fit through. The barrier's purpose is to prevent unwanted material from crossing over from the surrounding bloodstream into brain tissue. ""You can think of the blood-brain barrier as a brick wall,"" explained Kim, who is completing his doctorate in Doran's lab. ""Each cell of the blood-brain barrier is a brick and these tight junctions are the mortar."" Like castle guards, the cells that form this barrier can selectively let through nutrients and other ""approved"" molecules needed for normal brain function. When bacteria or viruses do manage to slip past the blood-brain barrier and infect brain tissue, it can result in bacterial meningitis, a frequently deadly disease caused when the brain becomes dangerously inflamed. Using cell cultures, zebrafish and mice as models, Kim and Doran investigated how one type of bacteria, group B streptococcus, gets through the brain's defenses. By observing the bacteria's advance at different points in time and analyzing which molecular processes were active at the time, the researchers discovered an interesting result. When receptors along the blood side of the blood-brain barrier detect group B strep, the system fires off a molecular ""danger"" signal. However, tied into this protective molecular signal is another detrimental signal. When these blood-brain barrier cells fire off their danger signal, it not only induces the brain's molecular ""help"" response but also induces a gene to produce a transcription factor protein known as Snail1 that contributes the breakdown of the barrier's tight junctions. In doing so, the barrier unwittingly destroys its own integrity and permits the bacteria to enter the brain. This study is the first to look at Snail1 in the context of meningitis. Previous research has described Snail1 as a factor of invasive cancer. Understanding this process could allow scientists to develop therapeutics that temporarily control Snail1 expression and prevent the blood-brain barrier from acting on the hijacked self-destruct signal. Additionally, it might also allow researchers to harness the same process for good, designing drugs that tell the blood-brain barrier to let them through so they can fight various brain diseases. ""This finding will change the way that we view bacterial meningitis as a whole and may highlight new ways of treatment in the future,"" Kim said.

A draft platypus genome was published in Nature in 2008, but Martin noted that it is incomplete because only a small portion of scaffolds were able to be assigned to the platypus' 21 autosome pairs, as much of the genome is marked by repetitive sequences. To improve on that assembly, she and her colleagues sequenced 61 platypuses from 14 rivers in eastern Australia and Tasmania using a combination of approaches, including long mate-pair reads, BACs, and fosmids, as well as Illumina Moleculo and optical mapping-derived reads. At this point, Martin said that she and her colleagues have been able to reduce the errors and fill in about a third of the gaps. She also noted that they took a stringent approach to SNP calling and only called ones that were flagged by both GATK and CORTEX, generating some 2.4 million SNPs. There are numerous lines of evidence, Martin said, suggesting that the platypus lacks any PRDM9 genes, the product of which are responsible in mammals for determining where genomic hotspots of recombination are located. Still, she said that their examination of multiple platypus genomes indicated that there are regions of the genome that are indeed recombination hotspots. Platypuses from rivers 400 kilometers apart had both overlapping and unique genomic regions where recombination occurred. She added that at a finer scale there are differences in recombination rates between platypus populations. This, Martin said, suggests that there may either be undetected PRDM9 genes in the platypus genome or a new mechanism that is acting to mark recombination hotspots in the platypus. Rather than relying on one pair of sex chromosomes, the platypus genome has five   a male platypus has five X and five Y chromosomes, all of which are linked together in a chain through nine pseudoautosomal regions during cell division. Martin noted that the chain is thought to have evolved starting from the X5Y5 end down on to the X1Y1 end through serial translocations, and the different XY pairs have different ages. The reference platypus genome was a derived from a female animal, so Martin and her colleagues had to determine the Y sequence by assembling male-specific reads, mapping them to the female reference, and seeing where they diverged. They noted that Y-specific sequences, especially ones near the PAR boundaries, are similar to the X-chromosome versions, and that there appeared to be some variation based on which river the platypus hailed from. One male sample, she noted, had a PAR boundary that was shifted with respect to what many of his fellow males had, though a few others from his river had the polymorphism. This, Martin said, suggests that a rather recent recombination event has taken place between the Y and the X chromosome. The event, she added, could either have been due to meiotic recombination or non-allelic homologous recombination.","Published: May 12, 2015"

The partnership plans to combine GSK s expertise in medicines discovery, development, and manufacturing with UNC-Chapel Hill s research and translational medicine capabilities, researchers, and access to patients and funding.  This partnership is a testament to our past and present leadership, innovation and commitment to this field,  GSK CEO Sir Andrew Witty said in a statement.  We are inspired by the confidence that with the right resources and research teams, we will be able to make a meaningful impact towards a cure for HIV."" The partners said a  small  research team from GSK will move to Chapel Hill to be co-located with UNC researchers on laboratory space. The university will provide laboratory space on its medical campus for the new company and the HIV Cure center. The center s HIV research will include  shock and kill,  a search-and-destroy approach to HIV that entails reactivating the cells of people infected with HIV, in order to induce the dormant virus into production so it can be destroyed via antiretroviral therapies. In 2012 a team led by UNC-Chapel Hill researchers showed that latent HIV might be exposed by new therapies. More recently, researchers at the university received FDA approval for a study in HIV-positive volunteers to combine  shock and kill  and an immune-boosting strategy against the virus. ""The 'shock and kill' approach has shown significant promise in early translational research on humans and has been the focus of research for the last several years,"" David Margolis, M.D., director of UNC s Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, and leader of the Collaboratory of AIDS Researchers for Eradication (CARE), said in a statement. Qura will manage business aspects of the partnership, including intellectual property, commercialization, manufacturing, and governance. The partners said yesterday they hope the company and research center will serve as catalysts for additional partners and public funding. Qura and the research center will both be advised by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV-focused drug developer majority-owned by GSK, with Pfizer and Shionogi as equity partners. GSK said its partnership with UNC will be separate from its activity in the discovery of antiretroviral therapies for Viiv; the pharma giant's HIV Discovery Performance Unit will continue its work on new antiretrovirals at Research Triangle Park. Last week, GSK balked at a previously-planned spinoff of Viiv, citing stronger-than-expected launches for two new HIV treatments: Tivicay  (dolutegravir) generated sales of  112 million (about $173.8 million) during the first quarter of this year following its ongoing rollout, while Triumeq (abacavir/dolutegravir /lamivudine) racked up  81 million ($125.7 million) after launches in the U.S. and much of Europe. Those products helped boost Viiv revenues by 42% during the first quarter of this year compared with Q1 2014, to  446 million ($692.1 million), driven by growth of 66% in the U.S., and 35% in Europe; elsewhere in the world  international  revenues rose 9%. Viiv s numbers contrasted with GSK s 7% slide in Q1 pharmaceuticals sales due to sagging sales of established medicines. That fueled speculation among analysts that GSK retained Viiv to prop up numbers in its pharma unit. GSK, however, has said its Viiv decision will further its commitment to fighting HIV the same goal it articulated in launching the partnership with UNC-Chapel Hill.  There is clear scope to develop multiple dolutegravir-based regimens for treatment of HIV over the next few years,  GSK said May 6 in its announcement of first-quarter results.  Having reviewed this very positive outlook, GSK has concluded that retaining its full, existing holding in ViiV Healthcare is in the best interests of the Group and GSK will not now be initiating an IPO of a minority stake.

Effective treatments such as vaccines and drug therapies are not available for many of these infections since the outbreaks mostly occur in developing countries with limited financial resources. Moreover, the genomes of many haemorrhagic fever viruses mutate rapidly, enabling them to quickly adapt to potential drug treatments and evade the immune system. ""Although our work does not directly lead to treatments on a short term, it does identify a process where the virus could be vulnerable to drug therapy, or how we might design an attenuated viral strain for vaccine development,"" said first author Normand Cyr, a postdoctoral researcher. ""Identification of the Achilles heels of haemorrhagic fever viruses like the Rift Valley fever virus will help inspire additional research and eventually lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat these deadly tropical infections."" ""Our group used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies to investigate the structural properties of an important viral protein required for virulence of the Rift Valley fever virus, a virus that causes infections in both humans and livestock similar to the Ebola virus,"" Omichinski explained. ""Viral proteins such as the Non-structural protein (NSs) studied here bind to the transcription machinery of human cells via the p62 subunit of the TFIIH protein complex, which leads to the formation of nuclear filaments that are essential for propagation of the virus. The structural details reported show that the viral protein uses a simple so-called  XaV motif that is similar to that found in human DNA repair proteins, and blocking this binding event with drugs would certainly weaken the virulence of the virus.""Credit picture : Beno t Gougeon  ""Viruses and other infectious agents mutate and constantly adapt to treatments. Therefore, it is critical to conduct this type of basic research so that humans can stay one step ahead of potential outbreaks of viral infections, which is one of the core missions of our Department,"" said Prof. Christian Baron, Chair of the Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine. ""The structural biology facilities at Univ. of Montr al are cutting edge, thanks to important investments from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and these facilities are helping us to unravel the molecular details of how the Rift Vally fever virus functions,"" Omichinski added. The Univ. of Montreal team worked in collaboration with senior co-author Kylene Kehn-Hall's group at the National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases in the U.S., as the U.S. team has specialized biosafety level 3 facilities where they can work with such contagious viruses. Indeed, Americans and Canadians have every reason to be concerned about the future of this line of research. ""Climate changes and world-wide travel are increasing the risk of haemorrhagic fever viruses even in Canada. Warmer temperatures and increased travel are bringing such tropical diseases much closer to home and as a result we cannot afford to ignore the global health status of populations in other countries. It is therefore critical that we gain more knowledge into the molecular details of viral function so that we can develop more effective treatments and control the spread of these diseases,"" Omichinski said.","Published: May 12, 2015"

Some strains of E. coli normally live in the intestines of humans, and are important for a healthy digestive tract. However, for people who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), these innocuous strains may proliferate during a flare-up and further contribute to disease and discomfort. According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 1 million Americans suffer from IBD, which includes a broad range of gastrointestinal tract problems such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. ""Several types of inflammatory bowel disease are characterized by expansion of the opportunistic E. coli in the gut,"" said Matam Vijay-Kumar, assistant professor of nutritional sciences and medicine at Penn State. ""However, the mechanisms by which E. coli can thwart the hostile host innate immune system are poorly understood. Identifying these mechanisms will help to reduce the E. coli burden in the inflamed gut and prevent chronic extra-intestinal diseases."" Vijay-Kumar and colleagues studied the interactions between enterobactin, myeloperoxidase and lipocalin 2 and how they regulate E. coli in the intestine and report their findings today (May 12) in Nature Communications. Enterobactin (Ent) is an iron-loving chemical secreted by E. coli that takes iron from host proteins in the body and aids the proliferation of E. coli. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an antibacterial protein that white blood cells produce to fight bacteria. However, Ent inhibits MPO from doing its job. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is another protein, also produced by white blood cells, that gathers up Ent -- so that bacteria fail to obtain a sufficient amount of iron for their survival. The researchers found that Lcn2 can counter the effects of Ent on MPO. ""These bacteria can be harmful under special circumstances, such as IBD,"" said Vijay-Kumar. ""Most E. coli express enterobactin, a siderophore, and to avoid its recognition by the host lipocalin 2, they have the flexibility to express stealth siderophores. Strictly speaking, chelation of iron in the gut by enterobactin and inhibition of host MPO at the same time is positive for E. coli and negative for the host."" With this study, the researchers say, they have defined a new defense mechanism used by E. coli residing in a human or animal host -- the inhibition of MPO by Ent. ""We have to find a way to identify the drugs which can inhibit or degrade secreted enterobactin,"" said Vijay-Kumar. ""Alternatively, since MPO is known to be pro-inflammatory not only in IBD but also in other inflammatory diseases, it may be possible to develop enterobactin-based drugs to alleviate inflammatory pathways.""","Published: May 12, 2015"

Group revenues increased to EUR 70.4 million (Q1 2014: EUR 15.9 million). The increase is attributable to revenue booked in connection with the ending of the collaboration with Celgene on MorphoSys's proprietary drug candidate MOR202. This comprised the full realization of deferred revenues from an up-front payment received from Celgene in 2013 together with a one-time termination payment. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to EUR 52.8 million (Q1 2014: EUR 1.4 million). On 31 March 2015, MorphoSys held cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and financial assets classified as loans and receivables of EUR 349.7 million in comparison to EUR 352.8 million on 31 December 2014. Highlights of the First Quarter 2015   MorphoSys and Emergent BioSolutions initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in prostate cancer patients with the bi-specific antibody MOR209/ES414. The open-label phase 1 clinical trial will be conducted in clinical centers in the US and Australia with planned enrollment of up to 130 patients.  Upon publication of the 2014 annual financial results, MorphoSys provided an overview of the 2015 development plan for its proprietary portfolio. Among others, MorphoSys plans to initiate two phase 2 clinical trials in the second half of 2015 to evaluate MOR208 in combination with lenalidomide and bendamustine in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  MorphoSys and Celgene mutually agreed to end their collaboration to co-develop and co-promote MOR202. MorphoSys will continue as planned with the clinical development of the compound, which is currently in a MorphoSys-sponsored phase 1/2a trial in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The first clinical data will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology at the end of May/early June.  With the end of the collaboration with Celgene on MOR202, MorphoSys updated its financial guidance for the current financial year and announced that it expects revenues for the 2015 financial year in the range of EUR 101 million to EUR 106 million (previous guidance: EUR 58 million to EUR 63 million) and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the range of EUR 9 million to EUR 16 million (previous guidance: a loss before interest and taxes of EUR 20 million to EUR 30 million).  MorphoSys announced its nomination of three new Supervisory Board candidates, Ms. Wendy Johnson, Mr. Klaus K hn, and Dr. Frank Morich, for election at the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2015.  Shortly after the end of the first quarter of 2015, MorphoSys announced the achievement of a clinical milestone with the initiation of a phase 2 study of the antibody guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis by its partner Janssen Biotech.  At the end of the first quarter of 2015, MorphoSys's product pipeline comprised a total of 95 therapeutic antibodies, including 23 clinical programs. Three partnered programs are currently in phase 3 trials. ""We have a very clear roadmap for our proprietary product portfolio in 2015 focusing on how we will advance MOR209/ES414 together with our partner Emergent BioSolutions as well as MOR208 and MOR202 for our own account"", commented Dr. Simon Moroney, Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys AG. ""With MOR209/ES414, the fourth candidate in our growing proprietary portfolio of compounds has entered clinical development, thereby bringing the total number of clinical programs in our pipeline to 23."" ""The financial performance in the first quarter of 2015 was significantly influenced by the termination agreement with Celgene and the resulting one-off effects. This notwithstanding, MorphoSys has made a solid start to 2015 and the Company is well positioned to meet its increased financial goals for the full year,"" stated Jens Holstein, Chief Financial Officer of MorphoSys AG. Financial Review for the First Three Months of 2015 (IFRS) Group revenues for the first three months of 2015 amounted to EUR 70.4 million (Q1 2014: EUR 15.9 million). This rise was primarily the result of the termination of the cooperation with Celgene for the co-development and co-promotion of MOR202 and the subsequent recognition of the respective deferred revenues. The Proprietary Development segment recorded revenues of EUR 59.4 million (Q1 2014: EUR 4.1 million). These revenues originated mainly from the termination of the contract with Celgene. Revenues in the Partnered Discovery segment comprised EUR 10.5 million in funded research and licensing fees (Q1 2014: EUR 10.9 million) and EUR 0.5 million in success-based payments (Q1 2014: EUR 0.9 million). Total operating expenses for the first three months of 2015 amounted to EUR 17.7 million (Q1 2014: EUR 14.5 million). Total research and development expenses were EUR 14.7 million (Q1 2014: EUR 11.2 million). R&D expenses consisted mainly of personnel expenses and expenses for external laboratory services. Investment in proprietary product and technology development amounted to EUR 10.4 million (Q1 2014: EUR 7.3 million). General and administrative expenses decreased to EUR 3.0 million (Q1 2014: EUR 3.3 million) driven by lower expenses for personnel and for external services. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to EUR 52.8 million (Q1 2014: EUR 1.4 million) resulting from the full realization of deferred revenues from an up-front payment received by Celgene.

The new findings, published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics, solidify Notch signalling as a major factor in Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) and further advance diagnosis and treatment of this neonatal disorder - characterised by limb and scalp defects, accompanied by a host of cardiac and vascular complications. The identification of the gene was driven by Professor Richard Trembath and Dr Laura Southgate, from Queen Mary University of London, with subsequent functional analyses primarily conducted by Dr Rajiv Machado and colleagues at the University of Lincoln, UK. The study's joint senior author Dr Machado, from the School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, said: ""Our study, which provides the largest collection of NOTCH1 mutations to date, clearly places this gene as a major causal genetic factor in AOS and in particular when associated with major cardiovascular defects, both developmental and structural. ""This insight into NOTCH1 offers the potential to explain its function in the development of key systems in the body   notably cardiovascular, skeletal and pulmonary systems. The ultimate hope is further research in this area will result in more effective diagnoses, but most importantly treatment therapies, for those affected with this debilitating condition."" The initial gene identification process was based on sequencing the genomes of 12 families affected with AOS. They found that two people from different families had mutations in the NOTCH1 gene. Confirmation of these findings was obtained by screening a cohort of 52 additional patients, which led to the identification of a further eight unique mutations. This study, combined with the earlier publication of NOTCH1 mutations in AOS, is a significant breakthrough in the understanding of this developmental disorder, which currently has no cure. In 2011, Dr Machado and Dr Southgate were integral to efforts that led to the discovery of the ARHGAP31 gene - the first identified molecular defect associated with AOS. This finding was noted by international publications including the American Journal of Medical Genetics which provided an editorial to mark the work. Since then four additional genes, including NOTCH1, have been identified indicating this is a disease underpinned by multiple genetic factors. The collaboration is currently further examining the impact of NOTCH1 mutations described in this study and exploring the possibility of additional mutations in as yet unidentified genes in an extensive cohort of patients.","Published: May 12, 2015"

Study results published May 11 in Diabetes. Researchers at the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch (PECRB), part of the NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, studied 12 men and women with obesity in the facility s metabolic unit. Using a whole-room indirect calorimeter - which allows energy expenditure to be calculated based on air samples - researchers took baseline measurements of the participants  energy expenditure in response to a day of fasting, followed by a six-week inpatient phase of 50 percent calorie reduction. After accounting for age, sex, race and baseline weight, the researchers found that the people who lost the least weight during the calorie-reduced period were those whose metabolism decreased the most during fasting. Those people have what the researchers call a  thrifty  metabolism, compared to a  spendthrift  metabolism in those who lost the most weight and whose metabolism decreased the least.  When people who are obese decrease the amount of food they eat, metabolic responses vary greatly, with a  thrifty  metabolism possibly contributing to less weight lost,  said Susanne Votruba, Ph.D., study author and PECRB clinical investigator.  While behavioral factors such as adherence to diet affect weight loss to an extent, our study suggests we should consider a larger picture that includes individual physiology - and that weight loss is one situation where being thrifty doesn't pay.  Researchers do not know whether the biological differences are innate or develop over time. Further research is needed to determine whether individual responses to calorie reduction can be used to prevent weight gain.  The results corroborate the idea that some people who are obese may have to work harder to lose weight due to metabolic differences,  said Martin Reinhardt, M.D., lead author and PECRB postdoctoral fellow.  But biology is not destiny. Balanced diet and regular physical activity over a long period can be very effective for weight loss.  More than one-third of American adults are obese. Complications from obesity can include heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death.  What we ve learned from this study may one day enable a more personalized approach to help people who are obese achieve a healthy weight,  said NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D.  This study represents the latest advance in NIDDK s ongoing efforts to increase understanding of obesity. ","Published: May 12, 2015"

The new method that combines phase extraction with an enzymatic reaction may eventually be used for an improved and faster screening analysis of isatin as a potential indicator of stress and neurological disorders. Isatin is a small organic molecule found in low concentrations in different tissues and is excreted with the urine via the blood stream. Isatin is supposedly a degradation product from the neurotransmitters, e.g. dopamine and serotonine. The level of isatin is elevated in patients suffering from stress and in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. The level of isatin is also elevated among pregnant women. Isatin is an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, an enzyme that catalyses the initial degradation of dopamine and serotonine. This inhibitory effect makes isatin act as an antidepressant, and it relieves the symptoms of patients suffering from Parkinson's. Collaborators from the University of Oslo are the prime mover in the development of this highly specific method to determine the concentration of isatin in samples of blood and urine, using the bacterial enzyme isatin hydrolase in combination with a two-phase extraction. Isatin hydrolase catalyses the conversion of isatin into isatinate, which is followed by a chemical conversion of isatinate into the fluorescent compound anthranilate. The method can be refined further by substituting the chemical step by an enzyme that is able to convert isatinate into anthranilate. Within several bacterial species, isatin is formed via the degradation of indole 3-acetic acid, but the origin of isatin in humans are not known. The researchers' method to detect isatin might be useful in future experiments to establish the source-tissue and precursors for isatin formation.

But recently, scientists researching melting ice watched a half-foot-long (15-centimeter) fish swim by. Not long after that, they saw shrimp-like creatures. Life that is simultaneously normal and weird, simple and complex thrives in this extreme environment. To the scientists who brave the cold and remoteness to find life amid the ice, it's a source of surprise and wonder. For extreme life experts, it's a testimony to the power of evolution. ""It really shows how tenacious life is,"" said Reed Scherer, a micropaleontology professor at Northern Illinois University. ""The possibilities are just beyond our prediction."" Scientists look at creatures found in harsh Antarctica and ask: If life can survive here, why not on Mars or one of the ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn where water lurks beneath the frozen surface? Maybe we aren't alone. Certainly not here. ""You don't have to be a rocket scientist to look around and see how extreme this environment is,"" biochemist Jenny Blamey said, pointing to the black, volcanic rock covered by ice all around her on Deception Island. She wore a red parka with a black hood that was blown by the hard wind. While she spoke, her glasses fogged up and droplets of rain gathered on them. ""This is really like a desert, where you have extreme low temperatures,"" said Blamey, research director at the Biosciences Foundation in Chile who is studying the genetic material of microorganisms, essentially microbes that can't be seen. Deception Island is a volcanic crater off the Antarctic Peninsula that used to be a refuge for whalers at the turn of the 20th century. It was evacuated many years ago after a handful of eruptions. Yet it is a garden compared to the spot where Ross Powell stopped to talk. Powell had trekked across a separate part of the vast continent, hundreds of miles away from any buildings or research post, in a National Science Foundation mobile base camp. Speaking by satellite phone at the armpit edge of the Ross Ice Shelf in January, the professor from Northern Illinois University described what he and colleagues saw when they stuck a remote-controlled submarine a half mile under the ice to look at the leading underground edge of one of Antarctica's melting ice sheets. It is an area of total darkness, 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the nearest ocean and with just 30 feet of liquid water under the ice. The water is 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius), but the saltiness keeps it from freezing. Scientists turned on the cameras and were astonished to see a fish, thin and almost translucent, darting around and at times seeming to be playing peekaboo with the camera. Orange-shelled creatures called amphipods also drifted by. When the scientists in the makeshift control room on the ice first saw the fish, they ""started screaming and yelling and clapping,"" Powell said. By the time a couple of days had passed, Scherer said the fish had become so common that ""we got to the point of, 'Oh, there's another fish,' instead of, 'Oh my God! There's a fish!'"" As a joke, someone had brought a fish cage from New Zealand. But now it was no joke. The scientists tried to catch a fish using a giant net attached to the submarine's camera system and making leftovers out of bait from the previous night's supper. They never caught a fish, but they did nab some of the amphipods. Still, Scherer, who loves seafood, wasn't tempted to nibble. ""I thought they smelled kind of baity,"" he said. Powell and Scherer are now trying to figure out where the animals came from and, even more importantly, where they get the food to survive. The search for life has also taken scientists to Lake Vostok, considered the most remote place on Earth. The mostly freshwater lake is buried under 2.3 miles (3.7 kilometers) of ice, and hasn't been near open air for 15 million years. A couple of years ago, scientists took water samples from the lake and tested them for traces of life. They found genetic sequences for 3,507 recognizable species as well as about 10,000 species not yet known to science, said Scott Rogers, a professor of microbiology at Bowling Green State University, who worked on the study. ""It seems like most of (the species) were alive recently"" and not fossils from thousands of years ago, Rogers said. About 94 percent of the species they could identify were bacterial, essentially simple microbial life. But there were also fungi and even a couple of genetic traces of microscopic animals. That included DNA from tardigrades, also known as water bears, the tiny creatures that look like one-eyed extraterrestrial grizzlies when seen under an electron microscope. There were even indications that there might be small fish elsewhere in the chilly lake. These types of findings excite astronomers who search for possible forms of life on other planets. Just this month, astronomers found that Jupiter's giant moon Ganymede had water under the ice. So does Europa, another moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. And then there are exoplanets, those circling bodies outside our solar system. When unexpected creatures are found under the ice, ""you start to wonder if that couldn't happen on an icy moon or exoplanet,"" said Lisa Kaltenegger, an astronomer and director of the Institute for Pale Blue Dots at Cornell University. Science doesn't have those cosmic answers yet, but the mysterious fish in the darkness of Antarctica may hold clues.","Published: May 11, 2015"

Until now, multiple skull fractures meant several points of impact to the head and often were thought to suggest child abuse. Roger Haut, a University Distinguished Professor in biomechanics, and Todd Fenton, a forensic anthropologist, have now proven this theory false. They've found that a single blow to the head not only causes one fracture, but may also cause several, unconnected fractures in the skull. Additionally, they ve discovered that not all fractures start at the point of impact   some actually may begin in a remote location and travel back toward the impact site. The team s findings were recently presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.  It s a bit like smashing raw hamburger into a patty on the grill,  Haut said.  When you press down on the meat to flatten it, all the edges crack. That s what can happen when a head injury occurs.  Because piglet skulls have similar mechanical properties as infant human skulls   meaning they bend and break in similar ways   Haut and Fenton used the already deceased specimens in their research and found they were able to classify the different fracture patterns with a high degree of accuracy.  Our impact scenarios on the piglet skulls gave us about an 82 percent accuracy rate, while on the older skulls, it improved to about 95 percent,  Fenton said. To help them get to this level of accuracy, both researchers teamed up with Anil Jain, a University Distinguished Professor in computer science and engineering at MSU, to develop a mathematical algorithm to help classify the fractures.  A major issue in child death cases is you never really know what happened,  Haut said.  The prosecutor may have one idea, the medical examiner another, and the defendant a completely different scenario.  Fenton and Haut s close relationship with medical examiners often results in them being called upon in certain, hard-to-determine cases. They ve used this new knowledge to help solve these cases, but both are also looking to use Jain s algorithm in an online resource that will provide even more assistance to investigators. The team is currently developing a database, or Fracture Printing Interface, that will allow forensic anthropologists and investigators to upload human fracture patterns from different abuse cases and help them determine what most likely caused an injury.  We will never know with 100 percent probability what happened in many of these cases, but this interface will give us a higher chance of figuring that out,  Haut said. Their research has been funded through multiple grants from the National Institute of Justice.","Published: May 11, 2015"

However, this large scale task is a difficult and time-consuming process. The demand for high quality images places greater strains on image acquisition and management, with factors such as cross-modal compatibility, visualization and imaging speed requiring consideration. As a part of advancing neuroscience research, the US and EU depend on developments in IT and imaging to make this task more feasible. Whole-mount digital slide imaging plays an important role by providing high resolution for detailed, integrated models of the brain. Making the generation of whole brain models and simulations a reality depends on the ability to produce high quality images rapidly and combine them with other modalities. Although the creation of reference brains is on the increase, the use of new imaging technology is required to expedite this process. Huron Digital Pathology s TissueScope  solution provides several benefits to researchers creating human brain models, thereby enabling this process to be faster and more feasible than ever before. The BigBrain project at the J lich Research Centre in Germany has led to immense innovation with respect to the generation of reference brains. Led by Katrin Amunts, BigBrain is a free-access 3D reference brain that used whole-mount slide scanning to provide detailed mapping, at an almost cellular level. Before this project, only macroscopic levels of detail, with 1mm resolution, had been achieved for reference brains. Previously, traditional two-dimensional slide scanning had been used to achieve this, but this was restricted to only sections of the brain that researchers chose to slice. However, using whole-mount slide scanning to create a 3D reference brain, the whole border of the cortical ribbon can be defined. Likewise, 3D analysis of the individual variations between macroscopic landmarks and cytoarchitectonic borders has not been possible before. The ability to map functional probability maps to the BigBrain data set means cross-modal research is possible. As a result, brain activity maps, neural projections, and gene expression maps can all be related to cytoarchitecture. All of these new capabilities mean researchers can now validate new hypotheses on the distribution of, for example, fiber bundles, transmitter receptors and genetics. The procedure through which Amunt created BigBrain shows the logistics involved in digital slide scanning, as well as the potential scope for improvement. The process involved embedding the specimen in paraffin and splitting it into 7404 slices that were 20 m thick. The slices were then scanned for over 1000h at 10 m resolution and then downscaled to achieve an overall isotropic resolution of 20 m. The dataset size was one Terabyte in total. Although, models with an even higher resolution are in demand, the projected size of such high resolution data does present computing challenges in terms of being able to actively explore this amount of data rather than simply store it. Moreover, additional data sets that are similar to BigBrain need to be produced because, despite being very powerful, BigBrain only represents the brain of a 65-year old female and researchers need to further analyze the individual variability in the architecture of cortical borders. Given that additional reference brain data sets of similar or even better image quality are required, researchers are asking how this procedure can be improved and whether a balance can be struck between the scanning time and image quality. Some investigators are wondering whether thicker optical z-stacks, enabled via chemical techniques, could be a better technique. These problems and more have been addressed by Huron Digital Pathology s TissueScope , with its high quality and high efficiency scanning making it well suited for the creation of reference brains. The key benefit of TissueScope  is its ability to scan both small and large specimens, with sizes ranging from 1 x 3  up to 6 x 8 . As a result, the scanning time is instantly reduced and the need for stitching and tilting is eliminated. The user interface allows scanning of the specimen at different magnifications including 1x, 2x, 10x, 20x and 0.25 m at 40x, therefore enabling easy imaging of the areas of interest. In addition, TissueScope  can be used to acquire z-stacks and optical sections on specific ranges of tissue up to 500 m or even 2mm in depth using the appropriate clearing methods. Use of the optional TissueSnap  workflow accessory avoids the need for pre-processing and preview scanning, meaning the main scanner can operate at full throughput and the time to view is further reduced. The scans performed using a Huron scanner are stored in non-proprietary, open .tiff format, which enables researchers to use a range of image analysis software to create 3D reconstructions of tissue. The time BigBrain took to acquire data for all 7404 images was 1000h. Overall, it took five years to develop BigBrain, with one year dedicated to data acquisition and the other four years to constructing the 3D volume. By contrast, the TissueScope is able to scan a whole brain slide at 1 m resolution, in just 12min, suggesting that future reference brains using TissueScope could achieve a resolution 400x higher than the current BigBrain and acquire these images within six months. Huron Digital Pathology has already supported various human brain research projects by enabling high resolution, whole brain images to be acquired.","Published: May 11, 2015"

Although several early-stage West Nile virus vaccine clinical trials have been completed to date, no human vaccine has been approved for commercial use.  West Nile virus represents a significant threat to public health in the United States, especially among the immunocompromised and the elderly,  said Mark Slifka, Ph.D., professor of molecular microbiology and immunology in the OHSU School of Medicine; senior scientist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center at OHSU; and president and chief scientific officer of Najit Technologies, Inc.  We believe our vaccine approach will not only be safe and effective for West Nile virus, but it could also provide significant protection against other important human pathogens, including yellow fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and, potentially even Ebola.  OHSU s investigational West Nile virus vaccine candidate was created using a proprietary, peroxide-based platform called HydroVax . The platform is unique in that it is the first vaccine production system to demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide can inactivate viruses for use as vaccines while still maintaining key immunogenic, or immune-system triggering, structures. Older vaccine production systems use formaldehyde-fixed  dead  forms of the virus, but this often results in substantial damage to the native surface structures of the virus. To develop a clinical-grade West Nile virus vaccine for the Phase I clinical trial, Slifka and colleagues worked with Michael Diamond, M.D., Ph.D., a world-renowned expert on West Nile virus immunology and pathogenesis at Washington University in St. Louis, and Ian Amanna, Ph.D., associate vice president for research at Najit Technologies, Inc., an Oregon-based OHSU spinoff company that serves as the researchers  industry partner.  The generation of a safe and effective inactivated vaccine against West Nile virus could minimize disease, long-term disability and even death in vulnerable individuals,  said Diamond.  This vaccine showed great promise in pre-clinical models in animals. We are optimistic that it will stimulate protective immune responses that control infection and disease. This first trial in humans is an important milestone.  In 2009, Slifka, Diamond, Amanna and colleagues received a $7.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a new West Nile Vaccine. In 2012, using a mouse model, the researchers proved their proprietary HydroVax platform was a safer and more effective method for creating vaccines than current vaccine production systems (Nature Medicine). In 2013, the Diamond laboratory showed that HydroVax could protect aged mice from lethal West Nile virus infection (Journal of Virology). Last month, an independent group of researchers led by Yoshiro Kawaoka, Ph.D., at the University of Wisconsin used HydroVax to develop an Ebola vaccine that provided complete protection against lethal infection in a primate model (Science). West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne human pathogen that has become endemic in North America and causes substantial disease and death. Some estimate that as many as 3 million West Nile virus infections have occurred in the United States since 1999. A total of 47 states and the District of Columbia reported West Nile virus infections in people, birds or mosquitoes in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It is truly gratifying to see this novel approach to vaccine development discovered by Dr. Slifka and his colleagues take this critical step toward treatment of infectious diseases in humans,  said Dan Dorsa, Ph.D., senior vice president for research at OHSU.

The research was led by researchers at Princeton University s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  We already knew that measles attacks immune memory, and that it was immunosuppressive for a short amount of time. But this paper suggests that immune suppression lasts much longer than previously suspected,  said C. Jessica Metcalf, co-author and assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and public affairs at Princeton.  In other words, if you get measles, three years down the road, you could die from something that you would not die from had you not been infected with measles.   Our findings suggest that measles vaccines have benefits that extend beyond just protecting against measles itself,  said lead author Michael Mina, a medical student at Emory University who worked on the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton.  It is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health.  Mina was motivated to pursue this analysis after reading a paper co-authored by Rik L. de Swart from Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, which found profound associations between measles and memory-cell depletion. This research demonstrated that the measles virus attacks T lymphocytes   cells that build up  immune memory  against other diseases   creating a state of immune amnesia. After about a month, these immune memory cells return, but instead of protecting against previously encountered infections, they were almost entirely directed against measles alone. Mina wondered how quickly the immune system would become broadly protective again and went on to examine detailed population data available from the United States, England and Wales, and Denmark   the only countries with the key variables required for the analysis. In addition to Metcalf and de Swart, Mina worked with Bryan Grenfell, Kathryn Briger and Sarah Fenton Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Public Affairs at Princeton, and Albert Osterhaus, professor of virology at Eramus University. Together, the research team hypothesized that if immune amnesia does occur because of measles, it would be evident in population data. The researchers looked at deaths among children between the ages of 1 and 9 in Europe, and 1 and 14 in the United States, in both pre- and post-vaccine eras. They ran a basic association test   comparing measles incidence and deaths. The initial analysis came back statistically significant but weaker than expected, not showing a strong connection between the two. At this point, Mina and his collaborators decided to evaluate the data making different assumptions about how long the possible immune-amnesia effects of measles may last. This exploration uncovered a very strong correlation between measles incidence and deaths from other diseases, allowing for a  lag period  averaging roughly 28 months after infection with measles. This finding was consistent in all age groups across the three countries and also consistent in pre- and post-vaccine eras.  In other words, reducing measles incidence appears to cause a drop in deaths from other infectious diseases due to indirect effects of measles infection on the human immune system,  Grenfell said.  At the population level, the data suggests that when measles was rampant, it may have led to a reduction in herd immunity against other infectious diseases.  With regard to policy, the research findings suggest that   apart from the major direct benefits   measles vaccination may also provide indirect immunological protection against other infectious diseases. Mina and his collaborators hope the paper will spur future research.  The real smoking gun would be to carry out cohort studies, as well as to explore the immunological mechanisms underlying the responses we see,  Grenfell said.  We also intend to analyze the long-term impact of  immunological amnesia  on morbidity or sickness,  Mina said.  And we need to explore consequences for resource-poor countries, where measles causes much more immediate mortality. ","Published: May 11, 2015"

Metabolomics involves the detection and quantification of small molecules (metabolites) in living organisms using mass spectrometers. The measurements made from these sophisticated instruments are analysed using computational programs to determine the abundances of metabolites, the results of which can provide an indication of an organism s cellular condition and health. These data can be stored and shared through public databases such as MetaboLights, which launched in 2012. However, data sharing is not yet keeping pace with the publication of scientific papers in metabolomics. The award of  30,000 from the BBSRC will enable the consortium to host training workshops to support scientists in the UK and China in managing and sharing their metabolomics data and analyses. Such computational skills have been highlighted by the BBSRC as being essential for furthering the impact of science on society and the economy. The consortium will work with Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, ELIXIR and the Galaxy Project: four international networks dedicated to building computational and bioinformatics skills capacity.  Dr Peter Li, Data Organisation Manager at GigaScience, commented,  This funding will enable a synergistic exchange of our experience in data curation and publication with the expertise in metabolomics teaching provided by our UK-based partners.  He continued,  Bioinformatics education is of great interest to BGI as a channel of communicating how science can be performed in an open manner which we are promoting in GigaScience.  Dr Christoph Steinbeck of EMBL-EBI added,  There is already a lot of commitment in metabolomics research community to data sharing and reuse   our main challenge is simply in training people how best to incorporate this into their regular working practices. The BBSRC has recognised that this area of molecular biology is growing more quickly than any other, and that we need to do everything we can to train and support scientists in sharing data. That will lead to better quality data, more efficient research and shorter time to discovery.  Dr Vicky Schneider, Head of 361  Division (Scientific Training, Education & Learning) at TGAC, said:  In partnership with GigaScience and BGI, we aim to revive the sharing of metabolomics data in the UK and internationally. TGAC will play a pivotal role in facilitating the provision of informatics training for scientists to curate and share data in metabolomics to enhance its value in the global research community.

The most surprising moment was when we were a couple of weeks into the project and were were looking at the first datasets that we retrieved from the sequencing center,  senior author Uppsala University microbiologist Thijs Ettema told Bioscience Technology.  We started finding all these 'eukaryotic-type' genes among these archaeal sequences. We very soon realized that this was either a very big and significant find, or some kind of weird artefact. After doing a whole array of checks in order to make sure that we could rule out the latter, we were sure: we found an archaeon that shared several genes uniquely with eukaryotes. When later this archaeon, which we then named Lokiarchaeon, turned out to form a sistergroup with eukaryotes in the Tree of Life, we were ecstatic!  Until recent years, it has been believed that life at base is comprised of three distinct branches, all of which hailed, individually, from an unknown single ancestor: arachael and bacterial cells, simple cells that lacked nuclei, and complex eukaryotic cells containing nuclei, cytoskeletons, organelles. That three-tree system was proposed by University of Illinois microbiologist Carl Woese, who added a third branch the archaeal branch to the tree in 1977. But at about the same time, a 1967 paper by University of Massachusetts biologist Lynn Margulis began catching on. That unusual paper proposed that humans  mitochondria, the critical energy packs of our cells, are actually bacteria that were once engulfed by other cells. Genetic analyses backing this up, in addition to other genetic data finding similarities between the life branches, led to doubt the three branches rose independently of each other. The Uppsala team s new discovery of Lokiarchaea, which possesses many unique eukaryotic and archaeal qualities, offers what Embley called in a companion commentary  spectacular  evidence that the above independent evolution may indeed not have occurred. Instead, chaotic, complex eukaryotes like us may have emerged out of a two-billion-year old sea of serene, simple life forms due to the unusual engulfing of a bacteria by an archaea, forming a creature rife with new possibilities. The new paper identifies  archaeal forms that are much more closely related to the hypothetical archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes than any other currently known group of archaea,  said Koonin.  These findings clinch the case for the origin of eukaryotes from within the archaeal diversity, and point to specific part of the archaeal evolutionary tree where eukaryotes belong.  Equally importantly, Koonin continued, are the group s findings that,  Lokiarchaeota combine a number of  eukaryotic-like  features that previously have been found scattered among different archaeal genomes. In particular, they encode components of the actin cytoskeleton, the ESCRT-III system for membrane remodeling, and the ubiquitin system. Taken together, these findings give credence to the evolutionary scenario in which the eukaryotes evolved from an archaeon with a complex cellular organization that might have been capable of engulfing bacteria.  Embley said that, in terms of clarifying the origins of our mitochondria,  the new Archaea appear to have the potential for endocytosis and/or phagocytosis (cellular incorporation and/or ingestion). This could allow them to take up material from the environment.  In some versions of endosymbiotic theory, the host for the mitochondrial endosymbiont uses phagocytosis to engulf the bacterium that became the endosymbiont, and eventually the mitochondrion.   On the other hand, he noted:  There is no genetic evidence in the new paper that the new Archaea contain any genes from the mitochondrial endosymbiont, so they do not appear to have mitochondria.  But the newly discovered creature s actin-like proteins may simply indicate, he said, that eukaryotes evolved phagocytosis before acquiring mitochondria. Did the team prove we are descended from Lokiarchaea-like creatures?  I think that the phylogenetic analyses are carefully done and use state-of-the-art methods,  Embley said.  It is really hard to correctly infer events that may have occurred some two billion years ago. But taken together, the combination of the tree, and the enhanced number of eukaryotic-like proteins, are rather convincing for a close relationship between Lokiarchaea and eukaryotes.  I am sure that the new data and analyses will be subjected to very close scrutiny by the community once it is published, and the robustness of the trees and the position of eukaryotes within them, will be carefully tested as part of that process.

Now researchers at the University of Huddersfield have solved one of its few limitations by successfully testing a technique for distinguishing between the DNA   or genetic fingerprint   of identical twins. The probability of a DNA match between two unrelated individuals is about one in a billion.  For two full siblings, the probability drops to one-in-10,000.  But identical twins present exactly the same DNA profile as each other and this has created legal conundrums when it was not possible to tell which of the pair was guilty or innocent of a crime.  This has led to prosecutions being dropped, rather than run the risk of convicting the wrong twin. Now Dr Graham Williams and his Forensic Genetics Research Group at the University of Huddersfield have developed a solution to the problem and published their findings in the journal Analytical Biochemistry. Previous methods have been proposed for distinguishing the DNA of twins.  One is termed  mutation analysis , where the whole genome of both twins is sequenced to identify mutations that might have occurred to one of them.  If such a mutation is identified at a particular location in the twin, then that same particular mutation can be specifically searched for in the crime scene sample.  However, this is very expensive and time-consuming and is unlikely to be paid for by cash-strapped police forces,  according to Dr Williams, who has shown that a cheaper, quicker technique is available. It is based on the concept of DNA methylation, which is effectively the molecular mechanism that turns various genes on and off. As twins get older, the degree of difference between them grows as they are subjected to increasingly different environments.  For example, one might take up smoking, or one might have a job outdoors and the other a desk job.  This will cause changes in the methylation status of the DNA. In order to carry our speedy, inexpensive analysis of this, Dr Williams and his team propose a technique named  high resolution melt curve analysis  (HRMA).  What HRMA does is to subject the DNA to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break, known as the melting temperature.  The more hydrogen bonds that are present in the DNA, the higher the temperature required to melt them,  explains Dr Williams.  Consequently, if one DNA sequence is more methylated than the other, then the melting temperatures of the two samples will differ   a difference that can be measured, and which will establish the difference between two identical twins.  HRMA has some limitations, acknowledges Dr Williams.  For example young twins, or twins raised in highly similar environments may not have yet developed sufficient methylation differences. Also the technique requires a high sample quantity that might not be present at the crime scene.  Nevertheless, we have demonstrated substantial progress towards a relatively cheap and quick test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work,  says Dr Williams, who gives a detailed summary of the science behind the breakthrough at blog-site The Conversation.","Published: May 11, 2015"

The researchers, from The University. of Western Australia and Queensland, have unraveled the manufacturing route sunflowers use to make a super-stable protein ring. The enzyme at the heart of the synthesis, AEP, has been shown to have evolved a second ability not only can AEP cut proteins, but some also have an unusual ability to join them together. By using artificial proteins that mimic the parent molecule of a drug-like protein from sunflower seeds the team, led by UWA, have discovered some AEP enzymes can convert parent molecular  string  into a small, stable  bracelet-like  protein ring. They also discovered a degrading pathway that cleans up any misprocessing and makes the process 100% efficient in sunflower seeds. Although this work is of interest to researchers by providing an understanding of how protein machinery can stabilize proteins, it also provides a starting point for making custom enzymes that can join proteins together. The study was published in Chemistry & Biology. The article shows how the enzyme AEP (Asparaginyl Endo-Peptidase) is needed to create a small circular protein in sunflower seeds. ""You can find AEP enzymes in all plants where they defend plants from pathogens and mature seed store proteins, but in sunflower AEP appears to have specialized to produce a small cyclic peptide that we think protects the seeds from insects,"" said lead author, UWA's Dr. Kalia Bernath-Levin. ""The way AEP does this is really interesting. Enzymes can accelerate reactions in both directions, but many reactions go just one way. For example, making a protein bond needs energy and for the two pieces to be held close together. So it's much easier for an enzyme to cut proteins than join them."" ""The reaction isn't really ligation as the energy for that comes from cutting at the same time. It's a mouthful, but we're calling it a cleavage-dependent intramolecular transpeptidation reaction, which basically means a cutting and a ligation reaction happening at the same time makes the critical bond,"" Professor. Joshua Mylne said.

Its metal frame is built up around a stainless steel circle lit by an ultraviolet light. Stainless steel hydraulics and thin black tubes line the back edge, which lead to an inner, topside box made of red plastic. In front, the metal is etched with the red Bio Bot logo. All together, the gray metal frame is small enough to fit on top of an old-fashioned school desk, but nothing about this 3D printer is old school. In fact, the tissue-printing machine is more like a sci-fi future in the flesh and it has very real medical applications. Researchers at Michigan Technological University hope to use this newly acquired 3D bioprinter to make synthesized nerve tissue. The key is developing the right  bioink  or printable tissue. The nanotechnology-inspired material could help regenerate damaged nerves for patients with spinal cord injuries, says Tolou Shokuhfar, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering at Michigan Tech. Shokuhfar directs the In-Situ Nanomedicine and Nanoelectronics Laboratory at Michigan Tech, and she is an adjunct assistant professor in the Bioengineering Department and the College of Dentistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In the bioprinting research, Shokuhfar collaborates with Reza Shahbazian-Yassar, the Richard and Elizabeth Henes Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics at Michigan Tech. Shahbazian-Yassar s highly interdisciplinary background on cellulose nanocrystals as biomaterials, funded by the National Science Foundation s (NSF) Biomaterials Program, helped inspire the lab s new 3D printing research.  Cellulose nanocrystals with extremely good mechanical properties are highly desirable for bioprinting of scaffolds that can be used for live tissues,  says Shahbazian-Yassar.  We wanted to target a big issue,  Shokuhfar says, explaining that nerve regeneration is a particularly difficult biomedical engineering conundrum.  We are born with all the nerve cells we ll ever have, and damaged nerves don t heal very well.  Other facilities are trying to address this issue as well. Many feature large, room-sized machines that have built-in cell culture hoods, incubators and refrigeration. The precision of this equipment allows them to print full organs. But innovation is more nimble at smaller scales.  We can pursue nerve regeneration research with a simpler printer set-up,  says Shayan Shafiee, a PhD student working with Shokuhfar. He gestures to the small gray box across the lab bench. He opens the red box under the top side of the printer s box. Inside the plastic casing, a large syringe holds a red jelly-like fluid. Shafiee replenishes the needle-tipped printer, pulls up his laptop and, with a hydraulic whoosh, he starts to print a tissue scaffold. 3D Bioprinting Nerve Cells This May, Marvel released its latest Avengers epic, complete with a 3D printed superhero called The Vision. The android system is printed in a massive 3D printer called The Cradle and is a tribute to both current science and past fiction. Sci-fi has long dreamed of constructing flesh think of Luke Skywalker s hand or LeeLoo in The Fifth Element but while 3D bioprinting is happening, reality has not quite caught up to that vision. Right now, bioprinting focuses on building up one tissue at a time. At his lab bench in the nanotechnology lab at Michigan Tech, Shafiee holds up a petri dish. Inside is what looks like a red gummy candy, about the size of a half-dollar.  This is based on fractal geometry,  Shafiee explains, pointing out the small crenulations and holes pockmarking the jelly.  These are similar to our vertebrae the idea is to let a nerve pass through the holes.  Making the tissue compatible with nerve cells begins long before the printer starts up. Shafiee says the first step is to synthesize a biocompatible polymer that is syrupy but not too thick that can be printed. That means Shafiee and Shokuhfar have to create their own materials to print with; there is no Amazon.com or even a specialty shop for bioprinting nerves. Nerves don t just need a biocompatible tissue to act as a carrier for the cells. Nerve function is all about electric pulses. This is where Shokuhfar s nanotechnology research comes in: Last year, she was awarded a CAREER grant from NSF for her work using graphene in biomaterials research.  Graphene is a wonder material,  she says.  And it has very good electrical conductivity properties.  The team is extending the application of this material for nerve cell printing.  Our work always comes back to the question, is it printable or not?  Shafiee says, adding that a successful material a biocompatible, graphene-bound polymer may just melt, mush or flat out fail under the pressure of printing. After all, imagine building up a substance more delicate than a souffl  using only the point of a needle. And in the nanotechnology world, a needlepoint is big, even clumsy. Shafiee and Shokuhfar see these issues as mechanical obstacles that can be overcome.  It s like other 3D printers, you need a design to work from,  Shafiee says, adding that he will tweak and hone the methodology for printing nerve cells throughout his dissertation work. He is also hopeful that the material will have use beyond nerve regeneration. Although widespread medical use of bioprinting is probably a decade or two away, in this lab, the future sits on a tabletop in a little gray box.","Published: May 11, 2015"

This next generation of UC Berkeley s CellScope technology could help revive efforts to eradicate debilitating filarial diseases in Africa by providing critical information to health providers in the field.  We previously showed that mobile phones can be used for microscopy, but this is the first device that combines the imaging technology with hardware and software automation to create a complete diagnostic solution,  said Daniel Fletcher, an associate chair and professor of bioengineering, whose UC Berkeley lab pioneered the CellScope.  The video CellScope provides accurate, fast results that enable health workers to make potentially life-saving treatment decisions in the field. A pilot test in Cameroon of CellScope Loa, a mobile phone-based video microscope developed by a UC Berkeley-led team, found that the device was as good as conventional blood smears in detecting levels of the Loa loa parasitic worm. (Image courtesy of NIAID) The UC Berkeley engineers teamed up with Dr. Thomas Nutman from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and collaborators from Cameroon and France to develop the device. They conducted a pilot study in Cameroon, where health officials have been battling the parasitic worm diseases onchocerciasis (river blindness) and lymphatic filariasis. The video CellScope, which uses motion instead of molecular markers or fluorescent stains to detect the movement of worms, was as accurate as conventional screening methods, the researchers found. The results of the pilot study are reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.  This research is addressing neglected tropical diseases,  said Fletcher.  It demonstrates what technology can do to help fill a void for populations that are suffering from terrible, but treatable, diseases.  Battling parasitic worms River blindness is transmitted through the bite of blackflies and is the second-leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. Lymphatic filariasis, spread by mosquitoes, leads to elephantiasis, a condition marked by painful, disfiguring swelling. It is the second-leading cause of disability worldwide and, like river blindness, is highly endemic in certain regions in Africa. The antiparasitic drug ivermectin, or IVM, can be used to treat these diseases, but mass public health campaigns to administer the medication have been stalled because of potentially fatal side effects for patients co-infected with Loa loa, which causes loiasis, or African eye worm. When there are high circulating levels of microscopic Loa loa worms in a patient, treatment with IVM can potentially lead to severe or fatal brain or other neurologic damage. The standard method of screening for levels of Loa loa involves trained technicians manually counting the worms in a blood smear using conventional laboratory microscopes, making the process impractical for use in field settings and in mass campaigns to administer IVM. The serious side effects of Loa loa and the difficulty of rapidly quantifying Loa levels in patients before treatment make it too risky to broadly administer IVM, representing a major setback in the efforts to eradicate river blindness and elephantiasis. Next generation CellScope uses video, automation For this latest generation of the mobile phone microscope, named CellScope Loa, the researchers paired a smartphone with a 3D-printed plastic base where the sample of blood is positioned. The base included LED lights, microcontrollers, gears, circuitry and a USB port. Control of the device is automated through an app the researchers developed for this purpose. With a single touch of the screen by the healthcare worker, the phone communicates wirelessly via Bluetooth to controllers in the base to process and analyze the sample of blood. Gears move the sample in front of the camera, and an algorithm automatically analyzes the telltale  wriggling  motion of the worms in video captured by the phone. The worm count is then displayed on the screen. Fletcher said previous field tests revealed that automation helped reduce the rate of human error. The procedure takes about two minutes or less, starting from the time the sample is inserted to the display of the results. Pricking a finger and loading the blood onto the capillary adds another minute to the time. The short processing time allows health workers to quickly determine on site whether it is safe to administer IVM.  The availability of a point-of-care test prior to drug treatment is a major advance in the control of these debilitating diseases,  said aquatic ecologist Vincent Resh, a professor in UC Berkeley s Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management.  The research offering a phone-based app is ingenious, practical and highly needed.  Resh, who is not involved in the CellScope project, has worked in West Africa for 15 years on the control of onchocerciasis. The researchers are now expanding the study of CellScope Loa to about 40,000 people in Cameroon. Co-lead authors of the study are Michael D Ambrosio, UC Berkeley research scientist in bioengineering, and Matthew Bakalar, UC Berkeley graduate student in bioengineering.

It is a discovery that will help accelerate the process of developing better and gentler cancer treatments. The discovery has just been described in an article in the renowned scientific journal, Science. When DNA is damaged, several different proteins start pouring in to repair the damage; their types depend on the damage done. Up until now, it has been common practice to study one protein at a time, but by way of so-called mass spectrometry, researchers are now able to simultaneously see all the proteins that help repair damaged DNA. Clearer picture This method, which can be utilized by researchers worldwide, has been developed by the German Max-Planck Institute in Munich, headed by Professor Matthias Mann, who is also affiliated with the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, in the capacity of Research Director at CPR Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology in close collaboration with Niels Mailand s team at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Protein Research (CPR). The new technique has tremendous potential, because today, much cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, is aimed at inducing massive DNA damage in order to kill the cancerous cells. An unwanted side effect though, is that perfectly healthy cells are also damaged. This method enables researchers worldwide to obtain better insight into how and which proteins help repair the DNA.  We get a much clearer and more general picture of the reparatory process, i.e. where previously, we were only able to see one piece of the puzzle at a time, we are now able to see the entire puzzle. And this makes it a lot easier to see what is going on, and then work from there. The better we understand these processes, the better and gentler cancer treatments we can develop , says Niels Mailand. The article in Science describes chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, because the researchers wanted to relate their findings to the treatment of cancer. By using this method, Niels Mailand and his research team have discovered that two specific and hitherto un-described proteins play an important part in repairing damaged DNA.   This new method enables us to quickly get an overview of the entire bag of proteins that are important in terms of repairing damaged DNA. In this process, we have discovered that the two proteins have a specific part to play and attract certain necessary elements to a given spot where DNA-repairs are taking place. In other words, this new technique allows us to put the puzzle together much quicker,  says Niels Mailand, who is close to being able to determine the function of another 5-10 proteins in the DNA damage-response, which have also been located by way of this new technique.","Published: May 11, 2015"

These tiny membrane-bound packages of macromolecules, which include microvesicles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies, can form in one of two ways: intracellularly by invagination of the plasma membrane, or by budding (or shedding) directly from the cell membrane into the extracellular space. Extracellular vesicles are believed to serve as key mediators in the pathogenesis of neurological, vascular, hematological, and autoimmune disease. Moreover, extracellular vesicles are also considered vital intermediaries in cancer processes that contribute to poor disease outcomes, such as metastasis. The translation of extracellular vesicle research to the clinic to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of many disease types will require the development of standard assays for their characterization and quantification. The challenge of such analysis lies in the submicron size (generally 50-1000 nm in diameter) of each vesicle, as well as the complexity of the biofluids in which they are typically suspended. While sensitive enough to resolve tiny cellular particles, high-magnification microscopy is limited by the typical dispersal of microvesicles in biofluids and a lack of quantitative data. Non-imaging flow cytometers can measure objects in suspension, but are generally unable to detect particles less than 400 nm in diameter. In addition, these instruments cannot provide visual confirmation of particle integrity for characterization. As a result of the above-mentioned challenges, efforts to achieve consensus on the analysis of extracellular vesicles are hindered, and concerns about data comparability are being raised within the scientific community. The recent characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles has been achieved, however, using imaging flow cytometry, which suggests a promising role for this technology in the advan Through precise fluid mechanics, ultra-sensitive fluorescence detection, and software engineering that facilitates quantitation and statistical analysis, Amnis imaging flow cytometers (EMD Millipore) overcome the technological barriers that traditional flow cytometers face in the analysis of extracellular vesicles. The enhanced sensitivity of this technology for fluorescence detection has been demonstrated by exceptional resolution of mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cell subpopulations in heterogeneous samples (data not shown). Charge-coupled device (CCD) camera acquisition of fluorescent signal confers increased sensitivity and facilitates the resolution of less common populations. For non-imaging flow cytometry, gating relies on the degree of light scatter and fluorescence intensity, which can result in frequent, inadvertent inclusion of contaminating particles in the presumed extracellular vesicle population. A key feature of imaging flow cytometry, however, is the pairing of fluorescence intensity data with an image for every event collected, providing functionality that allows the user to distinguish true single particles from aggregates and cellular debris. This pairing feature also creates searchable scatter plots and image galleries that can facilitate visual confirmation of fluorescent events. The Amnis ImageStream is equipped with a 60X objective, which allows for the detection and characterization of extracellular microparticles. The barriers to resolving individual microvesicles in biofluids are addressed by exceptionally precise hydrodynamic focusing, which reliably segregates extracellular vesicles as individual acquisition events. The CCD-based detection has been validated for the detection and analysis of submicron particles that are significantly smaller than the 400-500 nm threshold demonstrated by even the most sensitive photomultiplier (PMT)-based cytometers using fluorescent intensity scatter plots and images of FITC-conjugated beads. In addition, isolated and cell-bound fluorescently labeled exosomes have been detected using this technology, and the degree of internalization of exosomes measured using the software internalization feature  Moreover, the acquisition software automatically records the event count and volume acquired per sample. The number of extracellular vesicles per  L can therefore be displayed without the need for costly and/or laborious optical, electron microscopy, or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based methods. This capability also addresses the recommendations of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles regarding the standardization and reduction of workflow in extracellular vesicle preparations, collection, and analysis. Finally, sample volume and preparation time are greatly reduced. Vesicles, cells, and beads in heterogeneous suspension can be differentiated by side-scatter and morphology characteristics, thereby eliminating the need for extracellular vesicle isolation prior to flow acquisition. Taken together, these innovations in flow cytometry enable a new standard for the consistent detection, quantitation, and characterization of extracellular vesicles. These observations also suggest a promising new role for imaging flow cytometry in the advancement and clinical translation of extracellular vesicle biology.","Published: May 11, 2015"

The region-specific cells we found could provide tremendous advantages in the laboratory to study development, evolution and disease, and may offer avenues for generating novel therapies,  said Salk Professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, senior author of the paper and holder of Salk s Roger Guillemin Chair. The researchers dubbed this new class of cells  region-selective pluripotent stem cells,  or rsPSCs for short. The rsPSCs were easier to grow in the laboratory than conventional human pluripotent stem cells and offered advantages for large-scale production and gene editing (altering a cell s DNA), both desirable features for cell replacement therapies. To produce the cells, the Salk scientists developed a combination of chemical signals that directed human stem cells in a laboratory dish to become spatially oriented. They then inserted the spatially oriented human stem cells (human rsPSCs) into specific regions of partially dissected mouse embryos and cultured them in a dish for 36 hours. Separately, they also inserted human stem cells cultured using conventional methods, so that they could compare existing techniques to their new technique. While the human stem cells derived through conventional methods failed to integrate into the modified embryos, the human rsPSCs began to develop into early stage tissues. The cells in this region of an early embryo undergo dynamic changes to give rise to all cells, tissues and organs of the body. Indeed the human rsPSCs began the process of differentiating into the three major cell layers in early development, known as ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. The Salk researchers stopped the cells from differentiating further, but each germ layer was theoretically capable of giving rise to specific tissues and organs.  Collaborating with the labs of Salk Professors Joseph Ecker and Alan Saghatelian, the Izpisua Belmonte team performed extensive characterization of the new cells and found rsPSCs showed distinct molecular and metabolic characteristics as well as novel epigenetic signatures that is, patterns of chemical modifications to DNA that control which genes are turned on or off without changing the DNA sequence.  The region selective-state of these stem cells is entirely novel for laboratory-cultured stem cells and offers important insight into how human stem cells might be differentiated into derivatives that give rise to a wide range of tissues and organs,  said Jun Wu, a postdoctoral researcher in Izpisua Belmonte s lab and first author of the new paper.  Not only do we need to consider the timing, but also the spatial characteristics of the stem cells. Understanding both aspects of a stem cell s identity could be crucial to generate functional and mature cell types for regenerative medicine. ","Published: May 11, 2015"

During 2014, SYGNIS  focus was on the development of its proprietary product pipeline in the field of molecular diagnostics and DNA tools for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). With the introduction of the new product and commercialization strategy, SYGNIS has strengthened corporate control over the commercialization of its proprietary technology and related products. In addition to the licensing strategy, SYGNIS is now generating revenues through direct sales, non-exclusive distribution agreements and proprietary product launches. Key building blocks of the new strategy were the development of the TruePrime  product line addressing a multitude of applications for the amplification of various DNA or RNA species. The first kits targeting DNA amplification from single cells were launched in January 2015. Global launch of the second product line SunScript  Reverse Transcriptase (RT) followed in April 2015. Operational highlights in 2014:In February 2014, QIAGEN launched the first two products in a series of kits based on SYGNIS  proprietary amplification technology, SensiPhi . The two kits, REPLI-g WTA Single Cell Kit and REPLI-g Cell WGA & WTA Kit are commercialized globally by QIAGEN under an exclusive license agreement with signed in July 2012. In May 2014, SYGNIS announced that it had signed a patent agreement with SYSTASY Bioscience GmbH, a service provider in the drug discovery industry. The transferred IP is part of a broader IP family covering SYGNIS  proprietary Double Switch technology for the qualitative and quantitative detection of interactions between two proteins. SYGNIS still maintains other patents linked to this technology with the aim of signing additional non-exclusive agreements with other companies. In November 2014, SYGNIS introduced its first product family for whole genome amplification. TruePrime  is the brand name of a series of kits dedicated to the amplification of various DNA or RNA species for a multitude of applications. TruePrime  stands for a revolutionary change in the way DNA or RNA is amplified. While the current gold standard MDA (multiple displacement amplification) needs short pieces of DNA ( oligonucleotides ) to start off the amplification, TruePrime  does not need any synthetic random primers. The first TruePrime  kits were launched in January 2015. In December, SYGNIS granted BioCat GmbH non-exclusive rights to promote, market, sell, and support TruePrime  Single Cell WGA kit for the DNA amplification of single cells for NGS applications. Also in December 2014, SYGNIS successfully completed a capital increase and raised gross proceeds of  4.95 million by issuing 2,475,678 new shares. The company is using the proceeds to further expand its proprietary product portfolio and finance operating activities until break-even, which is expected in 2016. Pilar de la Huerta, CEO and CFO of SYGNIS, commented:  The year 2014 was marked by the transition of SYGNIS from a technology licensing player to a product company. With the launch of our first proprietary product lines, TruePrime  and SunScript  at the beginning of this year, we have executed our new strategy and paved the ground for future growth. In parallel, we have set up our sales and marketing capacities, promoted our own products and signed a series of important distribution agreements with leading industry partners in Europe, North America and Asia. With our broad portfolio of proprietary technologies and products, we believe we are best positioned to benefit from the growth of industrial Next Generation Sequencing and single cell analysis applications in personalized medicine, molecular diagnostics and drug development.  Fiscal year 2014:In the financial year 2014, the operating result (EBIT) amounted to -  3.2 million (2013: -  4.3 million) as operating expenses have been reduced. However, the reported net loss for the period was   3.5 million (2013:   3.2 million), primarily as the tax income on tax losses carry-forwards from the previous year omitted. Revenues for the fiscal year 2014 amounted to   0.4 million (2013:   0.5 million), and are primarily attributable to the Caco-2 licensing rights in the USA, an upfront payment for the product Double Switch, the exclusive license agreement with QIAGEN and services rendered by the Company. Excluding the upfront payment received in 2013 for the non-exclusive license agreement signed with QIAGEN in 2013, the regular revenues of the Company showed a growth tendency. Total operating expenses have decreased to   3.6 million compared to the previous year (2013:   4.8 million). This development is mainly due to lower R&D costs of   1.4 million (2013:   2.2 million) following the new strategy, and lower impairment losses of   0.3 million (2013:   0.6 million). Total assets rose to   12.5 million in 2014 compared to   11.3 million in 2013, primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents by   1.6 million as a result of the successful capital increase in December 2014. Cash outflow from operating activities in 2014 remained unchanged at   3.6 million. Cash outflow from investing activities was   0.6 million (2013:   0.1 million), Cash flow from financing activities was   5.5 million (2013:   5.5 million), mainly resulting from the inflow from the capital increases of   5.9 million (less costs of issuing equity of   0.5 million). In the previous year it included cash inflows from new loans amounting to  2.7 million, next to the capital increase of  2.8 million. The Company s liquidity level has significantly improved as of 31 December 2014 and increased to   3.8 million compared to   2.2 million in the previous year. Outlook 2015Revenues in the fiscal year 2015 are dependent on the market launch success of the first proprietary DNA amplification kits and on revenue growth arising from the license agreement with QIAGEN for additional products based on QualiPhi. Furthermore, SYGNIS expects first revenues from the out-licensing of Double Switch. Depending on the success of these commercialization activities, revenues in 2015 are forecasted in the range of approximately   0.7 million, with a strong upside potential in 2016. In 2015, expenditure for Research & Development is expected to decrease as SYGNIS is focusing in product development instead of basic research. On the other hand, marketing and commercial expenses are projected to increase due to the commercialization and production of our own kits. Administration expenses will remain level of 2014. The Company expects net losses to be significantly lower than in 2014. As a result of the successful capital increase in December 2014, cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2014 amounted to   3.8 million. With these financial resources and the expected cash inflows during 2015 SYGNIS possesses sufficient liquidity until break-even is reached, which is expected to be in 2016.","Published: May 9, 2015"

The study, published in Hearing Research, found that locating an object by listening to echoes, without moving the head, requires good hearing at high frequencies and in both ears. This builds on research published in 2013 by the team at the University s Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) that demonstrated conclusively that some sighted and blind people could use echoes in this way. What wasn t clear until now was how important high-frequency hearing in both ears is. Dr Daniel Rowan, lead author of the study, says:  We know that hearing echoes is very important in daily life for some blind people. Hearing loss, such as associated with getting older, usually reduces hearing at high frequencies in both ears. Some people can develop deafness in one ear. We wanted to get some insight into how much those particular forms of hearing loss might affect users of echoes to locate objects: our results suggest they would struggle.  The researchers conducted a series of experiments with both sighted and blind people. In their most recent experiment, sighted people were asked if an object (in this case a flat MDF board) was to the left or right of them. The experiment used a  virtual auditory space  technique originally created in ISVR s anechoic chamber, one of the quietest places on Earth, but reproduced for the participants over special earphones. This method allowed the researchers to remove audio and non-audio clues to the location of the object that are unrelated to echoes, such as the sounds and air movement associated with positioning the object. Sounds were manipulated in various ways, simulating high-frequency hearing loss and single-sided deafness, as well as to check carefully that people were not finding cunning ways to use the echoes with one ear. People could locate the object accurately but only if they had good high-frequency hearing and in both ears. Dr Rowan adds:  Hearing aid services tend to focus on how well a person can hear speech. Our research indicates that those services also need to take into account whether someone needs to hear echoes in their daily life. For example, they might need hearing aids in both ears, despite the emerging trend in some parts of the country to only fit one.  This work is currently being extended to detecting objects and using head movement to improve the localization of objects. Initial results suggest a similar conclusion. A web-app will be launched later in the year for the public to try out the team s experiments themselves and see if they can  make like a bat  too.

To address this, researchers at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center identified a promising combinatorial approach to treating glioblastomas, the most common form of primary brain cancer. The study, published in Oncotarget, demonstrates that a mouse model of glioblastoma and human glioblastoma tissue removed from patients and cultured in the lab can be effectively treated by combining three classes of anti-cancer drugs: a drug that targets a cancer mutation in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene, a drug that increases stress in cancer cells and a drug that damages cancer cell DNA.  Developing therapies against glioblastoma is like a chess game. For each therapy administered, or move, by the physician, the cancer makes a counter-move,  said senior author Clark Chen, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurosurgery and vice-chair of Research and Academic Development at UC San Diego. In up to 50 percent of glioblastomas, mutations in the EGFR gene render cancer cells insensitive to growth regulation by environmental cues, allowing them to grow uncontrollably. Yet highly specific EGFR inhibitors are not particularly effective against glioblastomas with EGFR mutations.  When glioblastoma cells are treated with EGFR inhibitors, they turn on another receptor to bypass the need for EGFR,  said Chen.  Any hope of an effective treatment requires a combination of moves strategically designed for a checkmate.  To develop such a strategy, Chen and his group turned to PLK1, a protein that regulates stress levels within glioblastoma cells and is essential for their survival. Chen and his group found that glioblastoma cells that developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors remain universally dependent on this protein. In mouse models of glioblastoma and in explants of human glioblastoma, singular treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, a PLK1 inhibitor or the current standard of care drug (a DNA-damaging agent), each temporarily halted glioblastoma growth. But, like the human disease, the tumor eventually grew back. However, no detectable tumor recurrence was observed when a combination of all three classes of drugs was administered. The treated mice tolerated this combination regimen without showing significant side-effects.  It is often assumed that if we find the cancer-causing mutation and inhibit the function of that mutation, we will be able to cure cancer,  said study co-author Bob S. Carter, MD, PhD, chief of neurosurgery at UC San Diego.  Our study demonstrates that the reality is far more complex. Our results provide a blueprint for how to leverage fundamental biologic concepts to tackle this challenging complexity.  The three drugs administered to mice in this study were: BI2536, a PLK1 inhibitor; Gefitnib, an EGFR inhibitor; and TMZ, the standard-of-care chemotherapy for glioblastoma. The study authors note that while the safety or side effects of treating human patients will all three drugs is unknown, all are individually well-tolerated in humans. The clinical safety profiles of Gefitinib and TMZ are well-established for glioblastoma patients and PLK1 inhibitors have so far been well-tolerated in clinical trials (one has advanced to Phase III clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia).

But before the reflex can work, the wirelike projections, or axons, of specialized nerve cells must find their way from the retina to the correct part of the brain during embryonic development. New research, published online in the journal Neuron, describes how those axons find their way through the brain s maze of neurons to make the right connection. The finding has implications for treatment of eye movement disorders and regeneration of damaged vision-sensing nerve cells.  Without our even knowing it, our eyes are constantly making small movements to keep our vision from getting blurry as we move our heads or as our field of vision moves like when we re in a moving car,  says Alex Kolodkin, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.  Our eyes know which adjustments to make, because specialized cells in the retina convey direction specific information to the brain, which then directs appropriate eye movements to compensate. Now we have a better understanding of how the axons from these neurons get to where they need to be.  The neurons in question are a type of direction-sensitive ganglion cell found in the retina. Each subset of these neurons is in charge of monitoring movements in different directions: vertical, horizontal, forward and backward. For this study, Kolodkin and his group focused on the cells that specifically report slow vertical movement to the brain, like what one would experience looking straight ahead while riding a Ferris wheel. Recent work from another group showed that these cells connect their axons to an area of the brain called the medial terminal nucleus (MTN), but no one knew how they got there during development. For years, Kolodkin and his group have been studying how nerve cell axons get to where they need to be. As part of this work, they discovered a group of guidance cue proteins called semaphorins (Semas). Knowing from their previous work that the protein Sema6A is required for related connections in the visual system, they started by looking for Sema6A in their vertically sensitive cells. After Lu Sun, Ph.D., the first author of the study, found that it was indeed present on the membranes of the cells, he genetically deleted it in mice to assess its function. The mice showed normal development of the cells during early embryonic development, but the axons couldn t recognize when they reached their target in the brain, so they retracted, leaving the mice unable to appropriately adjust their eyes as they viewed vertically moving stripes. If Sema6A was helping guide the axons, there had to be some sort of  bait  in the target region of the brain that the cells could recognize to establish a connection. The Sema6A protein usually interacts with a different class of protein called plexins, so the team looked for plexin proteins in the MTN region of the brain, verifying that they re there and not in other nearby regions. But something was curious about this.  Normally, Sema6A acts as a bait for plexins,  says Kolodkin.  Not the other way around.  To find whether the plexins were actually working as bait in this scenario, the team genetically removed them from the retinal neurons while maintaining normal levels of Sema6A. If the axons needed the plexins to guide them to their target, they would fail. But they didn t: The plexins in the MTN were sufficient to coax the Sema6A-laden axons home. This means that Sema6A acts as a receptor on the cells, recognizing plexins in the target region to allow circuits to be formed, explains Kolodkin. The researchers hope their work will help us understand eye movement disorders and nerve regeneration. Specifically, their setup using moving stripes and infrared light to monitor eye movement can be used to show whether vision can be restored in mice where nerve regeneration is required following eye injury. In the future, they also plan to study how these circuits ultimately wire up the muscles that control eye movement. Johns Hopskins Medicine   press release Lu O. Sun, Colleen M.
