CARs are artificially created immune T cells that have been engineered to produce receptors on their surface that are designed to target and kill specific cells containing viruses or tumor proteins. Chimeric receptors are the focus of ongoing research into how gene immunotherapy can be used to fight cancer. But they could also be used to create a strong immune response against HIV, said Dr. Otto Yang, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the study s corresponding author. Although the human body s immune system does initially respond to, and attack, HIV, the sheer onslaught of the virus   its ability to hide in different T cells and to rapidly replicate   eventually wears out and destroys the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to a host of infections and diseases. Researchers have been looking for ways to strengthen the immune system against HIV, and it now appears CARs could be a weapon in that fight.  We took new generation antibodies and engineered them as artificial T-cell receptors, to reprogram killer T cells to kill HIV-infected cells,  said Yang, who is also director of vaccine and pathogenesis research at the AIDS Institute and Center for AIDS Research.  Others have used antibodies against cancer antigens to make artificial T-cell receptors against cancer and shown this to be helpful in cancer treatment.   UCLA is the first to design this strategy for HIV. While the receptors approach has been in use for almost 10 years to fight cancer, this is the first attempt to use the technique to treat HIV since 15 years ago, when experiments proved unsuccessful. The new research differs because it takes advantage of new antibodies that have been discovered in the past few years. In the previous trials, researchers had used an early type that was not antibody-based. That approach, however, was abandoned because it was clinically ineffective. Here the researchers used seven recently discovered  broadly neutralizing antibodies  that have the ability to bind multiple strains of invading viruses, unlike earlier isolated antibodies that tend to bind few strains. These antibodies were re-engineered as artificial CAR-T cell receptors to have activity against broad strains of HIV. In lab tests, the researchers found that all seven had varying degrees of ability to direct killer T cells to proliferate, kill and suppress viral replication in response to HIV-infected cells. Yang notes that  what works in a test tube doesn t necessarily work in a person,  so the next step is to find strategies to put these receptors into humans. But this therapy shows enough promise to move forward with further research.","Published: July 19, 2016"

The creation of this spin-off has also been made possible thanks to the Bosch i Gimpera Foundation of the University of Barcelona and the Catalan Institute for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). The creation and launch of the company has been driven by the Bot n Foundation, whose technology transfer programme has provided one of the research groups involved support and assessment over five years. Furthermore, the Bot n Foundation has invested half a million euros of start-up capital in Nostrum BioDiscovery through its Mind the Gap Programme, which backs early-stage entrepreneurial projects. Market opportunity in drug development Nostrum BioDiscovery will significantly speed up and increase the accuracy of the studies done prior to the commercialisation of pharmaceuticals and biotechnological products. The company specialises in cutting-edge informatics tools, computing power, and research of excellence. The services provided by Nostrum BioDiscovery could imply savings equivalent to about 40 million euros per new pharmaceutical product; this figure corresponds to between 15 and 20% less expense in the initial development phase, which involves an estimated investment of around  300 million  There are no easy drugs left to be discovered. The number of drugs being launched each year is falling and these are incredibly expensive. Computational simulation cannot perform miracles, but it can significantly reduce the drug development process by increasing therapeutic strength, which has a positive effect on the entire development process,  says Modesto Orozco, IRB Barcelona researcher, full professor of the University of Barcelona and president of Nostrum BioDiscovery. The company has come about in the context of a transformation of the pharmaceutical industry business model, which is moving from drug discovery ""in-house"" to a model that involves partially subcontracting research and development.  The quality of our technologies and the expertise of the team make us a valid and reliable option for companies that want to speed up the initial stages of drug design and to gain efficiency,  comments V ctor Guallar, a scientist at the BSC-CNS, co-leader of the project, and also director of the Scientific Advisory Board of Nostrum BioDiscovery. A vote of confidence from Mind the Gap Through its Mind the Gap Programme, the Bot n Foundation seeks to bridge the gap between science and the company to ensure that  highly innovative and viable research reaches the market and eventually benefits patients,  explained  igo S ez de Miera, director general of the foundation, during the presentation of the Nostrum BioDiscovery. The Bot n Foundation is currently supporting the work of 28 scientists in Spain. It has achieved 48 patents and 27 agreements with companies, in addition to providing employment opportunities for 447 young researchers and technicians. Nostrum BioDiscovery is the fifth company to be backed by this initiative. The companies covered by Mind the Gap have generated 25 direct jobs, most of which are highly qualified, and achieved a turnover of more than 600,000   in 2015. The official presentation of the company was attended by the following: Mar a Luisa Casta o, director general of Research, Development and Innovation Policies of the Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness; the Secretary of State for Universities, Arcadi Navarro; and the Director  General of Research, Francesc Subirada, on the part of the Catalan Government; the directors of IRB Barcelona and the BSC-CNS, Joan J.

The research suggests that the thread-based diagnostic platform could be an effective substrate for a new generation of implantable diagnostic devices and smart wearable systems. The researchers used a variety of conductive threads that were dipped in physical and chemical sensing compounds and connected to wireless electronic circuitry to create a flexible platform that they sutured into tissue in rats as well as in vitro. The threads collected data on tissue health (e.g. pressure, stress, strain and temperature), pH and glucose levels that can be used to determine such things as how a wound is healing, whether infection is emerging, or whether the body s chemistry is out of balance. The results were transmitted wirelessly to a cell phone and computer. The three-dimensional platform is able to conform to complex structures such as organs, wounds or orthopedic implants. While more study is needed in a number of areas, including investigation of long-term biocompatibility, researchers said initial results raise the possibility of optimizing patient-specific treatments.  The ability to suture a thread-based diagnostic device intimately in a tissue or organ environment in three dimensions adds a unique feature that is not available with other flexible diagnostic platforms,  said Sameer Sonkusale, Ph.D., corresponding author on the paper and director of the interdisciplinary Nano Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Tufts School of Engineering.  We think thread-based devices could potentially be used as smart sutures for surgical implants, smart bandages to monitor wound healing, or integrated with textile or fabric as personalized health monitors and point-of-care diagnostics.  Until now, the structure of substrates for implantable devices has essentially been two-dimensional, limiting their usefulness to flat tissue such as skin, according to the paper. Additionally, the materials in those substrates are expensive and require specialized processing.  By contrast, thread is abundant, inexpensive, thin and flexible, and can be easily manipulated into complex shapes,  said Pooria Mostafalu, Ph.D., first author on the paper who was a doctoral student at Tufts when he worked on the project and is now a postdoctoral research fellow with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Brigham and Women s Hospital, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.  Additionally, analytes can be delivered directly to tissue by using thread s natural wicking properties. ","Published: July 19, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/development-in-preventing-macular-degeneration-192317,Development in Preventing Macular Degeneration Following macular degeneration insight  promising drugs to prevent vision loss have been identified  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a University of Wisconsin Madison research team pinpoints how immune abnormalities beneath the retina result in macular degeneration, a common condition that often causes blindness. Aparna Lakkaraju, an assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences, focused on two protective mechanisms that are compromised during the gradual onset of macular degeneration, which degrades and can destroy the central vision needed to read and recognize faces. In tests in a mouse model of macular degeneration, drugs that are already on the market prevented damage to the cells that sustain the light-sensitive cells in the eyes.  These studies raise the possibility of treatments that could slow or prevent macular degeneration,  says Lakkaraju. Macular degeneration destroys central vision in about 2 million Americans, mainly among the elderly, and is largely untreatable. Although macular degeneration eventually damages or kills the light-sensitive rods and cones, Lakkaraju explains that it starts with injury to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE, a single layer of cells beneath the rods and cones at the back of the eye, performs many functions essential for healthy vision. The damage starts with a disturbance of immune proteins called complement, which normally kill disease-causing organisms by boring holes in their cell membranes.  The light-detecting cells in the retina are totally dependent on the RPE for survival,  says Lakkaraju,  but the RPE cells are not replaced through the lifespan. So we asked,  What are the innate protective mechanisms that keep the RPE healthy, and how do they go awry in macular degeneration?'  In a study performed with colleagues Li Xuan Tan and Kimberly Toops, Lakkaraju focused on two protective mechanisms: the protein CD59, which regulates complement activity when attached to the outside of RPE cells; and lysosomes, spherical structures that plug pores created by the complement attack (a function that Lakkaraju s team first detected in the RPE). Together, they offer an in-depth defence, Lakkaraju says.  CD59 prevents the final step of attack that forms the pore,  Lakkaraju says.  Once a pore forms, the cell can move a lysosome to close it.   These studies raise the possibility of treatments that could slow or prevent macular degeneration.  If the complement attack is not defeated, the opening in the RPE cell membrane allows the entry of calcium ions, which spark a long-term, low-grade inflammation that inhibits both protective mechanisms, creating a vicious cycle of destruction. The inflammation in the RPE damages mitochondria, structures that process energy inside all cells. This could eventually lead to a decline or death of the photoreceptor cells, once they are deprived of their essential housekeepers. The result is the loss of central, high-resolution vision. Lakkaraju pursued her research in RPE cells isolated from pig eyes, and in mice that lack a protein   a deficiency that causes an inherited form of macular degeneration called Stargardt disease. Crucially, her study identified an enzyme that is activated by excess cholesterol in the RPE, which neutralizes both protective mechanisms, and found that drugs used to treat depression neutralized that enzyme and restored the protection   and the health of RPE cells   in the mouse model.  I am realistic, but hopeful, that better knowledge of this disease process could be the key.  Epidemiological studies by Ronald and Barbara Klein, also at the UW Madison Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences in the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, have linked long-term use of some of the same drugs with a decreased susceptibility to macular degeneration. The drugs that helped restore protections in the RPE were chosen for their ability to remove excess cholesterol or inhibit aSMase, an enzyme involved in the toxic process, Lakkaraju says.  There are several FDA-approved drugs that inhibit aSMase. We found that the antidepressant desipramine, administered to mice in their drinking water, restored CD59 on the cell surface, decreased reactive oxygen species, and prevented mitochondrial fragmentation.  My lab is interested in the earliest stages of macular degeneration, because we cannot reverse the loss of RPE and photoreceptors,  Lakkaraju says. A patent application for the idea of preventing macular degeneration by blocking aSMase has been filed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Given the likely increase in macular degeneration among an aging population, and the current lack of alternatives,  we hope a pharmaceutical company will license this process and start the necessary preclinical and clinical trials,  Lakkaraju says.  The epidemiological data are there, and now we have fairly convincing mouse data. The safety profiles of these drugs have been documented for decades. There is certainly no guarantee of success, but we need a way to prevent macular degeneration. I am realistic, but hopeful, that better knowledge of this disease process could be the key.

Researchers expect that this likely has an impact for how plants reproduce, and they suggest that plants have evolved over time to take advantage of it. Variation impact Scientists already knew that variation in shape, size and colour of individual flowers can influence how their pollen is spread by visiting insects or birds. They were interested to learn how the arrangement of flowers   such as circled around the stem or in a line   affects pollination. Bee flights Scientists from the University of Edinburgh and the University of Calgary, Canada, studied the flights of bumble bees as they collected nectar from wild tall larkspur flowers in Alberta, Canada. They found that when the plants  flowers were present on only one side of the stem, bees would more often fly vertically between flowers. By comparison, when a plant had flowers all around its stem, bees would be less likely to fly upwards. High yields The findings are helping to aid scientists  understanding of how plants can control how their pollen is spread by foraging insects. They could also inform the development of plant crops with high yields, by enabling scientists to understand how plants can transfer pollen most efficiently. The results may also help explain why about half of all flowering plants produce flowers that can have female or male characteristics at different times. These arrangements may maximise the plants  chances of reproduction. The study, published in the Annals of Botany, was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. Plants and their flowers exist in all shapes and sizes, and our finding that the arrangement of flowers can influence how bees forage might go some way to explaining how plants, which rely on others species to spread pollen, can influence their own reproduction.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/liquid-biopsies-dna-size-matters-199787,Liquid Biopsies  DNA Size Matters Study finds circulating tumour DNA can be distinguished from healthy DNA through fragment size identification  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The liquid biopsy, a new type of blood test for detecting and monitoring cancer, is a welcome reprieve from typical biopsies. The minimally invasive test could reduce the need for the sometimes painful and risky procedures involved in sampling tumours, particularly those that reside deep within the body. However, thus far, the utility of the test has been limited by its sensitivity, particularly in its detection of solid tumours that have not yet metastasized. A study led by the University of Utah School of Medicine reports an advance that could directly increase the sensitivity of liquid biopsies. Liquid biopsies work by detecting pieces of DNA from tumours that are shed into the blood. But so-called circulating tumour DNA can be difficult to pick out amidst abundant circulating DNA from healthy cells. Published on July 18 in PLOS Genetics, the study demonstrates that the fragments of circulating tumour and healthy DNA in cancer patients are different sizes, a property that can be exploited to distinguish between the two types of DNA.  This development has the potential to enable earlier detection of solid tumours through a simple blood draw by substantially improving our ability to detect very low quantities of circulating DNA derived from tumour cells,  says corresponding author and assistant professor of paediatrics Hunter Underhill, M.D., Ph.D. He initiated the research while in the lab of senior author Jay Shendure, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in genome sciences at the University of Washington. Collaborators also include Mary Bronner, M.D., a professor in the department of pathology at the U of U, and at ARUP Laboratories. The size difference between tumour and healthy circulating DNA was initially discovered in animal tumour models created by creating tumours from human cancer cells. In a model of glioblastoma, a brain cancer that does not metastasize outside of the brain, they could readily see that the length of circulating tumour DNA was smaller than healthy DNA by 20-50 base pairs. This size difference was then confirmed in an animal model of liver cancer indicating the size difference may be present in more than one type of tumour. However, it was unclear at this stage in their research if this was a species-specific finding limited to animal tumour models or if this was a biologic phenomenon that may also be present in cancer patients. In a following step, the investigators then compared circulating DNA from melanoma patients to that from healthy volunteers. They found that their observations from animal models held true in that the average length of all the DNA pieces present in the blood from melanoma patients was 20-50 base pairs shorter compared to the DNA pieces in blood from healthy volunteers. Upon sequencing the DNA, they found that DNA fragments containing mutated genes   markers of tumours   were typically smaller than healthy versions of the gene from within the same patient. The results suggested that circulating tumour DNA is more likely to be shorter than circulating healthy DNA. Therefore, Underhill explains, selecting for pieces that are smaller in size should enrich for DNA that comes from tumours. If a person carries them, separation of specific DNA fragments based on size should make them easier to see   similar to reducing the size of the haystack without removing or changing the size of the needle. To test the notion, the scientists examined DNA from four lung cancer patients, isolating fragments that were 20-50 base pairs shorter than the total average size in circulation. Doing so increased the proportion of tumour to healthy DNA by 2.5 to 9-fold. The approach was most successful in making a difference in samples from the two patients in which the smaller-sized tumour DNA was not readily apparent, which may represent patients with low tumour burden and previously difficult to detect circulating tumour DNA.  It s possible that jump in sensitivity could make the difference between being able to detect a cancer, and not,  says Underhill. Together, the findings support the idea that sorting for smaller DNA fragment size could increase the sensitivity of liquid biopsies for tracking many different types of cancers  The size difference demonstrated by our study is a critical step in the evolution of circulating tumour DNA testing,  adds Bronner.  We are now developing methods to better extract the circulating tumour DNA, taking advantage of this size difference, to further advance in this exciting new realm of molecular oncology.

They also identify a drug that may be able to block it. The virus has two potential routes to the developing fetus: a placental route established in the first trimester, and a route across the amniotic sac that only becomes available in the second trimester, according to the study, published Monday, July 18, 2016, in Cell Host & Microbe. The study of human tissue in the laboratory found that an older generation antibiotic called duramycin blocked the virus from replicating in cells that are thought to transmit it along both routes.  Very few viruses reach the fetus during pregnancy and cause birth defects,  said Lenore Pereira, PhD, a virologist and professor of cell and tissue biology in the UCSF School of Dentistry.  Understanding how some viruses are able to do this is a very significant question and may be the most essential question for thinking about ways to protect the fetus when the mother gets infected.  Duramycin is an antibiotic that bacteria produce to fight off other bacteria. It is commonly used in animals and is in clinical trials for people with cystic fibrosis. Recent studies have shown it to be effective in cell culture experiments against dengue and West Nile virus, which are flaviviruses like Zika, as well as filoviruses, like Ebola.  Our paper shows that duramycin efficiently blocks infection of numerous placental cell types and intact first-trimester human placental tissue by contemporary strains of Zika virus recently isolated from the current outbreak in Latin America, where Zika virus infection during pregnancy has been associated with microcephaly and other congenital birth defects,  said Eva Harris, PhD, a professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.  This indicates that duramycin or similar drugs could effectively reduce or prevent transmission of Zika virus from mother to fetus across both potential routes and prevent associated birth defects.  The virus infects several different placental cell types when examined in isolated cells and as intact tissue explants. These include cell types within the placenta and outside the placenta in the fetal membranes. The scientists found that the epithelial cells of the amniotic membrane surrounding the fetus were particularly susceptible to Zika virus infection.   This suggests that these cells play a significant role in mediating transmission to the fetus and supports the hypothesis that transmission could occur across these membranes independently of the placenta, especially in mid and late gestation,  Pereira said.  The most severe birth defects associated with Zika infection   like microcephaly   seem to occur when a woman is infected in the first and second trimester. But there may be a range of lesser but still serious birth defects that occur when a woman is infected later in pregnancy.  Zika virus also uses other receptors, including Axl and Tyro3, which are found in various placental cells. However, the investigators found that only TIM1 was strongly and consistently expressed in placental cell types throughout gestation. TIM1 binds to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a membrane lipid present in the Zika virus envelope that is also present in dengue, West Nile and Ebola. Duramycin, a 19-amino acid cyclic small molecule, binds to PE in the virion envelope, and by doing so it can block these viruses from latching onto the TIM1 receptor to get into cells. The scientists found that duramycin blocked infection of all the placental and fetal membrane cell types they tested, including cytotrophoblasts and amniotic epithelial cells, as well as chorionic villus explants. What s more, the infection was substantially blocked at relatively low concentrations of the drug.","Published: July 19, 2016"

HYD Pharma will apply for ethics approval for additional 5 clinical study sites in 2 other countries by the end of 2016. Scientific results clearly show that the deuterium/hydrogen ratio in cellular water pools and the transfer of their deuterium content to different structural and functional molecules are essential for maintaining normal cell functions, DNA and protein integrity. CLL was chosen upon the consideration, that it is one of the few tumor types, where - according to the treatment protocol - even if the diagnosis is clear, the patients will not receive immediate treatment if the stage of the illness allows it. Patients with asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in early stage (Binet A) who are at high risk of progression and are treatment naive are to be enrolled into the study allowing the investigators to study the effect of deuterium depletion without being influenced by any ongoing conventional therapy. In contrast to the inability to cure CLL with current therapeutic regimens, there are very rare examples of the spontaneous regression of the disease. In 2015, Trigon Biotechnology Inc., strategic partner of HYD Pharma received new GMP compliance certificates for the deuterium-depleted water (DDW) producing facility, and DDW as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient was registered at the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the protocol in the EudraCT system. L szl  G. Boros, MD, (University of California) and G bor Somlyai, chief scientist of HYD Pharma, recently published an article in Medical Hypotheses, titled  Submolecular regulation of cell transformation by deuterium depleting water exchange reactions in the tricarboxylic acid substrate cycle , co-authored by prominent collaborators from Johns Hopkins University; Morsani College of Medicine (University of South Florida) and the University of Arizona Comprehensive Cancer Center. The article identifies deuterium as an oncoisotope, and the new research clarifies how normal cells discriminate against deuterium and how tumor cells lack this process. In June, 2016, Cell Metabolism paper, Comment to the Editor, has been accepted and posted as an Open Access article. G bor Somlyai, president of HYD Pharma Inc. commented:  Achieving the GMP certification and receiving ethical approval are essential elements for the pending phase 2 clinical study, and reflects our continued focus towards deuterium depletion as an additional new tool in oncotherapy.

The spread of the protein, called tau, may explain why only one area of the brain is affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's but multiple areas are affected in later stages of the disease. See Also: PET imaging for tau visualization in the brain ""By learning how tau spreads, we may be able to stop it from jumping from neuron to neuron,"" said Karen Duff, PhD, professor in the department of pathology and cell biology (in the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain) and professor of psychiatry (at New York State Psychiatric Institute). ""This would prevent the disease from spreading to other regions of the brain, which is associated with more severe dementia."" The idea the Alzheimer's can spread through the brain first gained support a few years ago when Duff and other Columbia researchers discovered that tau spread from neuron to neuron through the brains of mice. In the new study, lead scientist Jessica Wu, PhD, a former post-doctoral researcher at the Taub Institute who is currently at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), discovered how tau travels by tracking the movement of tau from one neuron to another. Tau, she found, can be released by neurons into extracellular space, where it can be picked up by other neurons. Because tau can travel long distances within the neuron before its release, it can seed other regions of the brain. ""This finding has important clinical implications,"" explained Dr. Duff. ""When tau is released into the extracellular space, it would be much easer to target the protein with therapeutic agents, such as antibodies, than if it had remained in the neuron."" Don't Miss: Immunotherapy used to reduce memory problems with Alzheimer s disease A second interesting feature of the study is the observation that the spread of tau accelerates when the neurons are more active. Two team members, Abid Hussaini, PhD, and Gustavo Rodriguez, PhD, showed that stimulating the activity of neurons accelerated the spread of tau through the brain of mice and led to more neurodegeneration. Although more work is needed to examine whether those findings are relevant for people, ""they suggest that clinical trials testing treatments that increase brain activity, such as deep brain stimulation, should be monitored carefully in people with neurodegenerative diseases,"" said Dr. Duff.

These electrical signals create tiny magnetic fields, which doctors could use to diagnose various diseases, for example diseases of the brain or heart problems in young foetuses. Researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI) have now succeeded in developing a method for extremely precise measurements of such ultra-small magnetic fields with an optical magnetic field sensor. The results are published in the journal Scientific Reports. See Also: See-through, one-atom-thick, carbon electrodes are a powerful tool for studying epilepsy, other brain disorders, study finds Small magnetic fields from the human body can usually only be picked up by very sensitive superconducting magnetic field sensors that have to be cooled by liquid helium to near absolute zero (which is minus 273 degrees Celsius). But now researchers from the NBI at the University of Copenhagen have developed a much cheaper and more practical optical magnetic field sensor that even works at room temperature or at body temperature. ""The optical magnetic field sensor is based on a gas of caesium atoms in a small glass container. Each caesium atom is equivalent to a small bar magnet, which is affected by external magnetic fields. The atoms and thus the magnetic field are picked up using laser light. The method is based on quantum optics and atomic physics and can be used to measure extremely small magnetic fields,"" explains Kasper Jensen, assistant professor in the Center for Quantum Optics, Quantop at NBI.

On the bottom right is the measured magnetic field, which is generated by the magnetic fields from the electrical impulses that flow through the nerve. Credit: Kasper Jensen, NBI  The researchers at NBI have been developing the sensitive magnetic field sensor for several years in the Quantum research group laboratories. The magnetic field sensor itself consists of a glass container, which has a channel that is approximately 1 cm long and 1 mm wide. At the bottom of the glass container is caesium metal. Caesium evaporates into gas at room temperature and the gas atoms rise up into the small channel in the sensor head. Each caesium atom rotates around itself and the axis is like a tiny bar magnet. Now the sensor is held close to a nerve, which emits an electrical nerve pulse. The electrical pulse has a magnetic field that causes a change in the tilt of the axes of the caesium atoms and by sending a laser beam through the gas, you can read the ultra-small magnetic fields of the nerve signals. The laboratory tests, which were carried out in collaboration with researchers from the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, have shown that you can use the magnetic field sensor to detect the magnetic fields from the electrical impulses from the nervous system. The tests were done on the sciatic nerve from a frog, which in many ways resemble the nerves in the human body. For practical reasons, the nerve was removed from the frog before the tests, but it is also possible to pick up electrical impulses from live frogs or from humans.

""We expect that the sensor will be used for special medical examinations, where it is important for the sensor not to be directly in contact with the body, for example, for diagnosing heart problems in tiny foetuses. Here the magnetic field sensor is placed on the mother's abdomen and you can easily and safely detect the heartbeat of the foetus and you will be able to diagnose any heart problems at an early stage so that the foetus can get the right treatment quickly,"" explains Eugene Polzik, professor and head of Quantop at the Niels Bohr Institute. Don't Miss: Wireless brain sensor could unchain neuroscience from cables Eugene Polzik explains that you can calculate the speed at which the nerve impulses are moving from the measured signals. There are a large number of diseases where the nerves are damaged, for example, multiple scleroses, where the nerve impulses move more slowly than in people who are not ill. Other issues could, for example, be a number of eye diseases where you will be able to make the diagnosis without having to put electrodes on the eye or Alzheimer's, where you will be able to measure the electrical signals in specific nerve pathways.

Colorado State University researchers led by Olve Peersen, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, have designed a genetic modification to one type of coxsackievirus that strips its ability to replicate, mutate and cause illness. They hope their work could lead to a vaccine for this and other viruses like it. The results are published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, and co-authored with Marco Vignuzzi at Paris  Institut Pasteur. Peersen s group seeks to understand the complex biochemical replication machinery of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, a group that includes coxsackievirus, poliovirus, dengue and Zika. For their most recent work, the team focused on the coxsackievirus B3, which causes heart disease. (It is closely related to coxsackie A viruses, which cause hand, foot and mouth disease in children.) Coxsackieviruses have relatively small genomes made of single-stranded RNA. The viral RNA encodes for about a dozen proteins, one of which is the enzyme responsible for making new copies of the virus. Building on previous discoveries In earlier work published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Peersen and co-authors had discovered the exact chemical steps by which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase copies the virus genome. During this process, the polymerase makes three or four random mistakes that allow the virus to continually evolve and survive. The researchers have built upon this breakthrough to design a way to  outsmart Mother Nature,  Peersen said, by re-engineering one key part of the polymerase enzyme so the virus can t grow very rapidly in a cell. Their technology could lead to what s called a live-attenuated vaccine. Such vaccines contain a weakened version of the virus, purposely injected to trigger the production of antibodies and create immunity rather than cause disease. Live attenuation isn t foolproof The classic live-attenuated vaccine is for poliovirus, invented by Jonas Salk in the mid 20th century. But the process isn t foolproof. The simple RNA genome lets viruses make millions of copies within days, and many of those copies contain  mistakes,  or mutations, that can slightly alter the vaccine virus and restore its ability to cause disease. That s one reason why RNA viruses are hard to eradicate and why some people get vaccine-induced sickness. To minimize the chances of a vaccine-induced infection, the researchers changed one specific amino acid in the RNA polymerase (a phenylalanine) to another amino acid (a tryptophan). First, they showed that the tryptophan caused the polymerase to make fewer mutations, and this in turn reduced its ability to replicate and cause disease. Second, even if the virus tries to mutate the change away, then it can no longer replicate, so the virus self-destructs   which is why the researchers call their modification a  genetic poison pill.  The demonstration of this poison pill in the coxsackievirus B3 could theoretically translate to other positive-sense RNA viruses, including those linked to asthma and to foot-and-mouth disease that is a major animal health concern in Europe and South America. And now, to see if it works This past spring, Peersen received a new National Institutes of Health grant to continue testing the genetic modification in live animals, in partnership with researchers at the University of Wisconsin.  We think it s going to work, but we have to show that it will,  Peersen said.  Trying to outsmart Mother Nature is pretty daunting, especially in these viruses. There are ways that things happen you never anticipate, and the virus finds a way to survive. ","Published: July 18, 2016"

This collaboration will develop tools and evaluate assays to help drive drug discovery and biomarker research for select Bayer hemostasis-related programs. The sensitivity of T2MR in blood coagulation (hemostasis) research allows for the rapid and comprehensive monitoring of drug side effects in animal models and patients. ""We are very enthusiastic about our collaboration with Bayer and the important validation it represents for our T2MR technology in the field of hemostasis,"" said John McDonough, chief executive officer of T2 Biosystems. ""Together with Bayer, we look forward to continuing the exploration of the clinical potential of our platform to provide improved patient care in this area of significant unmet need.  The companies have been working together for the last year and recently extended the collaboration to include a number of pre-clinical and early clinical programs. This collaboration will enable T2 Biosystems and Bayer to evaluate the T2MR technology with the hemostasis drug discovery and development efforts at Bayer. About T2MR T2MR is a diagnostic detection method utilizing miniaturized magnetic resonance technology that measures how water molecules react in the presence of magnetic fields. The T2MR technology platform offers a fast, simple and sensitive alternative to existing diagnostic methodologies. T2MR technology powers all of the diagnostic innovation at T2 Biosystems and enables the detection of a variety of different targets including molecular targets, immunodiagnostics and a broad range of hemostasis measurements. Additionally, by incorporating the T2MR diagnostic platform into clinical trials, drug developers have the potential to dramatically enrich patient populations, which could result in decreased timelines and reduced cost of trials. Another key benefit to drug developers is the potential to have patients diagnosed rapidly enough to avoid courses of empiric therapy prior to the administration of the investigational drug, which could help to achieve clinical superiority. About T2MR in Hemostasis  The first stage of wound healing, hemostasis, is a complex interaction of proteins and biochemical signals regulating the balance between bleeding and blood clotting. Patients with impaired hemostasis are either unable to promote the formation of blood clots to stabilize excessive bleeding or are hypercoaguable, with clots forming when they are not medically necessary. For hemostasis measurements, T2MR is highly sensitive to changes in viscosity in a blood sample (such as clot formation, stabilization or dissipation), which alter the magnetic resonance signal and enable identification of clinically relevant hemostasis changes. The T2MR-based hemostasis platform is being developed to provide a wide range of hemostasis diagnostics, including measurements of platelet activity, fibrinolysis and clotting time, directly from a blood volume not more than a finger stick amount of blood sample.

In the lab, using phantom models, the ""smart"" nanoparticle the team has dubbed PEARLs   photo-thermal enhancing auto-regulating liposomes   showed how it can solve the two bottlenecks currently preventing more effective use of photo-thermal therapy with patients.  These are overheating of tissue that can cause collateral damage during treatment, and the inability to ablate larger tumour volumes because the light stops travelling when it is absorbed. Dr. Zheng, a chemist, explains: ""Our smart nanoparticle is super cool. It can absorb light, generate heat and ablate the tumour. It's a thermal sensor and once it reaches the desired ablation temperature of 55C, it becomes invisible allowing the light to move deeper into more areas of tumour and repeat the treatment process. ""The result is a promising new way to heat and ablate larger volumes of tumour with minimal damage to surrounding tissues in a controlled and precise way. The next step is to conduct pre-clinical studies to test the concept further."" For the past 10 years at the Princess Margaret, Dr. Zheng's research has focused on advancing nanoparticle technology by harnessing light, heat and sound to advance tumour imaging and targeted treatment.

The finding opens a new avenue for targeted treatments in the rapidly advancing field of cancer immunotherapy. A class of immune cells known as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) helps to activate the body s defences against a range of threats, from viruses and bacteria to cancer. As their name implies, these cells work by carrying microscopic pieces of pathogens or tumours to lymph nodes, where the fragments are  presented  to other immune cells known as T cells. In this way, APCs prime T cells to specifically attack the invaders.  There has always been a missing link between the tumour and the specific immune cells recruited in the lymph node,  said UCSF s Matthew  Max  Krummel, PhD, professor of pathology, who led the study.  We wondered,  What is the cell that bridges those two arenas to continually activate the immune response?  As reported in the July 14, 2016 online edition of Cancer Cell, a group led by Krummel identified that cell, a specific type of APC known as a CD103 dendritic cell. Additionally, the researchers determined that the CD103 cell must express a protein called CCR7 to properly transport cancer antigens between the tumour and lymph nodes. Humans have their own version of CD103 dendritic cells, which are known as CD141 cells. Krummel, a member of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that the new work was made possible by advances in a technique known as intravital two-photon microscopy, which enabled the researchers to directly observe interactions between APCs and T cells in lymph nodes of live mice with melanoma tumours.  Imaging with a two-photon microscope brings veracity,  Krummel said.  If you see something happening in the lymph node you don t wonder if it was an artefact of mixing two things in a tissue culture dish. If you see it in vivo, you know it s a real biological phenomenon.  After fluorescently labelling melanoma cells in the mouse model, Krummel and colleagues confirmed that CD103 cells transfer tumour antigens from their origin to the lymph nodes. When the group genetically eliminated CCR7 from CD103 cells, this transport was greatly reduced, and tumours in mice lacking CCR7 grew significantly faster. Previous research in the Krummel lab had shown that CD103 dendritic cells keep T cells activated within the tumour microenvironment, but the current study illuminated their expanded role.  It turns out that the same cell type we previously studied within tumours also raises the immune alarm within lymph nodes, providing the rest of the body with information about the tumour,  Krummel said.  And when it comes to CD103 trafficking, CCR7 is like the address on an envelope.  To investigate the potential consequences of varying CCR7 levels in humans, the researchers mined data from clinical samples including those from The Cancer Genome Atlas, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) database containing genomic and clinical information from thousands of cancer patients. In one example, of 44 applicable patients, those with higher than average CCR7 expression had more T cells infiltrate their tumours, showing more efficient immune priming. More importantly, whereas those in the lower 50 percent of CCR7 expression died within three and a half years, 65 percent of the top half remained alive over this period. Current immunotherapy approaches known as checkpoint blockade are focused on ramping up the response of already activated T cells, but the new study opens the possibility of developing  upstream  treatments that aim to get T cells activated in the first place, said Edward Roberts, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Krummel lab and first author of the new Cancer Cell paper.  Understanding which cells are critical for initiating an anti-tumour immune response allows us to start thinking about novel approaches to immune therapy, which could complement the successes achieved in recent years with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.  To advance this goal, Krummel co-founded Precision Immune, a startup company aimed at boosting the immune response to cancer. The company expects to have pharmaceuticals, based on this and previous Krummel-led work on CD103, ready for clinical trials in the next five years.  In the war on cancer, we have to try all avenues,  Krummel said.","Published: July 18, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/structure-of-cold-virus-solved-210464,Structure of Cold Virus Solved Researchers have identified the structure of an elusive cold virus linked to child asthma and respiratory infections  providing the foundation for treating the virus  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The atomic structure of an elusive cold virus linked to severe asthma and respiratory infections in children has been solved by a team of researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Purdue University. The findings are published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and provide the foundation for future antiviral drug and vaccine development against the virus, rhinovirus C.  Rhinovirus C has been the  missing link  in explaining illness caused by the common cold,  says Michael Rossmann, Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Science at Purdue and co-lead of the study with UW Madison s Ann Palmenberg, professor of biochemistry and with the Institute for Molecular Virology.  This is sure to spark major new efforts toward the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, particularly for the prevention of asthma.  In fact, multiple pharmaceutical companies have been waiting for the data, Palmenberg says. Rhinovirus C is resistant to current antiviral drugs and no vaccines exist. It was discovered just 10 years ago and health experts believe it is responsible for 50 to 85 percent of all childhood hospitalizations for asthma. Asthma affects an estimated 24 million people in the U.S. and asthmatic children infected with rhinovirus C have been shown in previous studies to have more severe asthma symptoms. Rhinovirus C infections are also a major contributor to poor outcomes for people with chronic lung conditions like cystic fibrosis, and early exposure to the virus can cause lifelong lung scarring leading to persistent respiratory difficulties later, says Palmenberg. Last fall, using a rhinovirus C preparation grown in the Palmenberg lab   currently one of the few places in the world capable of culturing the virus   and an imaging technology new to Purdue, Rossmann s graduate student, Yue Liu, first author of the study, was able to map the full atomic structure of a rhinovirus C particle. Discerning the structure of microscopic biological agents like viruses allows them to be studied and understood in ways not possible by other means. For instance, Liu uncovered physical features of rhinovirus C that help explain why it is resistant to standard antiviral treatments, how it interacts with cells to cause infection, and why it behaves as a different disease from other members of the enterovirus family.  We found some interesting things,  says Palmenberg.  Unlike normal rhinoviruses, this one has spikes on the surface of the particles. We had not anticipated that.  This and other virus surface changes help explain why clinical rhinovirus drug trials, which rely on different virus surfaces, have generally failed when tested against rhinovirus C isolates over the last four to five years, says Palmenberg. However, the spikes present new binding sites for the human immune response to infection and as such, may present promising new targets for the development of different types of drugs. Or, they may contain structure elements that could be leveraged for effective vaccines.  Another new finding is that 30 percent of the virus particles were empty and do not contain genetic material,  Palmenberg says. The  empty  particles are not capable of causing infection, but like tiny molecular mimics, they present virus-specific information to the immune system.  They could be immune decoys,  says Palmenberg, luring the body to fight off noninfectious viral particles, leaving infectious virus free to do its dirty work.  No other rhinoviruses seem to do this naturally.  They could potentially be used for vaccines. The virus was among the first samples analyzed with a new cryo-electron microscopy system at Purdue, which was designed to operate at vastly higher resolution than previous instruments. The system allows for multiple imaging of single virus particles, rather than relying on a composite of images from thousands of individual viruses. Therefore, the system is faster, more accurate and gives higher resolution structures from less virus material. While the rhinovirus C structure determination was certainly accelerated by this new technology, it was also dependent upon Rossmann s many years of expertise, Liu s efforts, and years of work by Palmenberg s experienced team in order to get the virus to grow under laboratory conditions.  If you can t grow it, you can t do experiments,  says Palmenberg.  That was the linchpin for this structure   it took us two-and-a-half years of work to figure out how to put sufficient virus into a tube so we could give it to Purdue.  That process has now been licensed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, a private nonprofit that manages intellectual property at UW Madison. While learning how to culture rhinovirus C, Palmenberg s research team discovered the virus only infects certain lung cells that express a particular genetic form of a cell-surface molecule called cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3). The team published those results last year in PNAS. When a rhinovirus C particle encounters a cell bearing the right CDHR3 protein, it can lock onto and gain entry into the cell. During the ensuing infection, it makes many copies of its genetic material, using the cell s machinery, and this reassembles into many more virus particles that are then released to infect more cells. When CDHR3 is expressed on cells deep in the lungs, the virus infections can wreak havoc, says Rossmann.  It creates the perfect storm for the severest type of asthma-inducing, lung-scarring events.  But  knowing how to grow it doesn t tell you what it looks like,  says Palmenberg. Multiple types of rhinovirus C exist and they are part of a larger group of illness-causing viruses, including cold viruses, rhinovirus A and B.  We knew it would be different from rhinovirus A and B: It didn t respond to drugs, it used a different receptor, it had different biological properties. So, what was going on?  With the new structure data, the team is much closer to finding answers. In fact, mapping the rhinovirus C particles also showed where on these surfaces the virus likely makes contact with the CDHR3 molecules, presenting yet another opportunity to design drugs which may prevent infection. Palmenberg and Rossmann have collaborated for 34 years, ever since her former mentor, UW Madison professor emeritus Roland Rueckert, and Rossmann collaborated to become the first to determine the structure of rhinovirus B. Once Palmenberg worked out how to grow rhinovirus C, she, too, partnered with Rossmann. Her research technician and co-author of the paper, Marchel Hill, delivered a crude test sample of the virus to Purdue on a Friday morning last fall. Liu performed some of the imaging that same day and a preliminary structure were mostly ready by Saturday. The study was also co-authored by UW Madison s Kelly Watters; Purdue s Thomas Klose, Zhenguo Chen and Wen Jiang; and Yury Bochkov of the UW Madison School of Medicine and Public Health. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health.","Published: July 18, 2016"

Researchers recently reported that the tool, called HotSpot3D, allowed them to model how genetic mutations change the ways proteins function and interact with each other to potentially drive cancer. It also helped them identify more than 800 novel mutations that potentially could be targeted with existing drugs.  The research team that developed HotSpot3D, led by Li Ding, Ph.D., and Feng Chen, Ph.D., of Washington University in St. Louis, published results from this first large-scale testing of the computational tool June 13 in Nature Genetics. 2-D Instructions, 3-D Functions DNA provides cells with a linear set of instructions for producing proteins. But when cells use those instructions to produce proteins, those proteins naturally fold into complicated 3-dimensional structures that dictate how they function. Mutations in DNA that are linearly distant from each other (that is, far apart from each other on the DNA strand) may encode pieces of a protein that sit in close proximity to each other and potentially affect how each functions once that protein has folded into its active structure. Structural changes resulting from mutations can also alter how proteins interact with other proteins or small molecules that control their activity. For example, rendering a protein unable to bind to its normal cellular receptor or molecular regulators could cause faulty signalling in a molecular pathway, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumour development. Tools that analyze some aspects of a genetic mutation's impact on protein structure have been available. But while sequencing glioblastoma samples for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Drs. Ding and Chen realized the urgent need to develop more advanced tools for their research.  We really wanted to understand how mutations interact with each other, and more importantly, we wanted to understand how mutations interact with drugs,  said Dr. Ding. So, in a project almost 10 years in the making, the research team programmed HotSpot3D to map genetic mutation data from TCGA to two large, open resources that catalogue protein structure. HotSpot3D uses these resources to model how genetic mutations might influence three different types of protein interactions: intramolecular (between pieces of a single protein), intermolecular (between two or more proteins), and drug protein (between a protein and a drug designed to suppress or increase the activity of that protein).  In sequencing data, you tend to have a vast amount of [DNA] variants that you discover in cancer samples,"" said Dr. Chen. ""Some of them may have very little functional impact, but some of them may really be the drivers for cancers.  By teasing out which variants may actually change how proteins fold and work, HotSpot3D can help narrow down a subset of candidate mutations for further analyses, he explained. Speeding Up the Sorting Process In the Nature Genetics paper, the researchers applied HotSpot3D to more than 4,400 tumour samples sequenced by TCGA. These samples included about half a million mutations in 19 tumour types. The software identified more than 6,000 intramolecular and intermolecular interactions driven by mutations, some rare, that had potential significance to cancer development. By comparing drug protein interactions, HotSpot3D also identified more than 800 mutations that could potentially be targeted with existing therapies, such as drugs that inhibit a protein called BRAF. Many of the drugs that HotSpot3D predicted could bind to altered protein structures resulting from mutations are not traditional anticancer agents but other medications, including anti-inflammatory agents, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants. In proof-of-concept laboratory experiments, the researchers validated multiple mutations that HotSpot3D predicted would affect a protein called EGFR, a well-established driver of several types of cancer. In cell lines, several mutations were associated with higher-than-normal EGFR activity, even though they are located far from the EGFR gene in DNA. Any results from HotSpot3D would need experimental validation, but the software potentially could help researchers rapidly sort through the large number of mutations found in any particular tumour and find an area of the genome to study further, commented Jacqueline Milne, Ph.D., head of the Electron Microscopy Core in NCI s Center for Cancer Research. This type of mutation drug analysis could potentially be used to develop personalized treatment regimens, including regimens for diseases other than cancer, wrote the authors. They could also guide researchers interested in repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs, added Dr. Milne. Targeted drugs will not exist for many of the mutations identified with HotSpot3D, but if clusters of mutations from different tumours all map to one three-dimensional space in a specific protein, drug developers might be very interested in looking closer at that area, concluded Dr. Milne.","Published: July 18, 2016"

The study found that a group of four proteins, specifically DNA-binding proteins known as transcription factors, work in a multi-tiered fashion to control the T-cell genetic switch in a series of steps. This was a surprise because transcription factors are widely assumed to work in a simultaneous, all-at-once fashion when collaborating to regulate genes. The results may ultimately allow doctors to boost a person's T-cell population. This has potential applications in fighting various diseases, including AIDS, which infects mature T cells. ""In the past, combinatorial gene regulation was thought to involve all the transcription factors being required at the same time,"" says Kueh, who works in the lab of Ellen Rothenberg, Caltech's Albert Billings Ruddock Professor of Biology. ""This was particularly true in the case of the genetic switch for T-cell commitment, where it was thought that a quorum of the factors working simultaneously was needed to ensure that the gene would only be expressed in the right cell type."" The authors report that a key to their finding was the ability to image live cells in real-time. They genetically engineered mouse cells so that a gene called Bcl11b the key switch for T cells would express a fluorescent protein in addition to its own Bcl11b protein. This caused the mouse cells to glow when the Bcl11b gene was turn on. By monitoring how different transcription factors, or proteins, affected the activation of this genetic switch in individual cells, the researchers were able to isolate the distinct roles of the proteins. The results showed that four proteins work together in three distinct steps to flip the switch for T cells. Kueh says to think of the process as a team of people working together to get a light turned on. He says first two proteins in the chain (TCF1 and GATA3) open a door where the main light switch is housed, while the next protein (Notch) essentially switches the light on. A fourth protein (Runx1) controls the amplitude of the signal, like sliding a light dimmer. ""We identify the contributions of four regulators of Bcl11b, which are all needed for its activation but carry out surprisingly different functions in enabling the gene to be turned on,"" says Rothenberg. ""It's interesting the gene still needs the full quorum of transcription factors, but we now find that it also needs them to work in the right order. This makes the gene respond not only to the cell's current state, but also to the cell's recent developmental history."" Team member Kenneth Ng, a visiting student from California Polytechnic State University, says he was surprised by how much detail they could learn about gene regulation using live imaging of cells. ""I had read about this process in textbooks, but here in this study we could pinpoint what the proteins are really doing,"" he says. The next step in the research is to get a closer look at precisely how the T cell genetic switch itself works. Kueh says he wants to ""unscrew the panels"" of the switch and understand what is physically going on in the chromosomal material around the Bcl11b gene.","Published: July 18, 2016"

Yew and her team identified a gene in vinegar flies responsible for the insect s waterproof coating, which provides them protection from microbes and environmental stress. They nicknamed the gene spidey and announced the findings in a recently published study in PLoS Genetics.  When we knocked out spidey in adult flies, the flies exhibited several striking features: their lifespan was shortened by about 50 percent, they lost almost all of their waxy coating and flies frequently got stuck to the sides of the plastic vials and were unable to free themselves,  said Yew, an assistant researcher based in the Pacific Biosciences Research Center of UHM noa s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology.  This last feature was reminiscent of the comic book character Spider-Man, which is why we named the gene spidey.  Spidey is important for regulating levels of a steroid hormone, which maintains wax-producing cells. This hormone was already known to play a crucial role in the development and metamorphosis of fly larvae. The researchers did not expect that steroid hormones would play such a central role in maintaining adult tissues, such as the wax-producing cells.  We did this work in vinegar flies, which is a major model organism,  said Yew, who grew up in Hawai i and is a graduate of Maryknoll School.  From here, perhaps we can bridge to pest species.  Yew and her colleagues now plan to knock out spidey in pest species like Oriental, Mediterranean and melon fruit flies, which are a major threat to agriculture, and possibly mosquitoes, which can carry human diseases, to see if they lose their waterproofing ability like the vinegar flies. She says it would be at least four more years of more research, testing and government approvals before the discovery could be used as a pest control.","Published: July 18, 2016"

In biomedical research, working with tissue samples is indispensable because it permits insights into the biological reality of patients, for example, in addition to those gained from Petri dishes and computer simulations. The tissue is usually fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax in order to keep the tissue, as far as possible, in its original condition for later analyses. It was previously assumed that in material that had been treated in this way an analysis of metabolites, in contrast to DNA or proteins, would be barely possible for technical reasons. A team of scientists from the Analytical Pathology department at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen led by Prof. Axel Karl Walch has now succeeded in refuting this belief. Fixed tissues accessible on a large scale The researchers developed a protocol which makes it possible   within one day   to determine the metabolite composition of tissues using a mass spectrometry imaging approach, and to make it visible in tissue sections. Relatively small amounts of material are required for this, according to the authors.  Our method permits the analysis of minute biopsies and even tissue micro-arrays, making it particularly interesting for molecular research and diagnostics,  explains doctoral candidate Achim Buck, together with Alice Ly, the first author of the study. In order to ensure that the measured data was not falsified by the fixation process, the authors compared it with the measured values for the same samples that were not fixed but were shock frozen.  A large proportion of the measured metabolites occurred in both analyses,  reports Achim Buck.  We were able to show that the method works reliably and avoids the complex logistics and storage of shock-frozen samples.  In addition to simple handling and high reproducibility, the possibility to conduct high throughput work is a key advantage of the new method*, according to the scientists. Above all, however, it is now possible to study the spatial distribution of molecules in the tissue graphically and with great precision.  That is an enormous advantage, both in research and in clinical diagnostic practice,  research team leader Walch says, assessing the new possibilities.  Using our new analytical method, our aim is now to identify new predictive, diagnostic and prognostic markers in tissues, as well as to understand disease processes.  The scientists hope that publication of the protocol will also lead to an exchange with and further developments by colleagues with a view to advancing metabolic analyses of archived tissues.

The findings provide a new mechanistic understanding of OCD and other psychiatric disorders and suggest that they are highly amenable to treatment using a class of drugs that has already been investigated in clinical trials. See Also: OCD patients' brains light up to reveal how compulsive habits develop ""These new findings are enormously hopeful for considering how to approach neurodevelopmental diseases and behavioral and thought disorders,"" said the study's senior investigator Nicole Calakos, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurology and neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Center. OCD, which affects 3.3 million people in the United States, is an anxiety disorder that is characterized by intrusive, obsessive thoughts and repeated compulsive behaviors that collectively interfere with a person's ability to function in daily life. In 2007, Duke researchers (led by Guoping Feng, who is now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) created a new mouse model of OCD by deleting a gene that codes for Sapap3, a protein that helps organize the connections between neurons so that the cells can communicate. Similar to the way some people with OCD wash their hands excessively, the Sapap3-lacking mouse grooms itself excessively and shows signs of anxiety. Although researchers praised the new model for its remarkable similarity to a human psychiatric disorder, and have begun using it to study OCD, questions remain about how the loss of the Sapap3 gene leads to the grooming behaviors. Related: Multitasking hunger neurons also control compulsive behaviors In the new study, Calakos's team found that overactivity of a single type of receptor for neurotransmitters mGluR5, found in a brain region involved in compulsive behaviors was the major driver for the abnormal behaviors. When researchers gave Sapap3-lacking mice a chemical that blocks mGluR5, the grooming and anxiety behaviors abated. ""The reversibility of the symptoms was immediate on a minute time frame,"" Calakos said. In contrast, the original study describing Sapap3-lacking mice found that antidepressants could help treat symptoms but on the time scale of weeks, as is typical with these drugs in patients. The immediate effects seen in the new study were also surprising, given that the brains of these mice appear developmentally immature and neurodevelopmental diseases are not typically thought of as being easily reversible, Calakos said. Intriguingly, by taking normal laboratory mice and giving them a drug that boosted mGluR5 activity, Calakos's team could instantaneously recreate the same excessive grooming and anxiety behaviors they saw in the Sapap3-lacking mice. The researchers found that without a functioning Sapap3 protein, the mGluR5 receptor is always on. That, in turn, makes the brain regions involved in compulsion overactive. In particular, a group of neurons that give the ""green light"" for an action, like face-washing, is working overtime. (These same neurons can promote a habit, such as eating sweets, according to a study published by Calakos's team earlier this year). Calakos said that mGluR5 should be considered for the treatment of compulsive behaviors. ""But which people and which compulsive behaviors? We don't know yet,"" she added. Don't Miss: Study of brain networks shows differences in children with OCD Other lines of research have explored targeting mGluR5 with drugs to move its activity up or down in the brain. For example, mGluR5-blockers are being considered for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. But because mGluR5 inhibitors have not always panned out in clinical trials, it may make sense to target different parts of the mGluR5 pathway or identify specific patient subsets, Calakos said. New non-invasive imaging technologies now make it possible to measure mGluR5 activity in humans. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

See Also: New approach for treating ALS: Re-evaluating old drugs ALS destroys the neurons connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. As those neurons die, patients progressively lose the ability to move, speak, eat, and breathe. The mouse-model study, published in Science Translational Medicine, suggests the most common genetic mutation associated with ALS plays an important role in not only the nervous system, but also the blood and immune systems. ""The point of our paper was to determine the function of this gene and what it normally helps to do in the body,"" said lead author Kevin Eggan, a professor in Harvard's Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB) and an HSCI principal faculty member who has been studying ALS for more than a decade. According to Eggan, one way to better understand the gene is to catalog what is missing or goes awry when it is ""knocked out,"" or inactivated. The scientists found that mice without a functional copy of the gene C9ORF72 had abnormally large spleens, livers, and lymph nodes, and got sick and died. Mice with one working copy experienced similar but less severe changes. ""I realized immediately that the mouse knockout had immune dysfunction,"" said Leonard Zon, a professor in HSCRB, after seeing the preliminary data at an informal presentation. Learn More: Study uncovers key differences among ALS patients The research team predicted that the gene mutation would affect neurons, but the finding that it also inflamed other cells, namely those involved in autoimmunity, was ""unexpected."" With input from Zon and immunologist Luigi Notarangelo of Boston Children's Hospital, the team decided to change direction and further explore the gene's impact on the immune system. First author Aaron Burberry, a postdoctoral fellow in the Eggan lab with a background in immunology, designed an experiment to test whether providing the sick mice with cells capable of making new immune cells via a bone marrow transplant would help. Knockout mice that received a bone marrow transplant lived on average 43 days longer, weighed more, and had a greater number of blood platelets throughout their lifespan. ""The mice seemed to get better,"" said Eggan, though he stressed that the bone marrow transplant did not wholly rescue the animals, suggesting that there may also be functions of C9ORF72 in other organs. Whether or not anti-inflammatory drugs or bone marrow transplants help ALS patients has been studied and debated for years. ""When doctors look for autoimmunity and inflammation in ALS patients there have been confusing and conflicting views,"" Eggan said. ""Some people find it, others don't."" Related: Study shows more patients with ALS have genetic origin than previously thought Historically, clinical studies have tested the general ALS population, likely without accounting for the variety of gene mutations that gave rise to individual cases. More than 100 distinct mutations in any one of 20 genes can contribute to ALS.

Insel, PhD, former Director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""This new atlas will be the foundation for the next generation of studies linking the genetics of neurodevelopmental disorders to the development of specific brain pathways."" The goal of the NHP atlas was to marry the techniques of modern transcriptomics with the rich history of anatomical developmental studies by measuring gene activity at a series of ten important stages in prenatal and postnatal brain development. At each stage a technique called laser microdissection was used to precisely isolate fine layers and nuclei of cortical and subcortical brain regions associated with human psychiatric disease, thereby creating a high resolution time series of the generation and maturation of these brain regions and their underlying cell types. The gene expression data are complemented by neuroimaging and histological and cellular resolution gene expression reference data. Learn More: Cracking the code of brain development ""This time series reveals how genes code for the enormous complexity of the human brain,"" says Trygve Bakken, MD, PhD, Scientist II at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. ""Prenatal development is a time of exceptionally rapid change reflected in gene usage, yet many of the molecular characteristics of the mature brain are not achieved until surprisingly late in postnatal development when brain development can be affected by physical activity and social interaction."" Because the atlas targeted areas of the brain associated with human disease, the authors collaborated with colleagues at the Baylor College of Medicine to use this molecular map to pinpoint when and where candidate genes for diseases like autism and schizophrenia become active. Genes associated with autism are particularly active in the prenatal neocortex in newly generated neurons, consistent with other studies and the early onset of autistic pathology. In contrast, genes for schizophrenia become active much later in development, also in neurons in the neocortex, which correlates with the disease's later onset.

At three months, the athletes maintained their reduction of symptoms, and they had all returned to full physical exercise. The study findings were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Sports Concussion Conference that was held July 8-10, 2016 in Chicago. See Also: Novel peptide protects cognitive function after mild traumatic brain injuryConcussion from sports or recreation often leads to headache, sleep disturbance, nausea, cognitive difficulties, depression, or other symptoms. While the majority of concussed athletes recover within a few days, roughly ten percent of them go on to have symptoms that last for weeks, months, or longer. The study included nineteen participants, who had concussion symptoms for an average of five and one half months, before using HIRREM. HIRREM is an acronym for High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring. It is a noninvasive computer-based methodology developed by Lee Gerdes, CEO of Brain State Technologies and former Silicon Valley software engineer. The technology applies software algorithms to translate brain frequencies into sound frequencies (audible tones) that are returned to the user in real-time, for the intended use of supporting the brain to self-optimize its electrical activity patterns. A majority of the athletes in the study went back to participation in their competitive sport. There were also durable changes in variability of their heart rates, suggesting enhanced capacity for the heart to make rapid, adaptive adjustments in its pumping function. In a portion of the group that also underwent reaction testing before and after the HIRREM sessions, there were significant improvements on average. Reaction time is typically slowed after concussion. Don't Miss: Women show persistent memory impairment after concussionDr. Sung Lee, Director of Research at Brain State Technologies and a co-investigator on the study, stated that ""Concussion presents challenges not only to the brain but also the body, since the brain is the organ of central command. We were excited for these athletes that their improvements were not only in self-reported symptoms, but also the objective measures of heart rate variability, reaction time, and return to play."" In the United States, it has been estimated that up to 190,000 individuals develop persisting symptoms each year, from a concussion that happened during sports or recreation. Professional guidelines state that return to competition should not depend on use of medications that may mask symptoms that would otherwise prevent an athlete's return to play. Not only can persisting symptoms after concussion put individuals at risk for an end to their athletic careers, they may be severe enough to prevent participation in non-athletic activities.

These same genes typically are turned off when the activity ceases - but when that doesn't happen, damaging consequences can occur. A study in mice at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) in St. Louis shows how such genes stuck in the ""on"" position can lead to faulty brain wiring that affects learning and memory. Don't Miss: The way to learn ""We've shown in mice that genes don't just shut off by themselves; there's an active mechanism to turn off genes after they're turned on,"" said Azad Bonni, MD, PhD, the Edison Professor of Neuroscience and head of the Department of Neuroscience. ""If that mechanism is disrupted in the brain, you see serious consequences for learning and memory."" Genes in living cells constantly are being turned on and off in response to signals as diverse as physical activity, hormones and microbial infection. Decades of research have gone into understanding how and why genes turn on, but how genes turn off has consistently received less attention. Bonni, Yue Yang, PhD, Tomoko Yamada, PhD, and colleagues decided to investigate how genes turn off in the brain. In doing so, they found that the inability to turn off such genes leads to faulty brain wiring. The researchers studied genes in the cerebellum of mice the part of the brain responsible for motor functions such as walking that turn on when the mice are physically active. They found that a large enzyme is bound to the genes that are turned on when the mice move about, but not to the genes that had not been switched on by movement. The enzyme, known as the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, appears to be critical to turning off genes. Mice that lack the enzyme are unable to turn off the genes after physical activity ceased. The enzyme, the scientists found, turns off genes by switching out one kind of a DNA-associated protein for another. These proteins, called histones, serve as spools around which the DNA thread is wound, in some places tightly and other places loosely. By switching out one kind of histone for another, the enzyme causes the DNA to be more tightly wound, shutting off any genes in that section of DNA. ""Turning on and off genes is a fundamental property of cell biology, and this is the first epigenetic mechanism that explains how you turn off genes after they're turned on,"" Bonni said. ""I think we'll find that this mechanism turns off genes in many different contexts."" Epigenetics refers to factors apart from the DNA sequence itself that affect whether genes are on or off. See Also: Changes in a single gene s action can control addiction- and depression-related behaviors ""We think that the NuRD complex has the potential to rapidly turn off thousands of genes,"" said Yamada, co-lead author on the study and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. During development, neurons form many connections with each other and then prune back all but the most important ones. Neurons in the cerebellum of mice lacking the enzyme do not prune, leaving abnormal connections in place. ""We were surprised to discover that failure to prune connections caused abnormal responses of the neurons to the environment,"" said Yang, a postdoctoral researcher and co-lead author on the study. ""Our study reveals the importance of eliminating the excess connections formed in early development."" Such connections did not affect the mice's ability to walk but did affect their ability to learn motor skills as adults. In people, learning a motor skill would include learning how to play the piano or ride a bicycle. Adult mice lacking the enzyme were unable to learn how to walk on a rotating rod that gradually sped up, a task other mice could do easily. ""They're walking normally, they're coordinated, but they are really profoundly impaired in learning,"" Bonni said. ""What's really surprising is that these deficits are due not to failure to activate genes but to failure to turn them off."" Learn More: Schizophrenia-associated genetic variants affect gene regulation in the developing brainBonni and colleagues are working on figuring out the mechanism by which changes in gene activity lead to changes in brain cell activity. ""This enzyme is related to other enzymes that are mutated in neurodevelopmental diseases,"" Bonni said. ""The ability to turn off genes turns out to have profound consequences for brain wiring and learning, and we want to figure out how."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Detection of cell-free circulating tumour DNA is a promising method (sometimes called 'liquid biopsy') with the potential to diagnose, profile, and monitor cancer, and there is an acute need for standards to compare the detection limits of diagnostic assay development. SeraCare's ctDNA reference materials are mixtures of size-appropriate fragments of DNA containing highly multiplexed numbers of somatic 'driver' mutations, produced at very specific allele frequencies in a defined, fragmented genomic DNA background from a single-individual; then stabilized and blended into a synthetic plasma-like matrix under proprietary technology developed at SeraCare. This material can be treated just like a patient sample run through the full extraction and analysis process, and can be used to determine analytical performance of a ctDNA molecular assay down to as low as 0.1% allele frequency (a single mutant molecule in 1,000 normal ones). Under the terms of the agreement, SeraCare will provide their Seraseq  ctDNA Reference Material technology to NIST for development of digital PCR measurement methodologies, and NIST will facilitate a wider distribution of these materials to anonymized laboratories for inter-laboratory comparisons. The joint efforts are meant to hasten the development of calibrated reference standards for circulating tumour DNA   critical for expanding the use of these technologies into the translational research and diagnostic labs. ""SeraCare and NIST make a natural fit, given NIST's measurement expertise and commitment to bridge the worlds of translational research and clinical diagnostics,"" said Dr. Russell Garlick, CSO of SeraCare Life Sciences. ""NIST can facilitate the rapid adoption of calibrated and highly functional molecular standards in the rapidly evolving field of circulating tumour DNA assay development."" ""The interlaboratory comparisons made possible by this partnership will speed NIST's efforts to overcome measurement challenges and advance cancer-detection technology broadly for the biomedical community,"" said Kenneth Cole, a group leader in NIST's Biosystems and Biomaterials Division.

This is a community effort, inviting all scientists and enthusiasts to participate in a collaborative crowd-sourced benchmarking effort. Based on the success of other recent challenges, the new Somatic Mutation Calling RNA challenge will use a cloud model in which contestants submit their algorithms, not their results, to the evaluation. It will be the first challenge to make use of the new NCI Cloud Pilots, which will provide access to co-located data and shared tools as well as some free compute credits that can be used by participants and for final scoring. The challenge was launched on Thursday, June 30, 2016. Registration is available at the Sage Bionetworks Synapse website. Genomic rearrangements in cancer cells produce fusion transcripts which may give rise to chimeric protein products not present in normal cells. In addition, cancer cells can express alternate forms of encoded messages that give rise to protein variants different from normal tissue. These chimeras and protein variants can serve as robust diagnostic markers or drug targets. Moreover, ongoing research efforts are beginning to unveil the potential clinical relevance of these variant RNA products. Increasing the  alterome  of tumors by fully characterizing their RNA landscapes will expand our understanding of cancer mechanisms, provide new biomarkers, and reveal possible new RNA-based therapeutics, thus improving personalized patient treatment.  Predicting RNA species in a cancer cell is a particularly challenging task,  said Josh Stuart, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of the challenge leaders.  RNA expression reflects much of the deranged complexity of the underlying cancer cell DNA and then adds another level of derangement on top of that.  RNA sequencing The goal of the SMC-RNA Challenge is to identify the best methods for detecting rearrangements in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Sub-challenges are focused on detecting and quantifying mRNA fusions and isoforms. Methods will be evaluated with both in silico and spiked-in data. Two key questions will be addressed: What is the best way to estimate the abundances of a set of known RNA isoforms, and what is the best way to predict the presence of novel gene fusions? Both of these questions will involve in silico generated and wet lab spiked-in RNA sequencing data. Like the SMC-Het challenge, contestants will contribute their code as self-contained virtual machines that can be run by the challenge administrators. The contestant code will then be executed on one of the three NCI Cloud Pilots that have been established to facilitate analysis of large scale cancer genomics datasets. The Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots are designed to explore innovative methods for accessing and computing on large genomic data. They aim to bring data and analysis together on a single platform by creating a set of data repositories with co-located computational capacity and an application programming interface (API) that provides secure data access. The goals of the cloud pilots are to democratize access to NCI-generated genomic and related data and to create a cost-effective way to provide computational support to the cancer research community. Three contracts were awarded to develop the cloud pilots, to the Broad Institute, the Institute for Systems Biology, and Seven Bridges Genomics. Each of these groups is developing infrastructure and a set of tools to access, explore, and analyze molecular data.  The NCI is intrigued by the potential of the DREAM challenge. Leveraging the cloud pilot concept to enable crowdsourcing to improve cancer transcript detection and quantification shows the kind of significant impact the cloud-based infrastructure can have,  said Tanja Davidsen, a biomedical informatics program manager at the National Cancer Institute. Cloud compute The challenge will initially leverage cloud compute available from the Institute for Systems Biology and then expand to include those provided by Seven Bridges and the Broad Institute. SMC-RNA is based on the containerized software and portable workflow descriptions. As such, upon completion, any compatible cloud system also will be able to replicate the execution and evaluation of all submitted code. To motivate a high level of collaboration, Sage Bionetworks  Synapse platform provides leaderboards, the ability for teams to dynamically form and re-form as the Challenge proceeds, and a discussion forum where participants can share ideas. As an added incentive, all individuals and teams that submit a final model will be invited as consortium coauthors on an overview paper of the challenge that will be submitted to Nature Biotechnology as the official journal partner of the challenge. Top performers will receive travel awards and speaking invitations to the 2017 DREAM Conference.  It is an exciting development to see several technologies converge on this challenge so elegantly,  said Kyle Ellrott , researcher with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, assistant professor at the OHSU School of Medicine, and one of the challenge leaders.  The cloud pilots are available to provide access to scalable compute to large datasets. With the SMC-Het, and now SMC-RNA, we employ an evaluation mechanism that produces reproducible bioinformatics methods. The results of these challenges can be used to solve important problems in cancer genomics. And at the end of the challenge any of the submitted techniques could be made available to the users the cloud pilots for them to apply to their own data. It is truly a dynamic combination that is set to accomplish great things. ","Published: July 15, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/rna-suppresses-inflammation-207914,RNA Suppresses Inflammation Researchers identify a long noncoding RNA that regulates innate immunity  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A long noncoding RNA   called lincRNA-EPS   responsible for regulating innate immunity has been identified by a team of scientists at UMass Medical School. The findings were published in Cell. Katherine A. Fitzgerald, PhD, professor of medicine, is senior author on the study. Abundantly found in macrophages, lincRNA-EPS keeps the genes that trigger inflammation turned off until a pathogen is encountered. This discovery points to an unrecognized role for lincRNAs in the immune system and may lead to new insights into inflammatory diseases caused by uncontrolled immune responses such as lupus or inflammatory bowel disease.  These findings suggest that there is an unexplored layer of regulation controlling inflammatory and immune responses,  said Dr. Fitzgerald.  We ve demonstrated an important functional role of a lincRNA in the immune system.  Long noncoding RNAs are nonprotein coding transcripts arbitrarily defined as longer than 200 nucleotides (to help distinguish them from microRNA, short interfering RNAs, Piwi-interacting RNAs and other short RNAs). It is believed that lincRNA may account for the majority of RNA transcription in the human genome.  Despite their abundance, little is known about the functions these long RNAs play in the immune system,  said Fitzgerald.  In trying to understand the complex genetic circuitry that controls the immune system, immunologists have historically focused on the 2 percent of the genome that code for proteins.  Using a mouse model lacking lincRNA-EPS, Fitzgerald and colleagues showed that in their normal state, macrophages (a type of white blood cell that defends against infections) produce lincRNA-EPS to prevent the spontaneous activation of immune response genes. However, when macrophages detect a potential pathogen, lincRNA-EPS expression is suppressed to release this brake, and the pro-inflammatory response is initiated. Mice that were lacking lincRNA-EPS exhibited increased levels of cytokines and inflammatory responses that led to toxic shock. Researchers found that lincRNA-EPS keeps the expression of immune genes in check by controlling the position of the nucleosome so they are inaccessible. When lincRNA-EPS is no longer expressed in the cells, the structure of the genome changes so critical immune-related genes are exposed for transcription. When researchers reintroduced lincRNA-EPS into the cell, expression of immune genes returned to normal levels.  We have also found that the expression of lincRNA-EPS itself is very carefully regulated and is very sensitive to slight changes,  said Maninjay K. Atianand, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at UMMS and first author of the study.  This lincRNA is an important component in the molecular circuitry to prevent spontaneous activation of key immune genes. These findings have important implications for the potential role that lincRNAs may play in chronic inflammation and immune pathologies.  The next step for Fitzgerald and colleagues is to determine what role lincRNA-EPS plays in intestinal inflammation and its function in the colon, where it is abundantly found.","Published: July 15, 2016"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hiv-hides-no-longer-196953,HIV Hides No Longer Researchers are working to create proteins that clear HIV infected cells in order to eliminate latent infection and dormancy  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.While HIV is no longer the death sentence it once was, we are yet to defeat it entirely. However, a new study from Oxford University offers hope that HIV will eventually have nowhere to hide. Tom Calver spoke to Professor Lucy Dorrell about her work on clearing HIV from the body. Completely curing HIV is difficult. The virus is able to hide in various places around the body, known as HIV reservoirs.  Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) stops viral replication but is not able to eliminate cells that harbour dormant HIV.  So people can be treated successfully and become apparently free from the disease, but HIV bounces back if treatment is stopped and is able to keep re-seeding the reservoirs. The final stage in defeating HIV is therefore to locate and destroy the lurking virus. If we can do that successfully, we may be able to cure HIV infections entirely. Professor Lucy Dorrell and her team look at how we can do that. She explained: 'We are working with a leading UK biotechnology company based in Oxfordshire - Immunocore Ltd - to investigate the potency of novel engineered immune-mobilising T cell receptors-based drugs (ImmTAVs)   these are two-headed proteins that are designed to clear HIV-infected cells.' In a recent paper published in the journal Molecular Therapy, Professor Dorrell and her team reported their findings on ImmTAVs. HIV targets CD4+ T-cells, part of the immune system. If untreated, it is active HIV's destruction of these cells that leads to AIDS. But the virus can also enter some of the cells and remain dormant, so-called latent infection. If the dormant HIV is reactivated, the process of active infection begins again. ImmTAVs are two-headed proteins. One end consists of a genetically engineered T cell receptor that is fine-tuned to detect HIV proteins in an infected cell, even when they are present at very low levels. The other end is an antibody that binds to CD3, which is present on the CD8+ T-cells that kill virus-infected cells. The ImmTAV can therefore recruit a large number of CD8+ T cells and re-direct them to purge the HIV-infected cells. Professor Dorrell said: 'We used cells from HIV patients who had had successful ART. When we added ImmTAV we saw that their CD8+ T-cells killed the latently infected CD4+ T-cells more efficiently than the patients  natural immune response.  Furthermore, if we took CD8+ T-cells from healthy donors and added these alongside the ImmTAV, we saw an even stronger response (up to 85% of the infected cells were removed). This may be because, despite long-term ART, there is some degree of generalised malfunction in CD8+ T cells that has not been fully repaired.  A test using only the donated CD8+ cells had no effect, confirming the essential role of the ImmTAV.' Currently, researchers working on eradication of HIV are developing 'kick and kill' methods, where dormant HIV is reactivated and then a drug or vaccine is added in to eliminate the cells containing reactivated HIV. Having confirmed that ImmTAVs could be effective, the team combined them with the kick and kill approach in the lab. Professor Dorrell said: 'We used latency-reversing agents, which wake up the HIV. Once we confirmed that the HIV was active again, we added ImmTAV. In four out of five cases, the process of reinfection was stopped completely.' So are we close to a complete cure for HIV? Professor Dorrell concluded: 'There is still work to do. This research was carried out in the lab but an effective cure has to take place in the patient. We need to prove that the effects we have seen can be replicated in people. 'ImmTAVs are likely to be one part of an HIV eradication strategy, rather than a complete cure. That strategy could comprise existing anti-retrovirals, ImmTAV and agents that address the weaknesses in HIV patients  CD8+ T-cells. However, these positive results are cause for optimism.'","Published: July 15, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/world-first-alzheimers-vaccine-breakthrough-214101,World First Alzheimer s Vaccine Breakthrough Researchers have made a breakthrough discovery towards an effective vaccine for Alzheimer s by targeting associated proteins  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.With more than 7.5 million new cases of Alzheimer s disease a year, the race to find a vaccine and effective treatment for dementia is growing by the day. Researchers in the US and Australia have make a breakthrough discovery in the international quest to discover a new and potentially effective vaccine targeting the pathological proteins associated with Alzheimer s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In research findings just released in Nature s Scientific Reports journal, Flinders University experts as part of a high-level US research team at the Institute of Molecular Medicine (IMM) and University of California, Irvine (UCI) have made a successful vaccine formulation that targets the abnormal beta-amyloid and tau proteins that signal Alzheimer s disease. With more than 48 million dementia cases in 2015, Alzheimer s is emerging as one of the biggest cost to the world s health-care systems, especially in mature economies in western countries. The World Health Organisation has projected the total global societal cost of dementia-related illnesses and care at more than $US600 billion a year. Without a breakthrough treatment, the number of people living with dementia in Australia is expected to be almost 900,000 by 2050.  If we are successful in pre-clinical trials, in three to five years we could be well on the way to one of the most important developments in recent medical history,  says Flinders University School of Medicine Professor Nikolai Petrovsky, who also is director of South Australian vaccine research company Vaxine Pty Ltd.  Along with our rapidly ageing populations, we now know that the explosion in type 2 diabetes in the West is likely to further dramatically fuel the projected rise in the number of cases of dementia globally, with diabetes being the major risk factor for Alzheimer s disease,  Professor Petrovsky says. The quest to develop treatments or a much anticipated cure for Alzheimer s disease is costly and lengthy. In the 10 years to 2012, 244 compounds were investigated in 413 clinical trials around the world, with only one new drug being approved for temporarily alleviating symptoms of the disease. That s a success rate of 0.4%. The scale of the dementia problem has seen the US Congress commit a further $US350 million to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for research into Alzheimer s disease, taking research funding in the US to more than $US1.3 billion this year. With NIH and Alzheimer s Association funding, the US researchers say they have developed an  exceptional  universal vaccine platform, called MultiTEP, to target the hallmark proteins, aberrant forms of AB and tau proteins.  -amyloid (AB) is a protein found to be prominent in driving Alzheimer s disease, but the accumulation of pathological tau also correlates with the formation of dementia in Alzheimer s patients. Using a combination of anti-amyloid-beta and anti-tau vaccines with powerful and safe adjuvant technology called Advax  developed by Vaxine Pty Ltd  shows promise for both preventive and therapeutic approaches in AD,  Professor David Cribbs from the UCI Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders (UCI MIND) told Bloomberg news agency in the US. Professor Michael Agadjanyan, head of IMM Department of Molecular Immunology, says the MultiTEP platform-based vaccines  do not induce potentially harmful auto-reactive cellular immune responses, while still generating antibodies that bind strongly to the amyloid and tau pathological molecules in brain tissue from AD patients . Co-author of the latest paper, IMM Department of Molecular Immunology, Associate Professor Anahit Ghochikyan, says:  This study suggests that we can immunise patients at the early stages of AD, or even healthy people at risk for AD, using our anti-amyloid-beta vaccine, and, if the disease progresses, then vaccinate with another anti-tau vaccine to increase effectiveness.  She says the cooperative studies with National Institute of Aging IMM scientists and collaborators from UCI and the University of Southern California are working with experts from four companies to conduct non-clinical safety-toxicology studies to fulfil US Government safety standards for the Investigational New Drug application. After completion of these pre-clinical studies, they plan to test the immunogenicity and efficacy of the new vaccines in human trials. Cutting-edge research company Vaxine Pty Ltd is internationally renowned for developing the world s first swine flu vaccine during the 2009 pandemic and is active on other fronts including Ebola and Zika virus research. Vaxine is funded by the US NIH to develop novel compounds called adjuvants that play a critical role in maximising vaccine effectiveness. The Vaxine Advax  adjuvant technology is a key component in the development of IMM s Alzheimer s vaccine.","Published: July 15, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/immune-system-controls-social-interactions-197900,Immune System Controls Social Interactions Research has determined that the immune system affects and dictates social behaviour and interaction   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.In a startling discovery that raises fundamental questions about human behavior, researchers at the School of Medicine have determined that the immune system directly affects   and even controls   creatures  social behavior, such as their desire to interact with others. So could immune system problems contribute to an inability to have normal social interactions? The answer appears to be yes, and that finding could have great implications for neurological conditions such as autism-spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.  The brain and the adaptive immune system were thought to be isolated from each other, and any immune activity in the brain was perceived as sign of a pathology. And now, not only are we showing that they are closely interacting, but some of our behavior traits might have evolved because of our immune response to pathogens,  explained Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, chairman of UVA s Department of Neuroscience.  It s crazy, but maybe we are just multicellular battlefields for two ancient forces: pathogens and the immune system. Part of our personality may actually be dictated by the immune system.  Evolutionary forces at work It was only last year that Kipnis, the director of UVA s Center for Brain Immunology and Glia, and his team discovered that meningeal vessels directly link the brain with the lymphatic system. That overturned decades of textbook teaching that the brain was  immune privileged,  lacking a direct connection to the immune system. The discovery opened the door for entirely new ways of thinking about how the brain and the immune system interact. The follow-up finding is equally illuminating, shedding light on both the workings of the brain and on evolution itself. The relationship between people and pathogens, the researchers suggest, could have directly affected the development of our social behavior, allowing us to engage in the social interactions necessary for the survival of the species while developing ways for our immune systems to protect us from the diseases that accompany those interactions. Social behavior is, of course, in the interest of pathogens, as it allows them to spread. The UVA researchers have shown that a specific immune molecule, interferon gamma, seems to be critical for social behavior and that a variety of creatures, such as flies, zebrafish, mice and rats, activate interferon gamma responses when they are social. Normally, this molecule is produced by the immune system in response to bacteria, viruses or parasites. Blocking the molecule in mice using genetic modification made regions of the brain hyperactive, causing the mice to become less social. Restoring the molecule restored the brain connectivity and behavior to normal. In a paper outlining their findings, the researchers note the immune molecule plays a  profound role in maintaining proper social function.   It s extremely critical for an organism to be social for the survival of the species. It s important for foraging, sexual reproduction, gathering, hunting,  said Anthony J. Filiano, PhD, Hartwell postdoctoral fellow in the Kipnis lab and lead author of the study.  So the hypothesis is that when organisms come together, you have a higher propensity to spread infection. So you need to be social, but [in doing so] you have a higher chance of spreading pathogens. The idea is that interferon gamma, in evolution, has been used as a more efficient way to both boost social behavior while boosting an anti-pathogen response. Understanding the implications The researchers note that a malfunctioning immune system may be responsible for  social deficits in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders.  But exactly what this might mean for autism and other specific conditions requires further investigation. It is unlikely that any one molecule will be responsible for disease or the key to a cure, the researchers believe; instead, the causes are likely to be much more complex. But the discovery that the immune system   and possibly germs, by extension   can control our interactions raises many exciting avenues for scientists to explore, both in terms of battling neurological disorders and understanding human behavior.  Immune molecules are actually defining how the brain is functioning. So, what is the overall impact of the immune system on our brain development and function?  Kipnis said.  I think the philosophical aspects of this work are very interesting, but it also has potentially very important clinical implications.  Findings published Kipnis and his team worked closely with UVA s Department of Pharmacology and the group of Vladimir Litvak, PhD, at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Litvak s team developed a computational approach to investigate the complex dialogue between immune signaling and brain function in health and disease.  Using this approach we predicted a role for interferon gamma, an important cytokine secreted by T lymphocytes, in promoting social brain functions,  Litvak said.  Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of social dysfunction in neurological disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, and may open new avenues for therapeutic approaches.

In a new study, researchers apply big-data analysis to reveal the full extent of viruses  impact on the evolution of humans and other mammals. Their findings suggest an astonishing 30 percent of all protein adaptations since humans  divergence with chimpanzees have been driven by viruses.    When you have a pandemic or an epidemic at some point in evolution, the population that is targeted by the virus either adapt s, or goes extinct. We knew that, but what really surprised us is the strength and clarity of the pattern we found,  said David Enard, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University and the study s first author.  This is the first time that viruses have been shown to have such a strong impact on adaptation.    The study was recently published in the journal eLIFE and will be presented at The Allied Genetics Conference, a meeting hosted by the Genetics Society of America, on July 14.  Proteins perform a vast array of functions that keep our cells ticking. By revealing how small tweaks in protein shape and composition have helped humans and other mammals respond to viruses, the study could help researchers find new therapeutic leads against today s viral threats.    We re learning which parts of the cell have been used to fight viruses in the past, presumably without detrimental effects on the organism,  said the study s senior author, Dmitri Petrov, Ph.D., Michelle and Kevin Douglas Professor of Biology and Associate Chair of the Biology Department at Stanford.  That should give us an insight on the pressure points and help us find proteins to investigate for new therapies.    Previous research on the interactions between viruses and proteins has focused almost exclusively on individual proteins that are directly involved in the immune response   the most logical place you would expect to find adaptations driven by viruses. This is the first study to take a global look at all types of proteins.    The big advancement here is that it s not only very specialized immune proteins that adapt against viruses,  said Enard.  Pretty much any type of protein that comes into contact with viruses can participate in the adaptation against viruses. It turns out that there is at least as much adaptation outside of the immune response as within it.  The team s first step was to identify all the proteins that are known to physically interact with viruses.  After painstakingly reviewing tens of thousands of scientific abstracts, Enard culled the list to about 1,300 proteins of interest.  His next step was to build big-data algorithms to scour genomic databases and compare the evolution of virus -interacting proteins to that of other proteins.   The results revealed that adaptations have occurred three times as frequently in virus -interacting proteins compared with other proteins.    We re all interested in how it is that we and other organisms have evolved, and in the pressures that made us what we are,  said Petrov.  The discovery that this constant battle with viruses has shaped us in every aspect   not just the few proteins that fight infections, but everything   is profound. All organisms have been living with viruses for billions of years; this work shows that those interactions have affected every part of the cell.    Viruses hijack nearly every function of a host organism s cells in order to replicate and spread, so it makes sense that they would drive the evolution of the cellular machinery to a greater extent than other evolutionary pressures such as predation or environmental conditions. The study sheds light on some longstanding biological mysteries, such as why closely-related species have evolved different machinery to perform identical cellular functions, like DNA replication or the production of membranes.  Researchers previously did not know what evolutionary force could have caused such changes.  This paper is the first with data that is large enough and clean enough to explain a lot of these puzzles in one fell swoop,  said Petrov. The team is now using the findings to dig deeper into past viral epidemics, hoping for insights to help fight disease today. For example, HIV -like viruses have swept through the populations of our ancestors as well as other animal species at multiple points throughout evolutionary history. Looking at the effects of such viruses on specific populations could yield a new understanding of our constant war with viruses   and how we might win the next big battle.","Published: July 15, 2016"

A class of immune cells known as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) helps to activate the body s defenses against a range of threats, from viruses and bacteria to cancer. As their name implies, these cells work by carrying microscopic pieces of pathogens or tumors to lymph nodes, where the fragments are  presented  to other immune cells known as T cells. In this way, APCs prime T cells to specifically attack the invaders.  There has always been a missing link between the tumor and the specific immune cells recruited in the lymph node,  said UCSF s Matthew  Max  Krummel, PhD, professor of pathology, who led the study.  We wondered,  What is the cell that bridges those two arenas to continually activate the immune response?  As reported in the July 14, 2016 online edition of Cancer Cell. a group led by Krummel identified that cell, a specific type of APC known as a CD103 dendritic cell. Additionally, the researchers determined that the CD103 cell must express a protein called CCR7 to properly transport cancer antigens between the tumor and lymph nodes. Humans have their own version of CD103 dendritic cells, which are known as CD141 cells. Krummel said that the new work was made possible by advances in a technique known as intravital two-photon microscopy, which enabled the researchers to directly observe interactions between APCs and T cells in lymph nodes of live mice with melanoma tumors.  Imaging with a two-photon microscope brings veracity,  Krummel said.  If you see something happening in the lymph node you don t wonder if it was an artifact of mixing two things in a tissue culture dish. If you see it in vivo, you know it s a real biological phenomenon.  After fluorescently labeling melanoma cells in the mouse model, Krummel and colleagues confirmed that CD103 cells transfer tumor antigens from their origin to the lymph nodes. When the group genetically eliminated CCR7 from CD103 cells, this transport was greatly reduced, and tumors in mice lacking CCR7 grew significantly faster. Previous research in the Krummel lab had shown that CD103 dendritic cells keep T cells activated within the tumor microenvironment, but the current study illuminated their expanded role.  It turns out that the same cell type we previously studied within tumors also raises the immune alarm within lymph nodes, providing the rest of the body with information about the tumor,  Krummel said.  And when it comes to CD103 trafficking, CCR7 is like the address on an envelope.  To investigate the potential consequences of varying CCR7 levels in humans, the researchers mined data from clinical samples including those from The Cancer Genome Atlas, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) database containing genomic and clinical information from thousands of cancer patients. In one example, of 44 applicable patients, those with higher than average CCR7 expression had more T cells infiltrate their tumors, showing more efficient immune priming. More importantly, whereas those in the lower 50 percent of CCR7 expression died within three and a half years, 65 percent of the top half remained alive over this period. Current immunotherapy approaches known as checkpoint blockade are focused on ramping up the response of already activated T cells, but the new study opens the possibility of developing  upstream  treatments that aim to get T cells activated in the first place, said Edward Roberts, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Krummel lab and first author of the new Cancer Cell paper.  Understanding which cells are critical for initiating an anti-tumor immune response allows us to start thinking about novel approaches to immune therapy, which could complement the successes achieved in recent years with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.  To advance this goal, Krummel co-founded Precision Immune, a startup company aimed at boosting the immune response to cancer. The company expects to have pharmaceuticals, based on this and previous Krummel-led work on CD103, ready for clinical trials in the next five years.  In the war on cancer, we have to try all avenues,  Krummel said. In addition to Krummel and Roberts, UCSF co-authors included Miranda Broz, Mikhail Binnewies, Amanda Nelson, Mark Headley, PhD, and Denise Wolf, PhD. They were joined by Tsuneyasu Kaiso, MD, PhD, of Wakayama Medical University Institute of Advanced Medicine; and Dusan Bogunovic, PhD, and Nina Bhardwaj, PhD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

The collaboration brings together the expertise of Dr Alessio Ciulli, one of the pioneers in the field of PROTACs and based in the School of Life Sciences at Dundee, with Boehringer Ingelheim s expertise in drug discovery and clinical development of new therapeutic agents. PROTACs are designed to harness the cell s natural disposal system (the ubiquitin-proteasome) to specifically remove disease causing proteins. They do this by triggering the labelling of these as  expired  proteins, which the proteasome then removes. PROTACs are anticipated to be broadly applicable to therapeutic areas as diverse as oncology, immunology and respiratory diseases. It opens up opportunities to target disease mechanisms that have been difficult to reach with existing modalities. To trigger the degradation of target proteins, PROTACs are made of a moiety that binds the target and a moiety that binds a ubiquitin ligase enzyme, and as a result they are likely to exceed the size of conventional oral drug molecules. The design of such  medium sized  drug molecules represents a considerable challenge.   We are looking forward to working with Dr. Alessio Ciulli, one of the world leaders in this exciting new research area,  said Clive R. Wood, Ph.D., Senior Corporate Vice President, Discovery Research at Boehringer Ingelheim.  Working closely with the researchers at the University of Dundee, one of the top research centers in the UK for life sciences, we aim to establish a unique platform that can generate PROTAC-based drug candidates for multiple areas of unmet medical need.""  We believe our approach has the potential to fundamentally transform how we tackle protein targets to fight disease , said Alessio Ciulli, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Chemical and Structural Biology at the University of Dundee, and winner of the 2015 EFMC Prize for a young medicinal chemist in academia.  We are very excited to partner with Boehringer Ingelheim, one of the world's 20 leading pharmaceutical companies. This is a prime example of an industry-academia collaboration to establish a disruptive new approach to drug discovery, initially developed in academia, and to enable its translation all the way to benefit patients.  The collaboration will not only build on recent ground-breaking work of Dr. Ciulli and his team, but will also benefit from top facilities and expertise available within the School of Life Sciences at Dundee, including the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit headed by Prof. Dario Alessi, and the FingerPrint Proteomics Facility, co-directed by Prof. Mike Ferguson and Prof. Angus Lamond and managed by Dr. Douglas Lamont.  Boehringer Ingelheim is focusing on developing innovative new treatment approaches providing outstanding value for patients. To achieve this, the company is increasing its commitment to external innovation, and is working with top partners from academia and industry worldwide.

The company intends to develop a novel cancer test utilizing internal expertise and then pursue revenue-generating partnering opportunities at an early stage of development. Tumor exosomes represent small pieces of tumor cells that are released into the blood as tumors grow.  Tumor derived exosomes have phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface as a detectable marker.  It is believed that even small tumors begin to release PS-positive exosomes and thus the ability to detect these exosomes in the blood may be an indicator of the presence of a tumor.  The licensing agreement is the result of the long-standing sponsored research agreement between Peregrine and UT Southwestern focused on PS, a highly immunosuppressive signaling molecule.  The new technology licensed by Peregrine relates to assays that are able to detect small amounts of PS-exosomes in a patient blood sample as a way to potentially detect cancer at a very early stage of development. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the levels of PS-positive exosomes present in the blood of cancer patients are higher than levels found in the blood of healthy volunteers.  Furthermore, study findings also suggest that there is a correlation between the level of PS-positive exosomes detected in the blood of cancer patients and disease burden.  ""We are excited to enter into this licensing agreement with our long-term collaborators at UT Southwestern.  This technology offers a promising product development opportunity and aligns directly with the company's expertise with our proprietary PS-targeting platform and our longstanding CDMO capabilities around the development, qualification, and validation of in vitro analytical assays.  As such, there are significant opportunities to use this technology as both a complementary tool in bavituximab's ongoing development, as well as more broadly as the basis for novel cancer detection and monitoring tests that can be the focus of partnering efforts,"" said Jeff T. Hutchins, Ph.D., Peregrine's vice president, preclinical research.  ""It is important to note that this development program will require minimal capital investment and has the potential to create significant value over the next 18 months, including potential partnering opportunities.  As a result, we feel that today's licensing deal provides yet another important driver in our ongoing efforts to achieve profitability.""  Together, the Peregrine and Avid Bioservices teams have the existing infrastructure, staff and expertise to develop, optimize and validate a functional assay capable of detecting PS-positive exosomes from a blood sample.  Given the company's extensive experience in developing assays of this type, Peregrine does not anticipate the need to add personnel or any specialized equipment for this project.  The company intends to establish clinical proof-of-concept for the test and expects to initiate partnering discussions for the program in 2017. ""One of the most exciting aspects of this technology is the potential synergy that it offers with our ongoing bavituximab clinical development program.  Through our ongoing work with bavituximab, we have gained significant understanding of PS-mediated immunosuppression in cancer,"" said Joseph Shan, MPH, vice president, clinical and regulatory affairs of Peregrine.  ""The availability of a PS-specific biomarker which can be implemented in our planned future bavituximab clinical trials aligns nicely with our refocused bavituximab development strategy aimed at generating the most meaningful data possible from small, early stage clinical trials to support partnering efforts.""","Published: July 15, 2016"

The early-stage feasibility study involving sheep suggests High Intensity Focused Ultrasound   a technique already used for treating some cancers   could help a condition called Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). It was conducted by researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge, with technology being developed at The Institute of Cancer Research, London. Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome occurs in around one in seven identical twin pregnancies, and leads to one baby growing much larger than the other due to abnormal blood vessels in the placenta. Some identical twins share a placenta, which provides the babies with equal amounts of oxygen and nutrients, carried in the blood. However in TTTS the shared placenta contains abnormal blood vessels that cause more blood to flow to one baby, leaving the other deprived of oxygen and nutrients. This affects the twins' growth, and can result in complications such as premature birth, handicap or even death of one or both babies. Severe cases can be treated by using a laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels, so that each baby has a separate supply of oxygen and nutrients. However, this involves making a small hole in the womb and carries a risk of infection or miscarriage, explained Dr Christoph Lees, senior author from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial:  Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome can have tragic consequences, and in severe cases results in one tiny twin, while the other is very large   and begins to squash its sibling in the womb. Unfortunately, the little baby often does very badly   and in some cases the condition results in the loss of both twins.  Yet at the moment the only option we have for these serious cases   laser treatment - carries risk of premature birth or miscarriage. Furthermore, the laser can sometimes not reach some abnormal vessels deep in the placenta.  In the new study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the team showed that High Energy Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can selectively target and destroy placental blood vessels   potentially enabling it to split the placenta in two without the need for an invasive procedure. The technique creates a beam of high energy sound waves that generate heat, and kill cells. It is already used to treat prostate cancer and fibroids. To establish whether the procedure could destroy placental blood vessels, the team used the technique on 11 anesthetised pregnant sheep   five had the HIFU procedure while six had a placebo procedure. Although the sheep did not carry twins, the blood vessels in the sheep placenta have a similar structure to blood vessels in the human placenta, enabling the researchers to assess whether the HIFU could separate the placenta in TTTS. Furthermore, the fetuses of sheep and humans are a similar size. The results showed the technique was successful, and could destroy blood vessels without damage to the fetus. The researchers used the HIFU probe against the wall of the uterus, through an incision in the abdomen - and carried out further experiments to show the procedure works through the skin. Dr Lees added:  Although this is very early-stage research, it shows the procedure can successfully destroy blood vessels in the placenta   and could potentially stop abnormal blood flow between twin babies. We now hope to continue developing this HIFU procedure, translate these findings to humans, and work towards human trials.  The team added that because the non-invasive technique could potentially be performed at an earlier stage in the pregnancy, this could further reduce chance of complications. The laser procedure is usually performed at around five months into the pregnancy, once the womb is big enough to accommodate the laser being inserted. However, the current study suggests the procedure may work even earlier, at around three-four months into the pregnancy.

The findings, from scientists at Imperial College London, also conclude the epidemic cannot be contained with existing control measures. The team, who published their findings in the journal Science, predict the next large-scale epidemic is unlikely to emerge for at least another ten years - although there is a possibility of smaller outbreaks in this time. Professor Neil Ferguson, lead author of the research from the School of Public Health at Imperial, explained: ""This study uses all available data to provide an understanding of how the disease will unfold - and allows us to gauge the threat in the imminent future. Our analysis suggests that Zika spread is not containable, but that the epidemic will burn itself out within 2-3 years."" In the study, Professor Ferguson and colleagues from the Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial, collated all existing data for Zika transmission across Latin America. The team then used this information, alongside data on similar viruses such as dengue, to build a mathematical model to represent the current epidemic, and future waves of transmission. Using this model, the team calculated the current epidemic would end within two to three years, due to the fact people are unlikely to be infected with Zika twice. Professor Ferguson explained:  The current explosive epidemic will burn itself out due to a phenomenon called herd immunity. Because the virus is unable to infect the same person twice - thanks to the immune system generating antibodies to kill it - the epidemic reaches a stage where there are too few people left to infect for transmission to be sustained. Using our model, we predict large-scale transmission will not restart for at least another ten years - until there is a new generation in the population who have not been exposed to the Zika virus. This mirrors other epidemics, such as chikungunia - a similar virus to Zika - where we have seen explosive epidemics followed by long periods with few new cases.  The Zika virus is carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, but the team cautioned any large-scale government programmes to target the mosquitoes may have limited impact.  The virus is very similar to the dengue virus, and transmitted by the same mosquito. But previous experience with dengue has shown controlling spread to be incredibly difficult. Also, efforts to contain the epidemic would have needed to have been implemented much earlier in the current Zika epidemic to have a major effect - but by the time we realised the scale of the problem it was too late.  He added any efforts to slow spread of the virus may in fact prolong the current epidemic: ""Slowing transmission between people means the population will take longer to reach the level of herd immunity needed for transmission to stop. It might also mean that the window between epidemics - which we predict may be over a decade - could actually get shorter."" And while the potential end of the epidemic is no doubt positive, it does raise issues for vaccine development, adds Professor Ferguson: ""If our projections are correct, cases will have dropped substantially by the end of next year, if not sooner. This means by the time we have vaccines ready to be tested, there may not be enough cases of Zika in the community to test if the vaccine works."" He suggests one option may be to recruit 'sleeper sites' for vaccine trials across the globe. These centres would obtain, in advance, the lengthy legal and ethical approval needed for a trial. Then if there is a Zika outbreak in its area, a centre would be ready to begin a vaccine trial straight away.However, Professor Ferguson highlighted there are still many questions to answer about Zika - and therefore many caveats to making predictions: ""In a worst case scenario Zika would become endemic in Latin America in the long-term, which would mean smaller, frequent outbreaks. A key issue is we don't understand why the Zika virus affected Latin America in such an explosive way. One possibility is climate may have in some way aided spread of the virus, as spread coincided with an El Nino event. Genetic mutation of the virus might also have played a role, although early data currently give limited support for this hypothesis."" Professor Ferguson added that previous exposure to dengue might also have played an important role in the current Zika epidemic. Some research, including recent studies from an Imperial team, has suggested prior dengue exposure may amplify Zika infection in a person. ""This is an effect called Antibody Dependent Enhancement and is of significant concern. It is too early to say whether dengue exposure affects the risk of getting Zika or the clinical consequences of infection, but this needs to be urgently examined in future research. We also need to understand why South East Asia, which also has high rates of dengue, has not experienced a similar Zika outbreak."" He added more research is urgently needed. ""One research priority is to fully understand the extent of Zika transmission, and what proportion of people in Latin America - and across the globe have been infected. To do this we need to assess past exposure to Zika by testing blood from representative samples of at-risk populations for the presence of antibodies to the virus. We and other groups are working on such studies at the moment."" ""There are currently more questions surrounding Zika than answers - and only through a coordinated global research effort will we find the answers we desperately need.""

Now, a study published in the Journal of Pain Research finds another safe and effective drug-free treatment option for chronic pain sufferers: spinal cord stimulation (SCS). See Also: Spinal stimulation helps four patients with paraplegia regain voluntary movement Spinal cord stimulation, also known as dorsal column stimulation, uses low-voltage electrical stimulation to the spine to block the feeling of pain, via a small device implanted in the body.

The study, authored by an Australian team, looks at recent evidence for safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation in back and limb pain. The authors reviewed the scientific evidence from three studies looking at the different routes of spinal cord stimulation: dorsal root ganglion SCS, burst wave form SCS and high frequency 10 (HF10) SCS.

But in a Commentary published in Cell, two researchers call for a rigorous scientific exploration of MDMA's effects to identify precisely how the drug works, the data from which could be used to develop therapeutic compounds. ""We've learned a lot about the nervous system from understanding how drugs work in the brain both therapeutic and illicit drugs,"" says Robert Malenka, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Stanford University. ""If we start understanding MDMA's molecular targets better, and the biotech and pharmaceutical industries pay attention, it may lead to the development of drugs that maintain the potential therapeutic effects for disorders like autism or PTSD but have less abuse liability."" See Also: Training brain patterns of empathy using functional brain imaging MDMA is described as an ""empathogen,"" a compound that promotes feelings of empathy and close positive social feelings in users. The drug is a strictly regulated Schedule I compound, along with drugs such as heroin and LSD. However, MDMA's regulated status shouldn't discourage researchers from studying its effects, argue Malenka and coauthor Boris Heifets, also at Stanford. Researchers still don't know exactly how MDMA works in humans, what regions of the brain it targets, or all of the molecular pathways it affects. Malenka and Heifets don't condone the drug's recreational use, but say that scientific study to uncover its mechanisms could help explain fundamental workings of the human nervous system including how and why we experience empathy. Early clinical cases and a small trial in 2013 also showed some use for MDMA as a treatment during therapy for patients with PTSD, possibly aiding patients in forming a stronger bond with a therapist. ""Studying the response of the brain and nervous system to any drug is no different than running an animal through a maze and asking how learning and memory work, for example,"" Malenka says. ""You're trying to understand the different mechanisms of an experience. Drugs like MDMA should be the object of rigorous scientific study, and should not necessarily be demonized."" The advent of tools over the last decade such as optogenetics, viral tracing methodologies, sophisticated molecular genetic techniques, and the ability to create knockout mice have contributed to the push for more research into MDMA.

Studies using MDMA have to go through many rounds of paperwork and follow stringent safety measures to get approval, but Malenka's message is clear: it's worth it. ""There are going to be certain areas of the brain in which MDMA's actions are critical for its behavioral effects,"" says Malenka.

Credit: Dr. Thomas Liebmann, The Rockefeller University  The researchers wanted to go beyond the traditional 3D brain imaging (e.g., PET or fMRI scans), which show brain activity in a broad way, but have a low resolution overall. To circumvent this, the research team turned to a recently-developed method, called ""iDISCO."" Here, brains are soaked in a solution that imbue the fats within it with a charge, before being exposed to an electrical field with an opposite charge, which behaves like a magnet, forcing all of the fat out of the brain tissue. The result, says Flajolet, is a brain that is hard and transparent, almost ""like glass,"" which allowed the researchers to see the amyloid plaques in full detail and in 3D, in a full mouse brain hemisphere, as well as in small blocks of human brain tissue. ""In mouse models, plaques are rather small, homogenous in size and shape, and not grouped in any specific way,"" says Flajolet. ""But in the human brain, we were seeing more heterogeneity, larger plaques and these new, complex patterns."" These structures, called TAPs (three dimensional amyloid patterns) may have implications for the future of Alzheimer's disease treatment, he says. By comparing doctor's reports of a patient's symptoms with images of the patient's brain post-mortem, they may be able to classify different categories of Alzheimer's disease.

It's possible that current drugs may be beneficial only for a subset of Alzheimer patients, but we have no way to distinguish them at this day. Flajolet stressed that, moving forward, we need a better understanding of these plaques, and Alzheimer's hallmarks in general, as the relationship between their presence and the severity of the disease is not clear-cut.

Unlike most brain studies where scientists watch as people respond to cues or commands, Johns Hopkins researchers found a way to observe people's brain activity as they made choices entirely on their own. The findings, which pinpoint the parts of the brain involved in decision-making and action, online now, are due to appear in a special October issue of the journal Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making ""How do we peek into people's brains and find out how we make choices entirely on our own?"" asked Susan Courtney, a professor of psychological and brain sciences. ""What parts of the brain are involved in free choice?"" The team devised a novel experiment to track a person's focus of attention without using intrusive cues or commands. Participants, positioned in MRI scanners, were left alone to watch a split screen as rapid streams of colorful numbers and letters scrolled past on each side. They were asked simply to pay attention to one side for a while, then to the other side when to switch sides was entirely up to them. Over an hour, the participants switched their attention from one side to the other dozens of times. Researchers monitored the participants' brains as they watched the media stream, both before and after they switched their focus. For the first time, researchers were able to see both what happens in a human brain the moment a free choice is made, and what happens during the lead-up to that decision how the brain behaves during the deliberation over whether to act. The actual switching of attention from one side to the other was closely linked to activity in the parietal lobe, near the back of the brain. The activity leading up to the choice that is, the period of deliberation occurred in the frontal cortex, in areas involved in reasoning and movement, and in the basal ganglia, regions deep within the brain that are responsible for a variety of motor control functions including the ability to start an action. The frontal lobe activity began earlier than it would have if participants had been told to shift attention, clearly demonstrating that the brain was preparing a purely voluntary action rather than merely following an order. Together, the two brain regions make up the core components underlying the will to act, the authors concluded. Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisions""What's truly remarkable about this project,"" said Leon Gmeindl, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins and lead author of the study, ""is that by devising a way to detect brain events that are otherwise invisible that is, a kind of high-tech 'mind reading' we uncovered important information about what may be the neural underpinnings of volition, or free will."" Now that scientists have a way to track choices made from free will, they can use the technique to determine what's happening in the brain as people wrestle with other, more complex decisions. For instance, researchers could observe the brain as someone tried to decide between snacking on a doughnut or on an apple watching as someone weighed short-term rewards against long-term rewards, and perhaps being able to pinpoint the tipping point between the two.

In a paper published this month in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, researchers at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, with colleagues across the nation and world, have created a ""mini-brain"" model, derived from persons with a particular form of idiopathic ASD characterized by over-sized brains, revealing a defective molecular pathway during brain development that results in early neuronal overgrowth and dysfunctional cortical networks.

In this case, brain volume,"" said senior author Alysson R. Muotri, PhD, associate professor in the UCSD School of Medicine departments of Pediatrics and Cellular and Molecular Medicine. ""And early developmental brain enlargement can be explained by underlying molecular and cellular pathway dysregulation, leading to altered neuronal cortical networks."" The characteristics and causes of ASD are diverse and not entirely known facts that have made it difficult to fully uncover relevant genetic, pathologic and cellular factors that might be broadly shared. One distinct pathophysiology or disordered process is the occurrence of macrencephaly in some children with ASD, which is characterized by early neuronal overgrowth and abnormally enlarged brains. Macrencephaly occurs in the first three years of life and precedes the first clinical signs of ASD. Approximately 20 percent of ASD individuals have macrencephaly. The researchers reasoned that ASD individuals with macrencephaly likely shared an underlying molecular and cellular pathology. They created neural progenitor cells programmed from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from children with ASD. Learn more: Altered cell cycle gene activity underlies brain overgrowth in toddlers with autism ""By genome sequencing, we realized that some, but not all, carried clear mutations in the Wnt pathway, which is a molecular pathway previously implicated in cancer,"" said Muotri. ""Defects on cell cycle control were also obvious from gene expression on these cells. As a consequence, neural progenitor cells derived from these kids proliferate faster than controls, explaining the big brain phenotype."" Next, the researchers differentiated the progenitor cells into networks of cortical neurons, the primary functional cell type of the brain's cortex (gray matter). ""We showed that ASD networks fail to produce inhibitory neurons and found that several receptors and neurotransmitters related to GABA (an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter) are misregulated on these neurons. We also showed that the number of excitatory synapses is reduced, leading to functional defects when we analyzed the maturation of neuronal networks over time.

The fight against cancer has become more challenging with the rise of multidrug resistant cancers   those that have developed a defence mechanism to stop chemotherapy drugs from working. In a paper published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, it was shown how some newly discovered molecules called selenocompounds can block cancer cells  defenses against treatment, making drugs more effective. Researchers at the University of Navarra, Spain and Saarland University, Germany worked to synthesize selenium-containing compounds. Selenium is essential for the body s cells and is found in many multivitamins. Selenium deficiency can cause the bone disorder Kashin-Beck disease and the heart disorder Keshan disease. Research has also shown that taking selenium supplements can reduce the risk of some cancers. Their selenocompounds showed strong activity against cancer cells in the lab: they limited the growth of cancer cells, in some cases killing them, and stopped cancer from developing. Through a literature search a study was found that showed similar selenocompounds enhance the potency of chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment, so they investigated more in-depth. When exposed to aggressive chemotherapy drugs, some cancer cells can develop defence mechanisms   one such mechanism is a protein in the cell membrane that acts like a pump and pushes the drug back out of the cell. These proteins are called efflux pumps, and one common pump is ABCB1. Experiments showed that the selenocompounds attached to the ABCB1 efflux pumps, blocking them. They also found that the selenocompounds were able to trigger the process of cell suicide, called apoptosis, in cancer cells. The most active was just as potent as a known apoptotic compound, killing 80 percent of the cells. The ultimate aim of cancer research is to give more chances to people whose lives are at risk due to this disease. The development of pharmaceutical drugs requires a lot of effort and time, and the results of their study are just preliminary.  They hope that in the future, their work will serve as the basis to develop new drugs against cancer that reach the patients who need them.","Published: July 14, 2016"

In a new study, published July 13, 2016, in Science Translational Medicine, the researchers show how they were able to use a modified virus to deliver a small sequence of RNA called micro RNA (miRNA) that blocked the expression of the mutated protein and prevented SCA6 from developing in mice. The technique could potentially be used to treat other diseases caused by mutations in so-called ""bicistronic"" genes that produce multiple proteins, including several forms of cancer. ""We were able to very surgically strike at the toxic portion of the gene and blunt the sharp end of the spear,"" said Christopher Gomez, MD, PhD, the Albina Y. Surbis Professor of Neurology at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. ""It's a technique for shutting down disease-causing genes that could have fewer off target effects."" SCA6 is an inherited neurodegenerative disease that strikes in middle age and causes patients to slowly lose coordination of their muscles and eventually their ability to speak and stand. Human genetic studies identified its cause as a mutation in CACNA1A a gene that encodes a calcium channel protein important for nerve cell function. In 2013, Gomez and his team discovered that CACNA1A also produces a second protein,  1ACT, making it the first known human gene that codes two separate, functionally distinct proteins from one strand of messenger RNA. Normally,  1ACT enhances the growth of brain cells, but when mutated it causes brain cell death leading to SCA6. In animal models of the disease, if researchers knock out the entire CACNA1A gene, the animals do not survive more than a few weeks because they need the calcium channel protein for proper development. Yu Miyazaki, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the UChicago Department of Neurology, led the new study. The research team was able to use a modified adeno-associated virus, a small virus not currently known to cause disease, to deliver a miRNA sequence in mice with the disease-causing mutation in CACNA1A. This prevented the development of SCA6 by blocking the expression of  1ACT. Because SCA6 is an inherited disease, the findings could be used one day for screening and prevention. People with a known family history of the disease could be screened for the CACNA1A mutation and treated with a similar miRNA application. Gomez and his team are also researching other delivery mechanisms using molecules and known drugs instead of viruses. The miRNA technique may also be used to treat other diseases caused by mutations in bicistronic genes. While only a handful of others have been discovered since CACNA1A, they include genes linked to melanoma and hereditary breast cancer. ""This sets us up to be able to use the same strategy with other molecules that could suppress other genes,"" Gomez said. ""It opens many more doors that could answer how we can use it for human treatments.""","Published: July 14, 2016"

In the human body, adipose tissue acts as a primary energy store. Adult stem cells have the task of maintaining and regenerating this process. The researchers used the new lab-on-a-chip to study how adult stem cells in adipose tissue develop into mature fat cells, conducting their investigations outside the body. Previous experiments have enabled them to decode a signalling pathway involved in adipose cell maturation and to show that calories in the nutrient medium influence this process. The team has published the results of its research in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).  Going forward, we want to investigate the environmental factors   particularly the nutrient conditions   that cause different adipose cell types to grow,  explains biophysicist Dr. Matthias Meier.  This will enable us to develop new approaches to combating obesity and diabetes.  In contrast to embryonic stem cells, when adult stem cells divide, their offspring are only able to develop at the same site and in certain tissue types. Factors such as insulin and blood sugar levels also influence whether or not adult stem cells in adipose tissue will develop into mature adipose cell. Aberrations in this maturation process can lead to diabetes or obesity. The multitude of factors operating here make it very complicated, however, for scientists to investigate this process outside the body.  In order to overcome this problem, the Freiburg-based research group has developed a microfluidic chip that works with minute volumes of liquid: The platform uses microchannels to feed cell cultures with nutrients during their three-week growth period. A special feature of the set-up is an automatic protein analysis program integrated into the chip, which decodes signalling pathways during cell growth. The new technology allows the researchers to vary the external cell factors such that the micro-environment on the chip resembles conditions within the body as closely as possible. This enabled adipose-derived adult stem cells to be successfully converted into mature fat cells within the experiments, and the corresponding signalling pathway mTORC1 was also decoded.  By increasing the calorie content in the nutrient medium, we were able to show that fat is stored more rapidly during maturation,  states Meier.  However, it remains unclear whether adjusting the calorie levels in this way leads to an increased rate of adipose cell formation.  To answer this question, the research team now wants to systematically use the chip technology to study the association between human eating habits and the formation of fat cells.","Published: July 14, 2016"

For years scientists have tried with mixed success to map out PPIs to understand cellular processes. Now a team of international scientists led by Stony Brook University researchers have created an ultra-fast way to model protein interactions. The method may help pave the way to design drugs that prevent problematic protein interactions that lead to disease. The findings are published in the early online edition of PNAS.  Proteins are the major building blocks of the cell. Many proteins perform their function by interacting with other proteins. In a typical cell, hundreds of thousands of different protein interactions take place. Characterizing the structure of these interactions helps elucidate how organisms function normally and during disease development.  The problem considered is given three dimensional structures of two individual proteins to predict how these protein interact with each other,  said  Dima Kozakov, PhD, lead author and Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and a faculty member of the  Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology and Institute for Advanced Computational Science (IACS) at Stony Brook University. He likened the method to characterizing all the possible structures that pairs of  lego blocks  form out of a huge set of different individual starting blocks. In the paper titled  Protein-protein docking by fast generalized Fourier transforms on 5D rotational manifolds,  the authors explain a new algorithm used to create ultra-fast approach to modeling protein interactions. They discovered that the method runs 10 to 100 times faster than previous state-of-the-art methods, without compromising accuracy. The researchers used something called fast Manifold Fourier transform (FMFT) that help speed the calculations, enabling them to sample a large number of putative protein-protein complex conformations.  The idea behind the approach is to present proteins as a combination of quantum shapes that enable fast simultaneous analysis of many pairs using a single calculation rather than assessing each pair independently,  summarized Dr. Kozakov.  The approach can be run in under 15 minutes on a personal laptop and can be used instead of costly experimental techniques to determine the structure of the protein-protein complex.  The new algorithm will soon be available to the scientific community through the publicly available protein-protein docking server called ClusPro. This resource, with more than 15000 academic users worldwide, supported by the National Science Foundation and the Binational Science Foundation, is being developed by the same research team at the Laufer Center and IACS, in collaboration with scientists at Boston University. ClusPro was judged to be the best automated docking server in the latest rounds of the international blind protein docking competition called CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Prediction Interaction). Dr. Kozakov and colleagues believe the new method, implemented in the ClusPro server, will enable scientists to model protein interactions for the whole cell, a key step to designing drugs that prevent defective protein interactions that lead to disease.

But breeding more beneficial communities of microbes in and on crop plants may be easier in some plant tissues and growing conditions than others, finds a study led by researchers at Duke University. Mention the microbiome, and most people think of the vast army of microscopic bacteria and fungi that thrive inside the human body, helping us digest our food and fight infection. But plants are also home to millions of microbes that have a huge impact on plant health and growth. Beneficial bacteria that live in and on roots and leaves can help plants take up minerals and nutrients from the soil, fend off pathogens and withstand salt, heat and drought. Previous studies have shown that a plant s genes can shape its microbiome in the lab, but far fewer studies have measured the extent to which the plant microbiome is under genetic control in the field.  There can be thousands of different kinds of bacteria within a single leaf,  said first author Maggie Wagner, who was a graduate student at Duke at the time of the study.  The question is: what factors influence the microbes that end up living inside the plant?  To disentangle the relative effects of a plant s genes, environment and other factors, Wagner and colleagues used DNA sequencing to analyze the microbiome of a spindly wildflower called Boechera stricta where it grows wild in the Rocky Mountains. Genetically identical lines of the plant were germinated from seed in greenhouses at Duke and then transplanted as seedlings into three experimental gardens in central Idaho. Two to four years later, the researchers returned to harvest the plants. They sequenced the bacterial DNA in the roots and leaves of 440 individuals. When they compared the bacterial sequences they found to databases of known microbes, the researchers detected nearly 4,000 types of bacteria living inside the plants. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most common bacterial groups. Roots harboured two to ten times more types of bacteria than leaves. Environmental differences among sites and between years -- such as soil pH, moisture and temperature -- had the biggest influence on the plants  bacterial makeup. On average, 5 percent or less of the variation in microbial diversity was controlled by plant genetics. The influence of plant genes was stronger in the leaves than in the roots, and varied significantly from one site to another.  There s a lot of interest in harnessing the power of microbiomes for plant health, especially for crop plants,  said Wagner, now a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Plant Pathology at North Carolina State University. Agricultural companies are already coating seeds with beneficial microbes or adding them to the soil to boost the production of crops like soybean and corn and reduce our reliance on fertilizers and pesticides. These results support the idea that it is also possible to use traditional plant breeding to shape the plant microbiome. But at least for crops in the same plant family as Boechera, such as cabbage and broccoli, breeding a better microbiome may be easier in leaves than roots, and a microbial community that breeds true in one location or set of growing conditions may not be reliably inherited in others.  Microbiomes could be a very useful tool for improving agricultural productivity in the face of population growth and climate change,  Wagner said,  but designing an effective breeding program could be a lot harder than some people think it is.

Natural botanical dietary supplements such as hops have become increasingly popular among women for postmenopausal symptoms, as they are perceived as a safer alternative to hormone therapy, which has been linked to increased risk of breast cancer. However, the efficacy and potential toxicity of botanicals are still being studied. Researchers led by Judy Bolton, professor and head of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy in the UIC College of Pharmacy, applied hops extract to two different breast cell lines to see if they would affect estrogen metabolism, a key mechanism in breast cancer. One compound, 6-prenylnarigenin, or 6-PN, increased a detoxification pathway in the cells that has been linked to a lower risk for breast cancer.  We need to further explore this possibility, but our results suggest that 6-PN could have anti-cancer effects,  Bolton said. In addition to 6-PN, Bolton and her colleagues studied 8-prenylnarigenin (8-PN), isoxanthohumol (IX) and xanthohumol (XH) for their effects on estrogen metabolism in breast cells. According to Bolton, 8-PN showed only a slight increase of metabolism in breast cells, while the other two compounds did not have significant effects in either cell line. Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women in the U.S.; about one in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetime. An estimated 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 61,000 new cases of non-invasive breast cancer are expected in women in the U.S. this year, according to the American Cancer Society. The incidence of breast cancer began decreasing in 2000, after increasing during the previous two decades. Just from 2002 to 2003, the incidence declined by 7 percent. Some think the drop was partly due to reduced use of hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, after results of the Women s Health Initiative suggested a link between HRT and increased breast cancer risk. Estrogen exposure has long been linked with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, especially since the 2002 report, Bolton said.","Published: July 14, 2016"

There is also preliminary evidence that the transplantation of stool from healthy individuals can be effective in treating multiple sclerosis and Crohn s disease. At the same time, there has been a major increase in animal experiments involving fecal material. In one study, for example, researchers found that fecal transplants from lean mice turned sterile mice into lean mice, while fecal transplants from fat mice turned sterile mice into fat mice.  This research is just getting started. It is driven by the new paradigm of the microbiome which recognizes that every plant and animal species harbours a collection of microbes that have significant and previously unrecognized effects on host health, evolution and behaviour,  said Seth Bordenstein, associate professor of biological sciences and pathology, microbiology, and immunology at Vanderbilt University. In an article titled  Fecal Transplants: What is Being Transferred  just published in the journal PLOS Biology, Bordenstein reviews the growing scientific literature on the subject.  There is no doubt that poo can save lives,  said Bordenstein. Take the case of the use of fecal transplants to treat Clostridium difficile infections. According to the literature, it has a 95 percent cure rate.  Right now fecal transplants are used as the treatment of last resort, but their effectiveness raises an important question: When will doctors start prescribing them, or some derivative, first?  Bordenstein asked. It turns out fecal transplantation has a long history in Chinese medicine. An early-recorded application in humans was in the 4th century by a Chinese medical doctor named Ge Hong. In the 16th century, it was popular enough to get the nickname  yellow soup.  Interest among Western scientific circles was minimal until the year 2010, with fewer than 10 articles on the subject appearing per year in PubMed, an index of biomedical literature. Starting in 2011, however, the number began an exponential rise with more than 200 papers on fecal transplantation appearing in 2015, a trend that shows no sign of slacking. So far most of the research has been focused on the role of the bacteria in donor s stool. Bacteria are the most abundant active agent in the material. However, they are not the only functional player in feces, Bordenstein cautioned.  Feces is a complex material that contains a variety of biological and chemical entities that may be causing or assisting the effects of these transplants.  Healthy human stool contains on average 100 billion bacteria per gram. But it also contains 100 million viruses and archaea per gram (Archaea are an understudied domain of single-celled organisms that were classed as bacteria until the 1970 s). In addition, there are about 10 million colonocytes (human epithelial cells that help protect the colon) and a million yeasts and other single-celled fungi per gram. According to Bordenstein, focus on the bacterial component makes sense in some cases, such as the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis, but in other cases, such as the possible treatment of multiple sclerosis, it is quite possible that the effects of fecal transplants may be influenced by, or possibly even caused by, their non-bacterial constituents. As a result, he calls for increased research designed to separate out the effects and interactions of each of these components.  When scientists identify the specific cocktails that produce the positive outcomes, then they can synthesize or grow them and put them in a pill. That will go a long way to reducing the  icky factor  that could slow public acceptance of this new form of treatment,  said Bordenstein.","Published: July 14, 2016"

ADCs use an antibody to which a toxin/chemotherapy payload is chemically attached for targeted delivery to a tumour. Over 50 ADCs are currently in clinical development; of these, approximately a quarter are in Phase II or Phase III. The market is estimated to be worth around $1bn from two approved compounds and is expected to be worth $10bn annually by 2024. The combined potential benefits of the Affimer and PermaLink technologies have the potential to create an analogous leading protein drug conjugate platform with a number of benefits over current ADC offerings. Use of Avacta s Affimer technology (i) provides the ability to closely control the position and number of toxins in the payload; (ii) has the benefit of much shorter development times (iii) has the flexibility to  design-in  the required pharmacokinetics (the time the drug spends in the blood stream), and (iv) is much easier, more consistent and has lower cost production. The small size of the Affimer molecule is likely to also improve tumour penetration compared with antibodies which are ten times larger in size. Another major issue facing ADCs is the limited stability of chemical linkages currently used to attach the toxin to the antibody resulting in the toxin coming off the antibody and causing  off-target  and often severe, side effects. Glythera s PermaLink chemical linkers provide much more stable attachment of the toxin/chemotherapy and can potentially reduce such off-target toxicity effects. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will develop materials and methods to be used in the generation of Affimer-drug conjugates. The proof of concept study aims to demonstrate the key technical and commercial benefits of the combination over traditional antibody and linker approaches. The two companies will partner to offer Affimer-drug conjugate development services, and licensing of the combined platform, to pharmaceutical developers. Dr Alastair Smith, Chief Executive Officer, Avacta, commented:  At the half year we set out a detailed commercial strategy for Affimer reagents and therapeutics. We highlighted the importance of commercial partnerships in order to make rapid progress in the areas of strategic focus. In that context we recently announced a collaboration with Mologic to develop Affimer based lateral flow devices which would open up the rapid diagnostics market opportunity and we are very pleased to report the establishment of this collaboration with Glythera in the area of ADCs, another important application area for Affimer technology. Avacta s Affimer technology has significant benefits for drug conjugate development, and the combination of the two companies  technologies has the potential to deliver a best-in-class solution for those wishing to access such a platform. We are therefore confident that this partnership with Glythera will further demonstrate the utility of the Affimer platform as a powerful approach to generating a broad range of biotherapeutics, creating opportunities for third party licensing of the platform with the potential to generate long-term value for both companies. We continue to make good progress across all aspects of the strategy that we set out and I look forward to further updating the market in due course.  Dr Dave Simpson, Chief Executive Officer, Glythera, said:  Combining Glythera s PermaLink conjugation chemistry with Avacta s Affimer technology will demonstrate the benefits of PermaLink across a new targeting molecule class, opening additional avenues for bringing novel therapeutic assets to market. This is an exciting step forward in bio-therapeutic development, and could lead to improved patient outcomes. ","Published: July 14, 2016"

The new approach offers cancer patients the opportunity to get gene testing at one of their routine cancer clinic appointments instead of having to be referred to a separate genetic testing clinic. As well as offering a more streamlined patient journey, the pathway is less resource intensive for health systems and could save the NHS millions of pounds per year, if implemented nationally. The new testing pathway was developed by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, as part of the Wellcome Trust-funded Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics programme. It was piloted for BRCA gene testing in 207 women with ovarian cancer at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, in a study supported by the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at The Royal Marsden and the ICR, and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. Testing results sooner The study, published on Wednesday 13 July 2016 in the journal Scientific Reports, showed the new testing approach was welcomed by patients; all 207 ovarian cancer patients accepted the offer of BRCA gene testing and the post-test feedback was very positive. The new testing pathway reduced hospital visits for patients and substantially reduced the time taken for testing to be completed, ensuring the results were able to be incorporated into clinical decision making. The test results were useful in deciding medical management of four-fifths of the patients who were receiving cancer treatment. This included 32 women found to have a BRCA mutation, many of whom became eligible for new precision medicines only suitable for women with BRCA-related ovarian cancer. In the new pathway, cancer patients gave consent for testing by a cancer doctor or nurse who completed a 30-minute online training module designed by the research team. All patients found to have a BRCA mutation automatically get an appointment with the genetics team to discuss the implications for themselves and their families in detail. For each patient identified with a BRCA mutation, on average three family members also decided to see a geneticist to discuss the implications for them. BRCA mutations increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer occurring and testing in the relatives allowed individualised cancer risk information to be given to them. Relatives that also have a BRCA mutation have various options available to them to improve early detection or prevention of cancer.  New pathway 'would save millions' The new testing pathway has now become standard at The Royal Marsden and is being adopted by other hospitals in the UK and internationally. Many more women with ovarian cancer have received BRCA testing as a result. Almost all ovarian cancer patients are eligible for BRCA testing under current national recommendations, but provision of testing has been patchy across the NHS. It is estimated that less than a third of ovarian cancer patients have actually been getting testing. The simplicity and efficiency of the new testing approach would, the researchers believe, make it practical for all eligible ovarian cancer patients across the UK to be offered testing within existing resources. The researchers estimate that rolling out the new pathway across the NHS would save  2.6 million per year compared with the current standard process. A companion study to examine cost-effectiveness was led by the researchers in collaboration with DRG Abacus and AstraZeneca. The researchers showed that national implementation for all ovarian cancer patients would cost  4,339 per quality-adjusted life year   far below the  20,000 threshold that is used to decide what tests and treatments the NHS should offer. If all 7,000 women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer in the UK each year were offered testing, just a single year s testing is likely, over time, to prevent hundreds of breast and ovarian cancers and dozens of deaths in their relatives, the study found. 'Faster and simpler' Study leader Professor Nazneen Rahman, Head of Cancer Genetics at the ICR and The Royal Marsden, said:  We know BRCA gene testing can be greatly beneficial for women with ovarian cancer, allowing their care to be tailored to their individual genetic information, and improving the cancer risk information we can provide to their families.  Our new gene testing pathway is faster, simpler and better designed for cancer patients  needs than the standard NHS process. Our study has shown that it is not only a feasible way of providing BRCA testing to all eligible women with ovarian cancer, but could also prevent cancers and save the NHS millions of pounds a year.  Professor Martin Gore, Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:  The new genetic testing pathway has been a huge success in the clinic. It all runs very smoothly and I know that patients and their families are really most appreciative.  Preeti Dudakia, 49, an ovarian cancer patient at The Royal Marsden who took part in the study said:  My cancer team explained why the test was useful very clearly and when it came back positive I was able to have a treatment only given to women with a BRCA mutation. If my mother had been able to have this testing when she got ovarian cancer I would have known I was at risk sooner. My situation could have been completely different."" Prof. Paul Workman, Chief Executive of the ICR, said:  Twenty years ago the BRCA2 gene was identified at the ICR. This study is an excellent example of how science such as this can be turned into something very practical that can improve the patient care and save lives. We hope the new model for genetic testing will be rolled out across the NHS. ","Published: July 14, 2016"

In a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, the investigators showed that decreasing a set of proteins called HCN channels reduced depression-like behaviour in mice. If replicated in humans, the findings could inform fresh therapies for millions of patients who do not respond to existing treatments for depression.  Drugs currently available for treating depression help most patients, but they stop working for some patients and don t work from the get-go for others,  said senior author Dane Chetkovich, MD, PhD, professor of Neurology and Physiology.  There is a real need for new therapies to help patients desperate for alternatives to the available therapeutic options.  Most existing antidepressants affect mood and emotions by increasing levels of neurotransmitters called monoamines, namely serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. But the fact that these drugs are not effective for many patients suggests there are additional mechanisms underlying depression yet to be uncovered that could be targeted with new therapies. In previous research, Chetkovich s lab and others showed that those mechanisms might involve the hippocampus, a region of the brain important for learning, memory and emotional regulation. There, they saw that changes to HCN channels, typically involved in controlling the electrical activity of cells in the heart and brain, also played a critical role in behaviors linked to depression. In the new study, a group of Northwestern Medicine scientists led by Chetkovich took steps to translate that insight into a potential gene therapy using mouse models. The scientists surgically injected mice with a nontoxic virus engineered to express a gene that turns off HCN channel function in hippocampus neurons.  When the HCN channels stopped working, the mice behaved as if they d been given antidepressant medications,  Chetkovich explained. In contrast, increasing the function of HCN channels removed the antidepressant effect. To measure depression-like behaviour, the scientists measured how long mice would seek to escape an environment before giving up   a test commonly used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen compounds for effectiveness as antidepressants, including medications currently on the market.  This work not only identifies a totally new treatment target for depression, it provides a detailed molecular description of the structures that need to be manipulated for it to act as an antidepressant and develops viral tools to do so,  said Chetkovich, who is also director of Feinberg s Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). In future research, the scientists are focusing on adapting the viral gene therapy approach to human patients. They also have a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to find small molecules that could be developed into oral medications to turn off HCN channels in the brain.","Published: July 14, 2016"

The awards comprise the second iteration of the Martin Delaney Collaboratory: Towards an HIV-1 Cure program and are a part of President Barack Obama s pledge to invest in HIV cure research. The research program is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, all part of the NIH.  The two greatest challenges remaining in HIV/AIDS research are finding a cure and developing a safe and effective preventive vaccine. This year, NIAID has made significant investments toward both of these critical goals,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  A simple, safe and scalable cure for HIV would accelerate progress toward ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic,  he added.  Through the leadership of talented investigators with a diversity of expertise, the Martin Delaney Collaboratory program will accelerate progress in this key research endeavour.  Research toward a cure also is an overarching priority for the NIH HIV/AIDS research program. While advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have transformed HIV infection from a life-threatening disease to a manageable, chronic condition, a cure remains elusive. In 2010, NIAID established the Martin Delaney Collaboratory program in honor of the late HIV/AIDS activist Martin Delaney, a skilled and passionate advocate for cure research who served on the NIAID AIDS Research Advisory Committee. The collaboratory program supports international HIV cure research networks and encourages collaborative efforts to address the multifaceted puzzle of curing HIV. While the scientific community knows far more about HIV/AIDS since the disease was first reported more than 35 years ago, a cure remains elusive in large part because HIV has the ability to establish a reservoir in the body by inserting its genetic material into that of immune cells that have a long lifespan. The virus remains in these cells in a latent state, invisible to the immune system and to anti-HIV therapies. ART only targets HIV when it is actively replicating, so the treatment can never clear the cells containing the latent, non-replicating virus from an infected individual s blood and tissues. If an individual discontinues ART, the virus emerges from these cells and reconstitutes a widespread infection. Tackling this problem therefore requires experts with expansive knowledge of HIV pathology, genetics and the immune system. Since the first three Martin Delaney Collaboratory grants were awarded, the program has evolved to include more grants and industry partners with an increased emphasis on translational and clinical research. NIAID funded highly meritorious project applications that demonstrated elegant experimental design, leveraged investigators  expertise in the related fields of vaccine and cancer immunotherapy research and made use of public-private partnerships to ensure access to innovative new approaches. The new collaboratory projects will launch novel investigations into HIV cure strategies that include immunotherapy, therapeutic vaccines and gene modification. The awardees will utilize a variety of experimental techniques to draw HIV out of its reservoir and eliminate the virus.  These strategies include testing latency-reversing agents alone and in combination, genetically engineering immune cells to better target latently infected cells, and optimizing combinations of anti-HIV antibodies and other immunotherapeutic drugs. While each of the principal investigators  institutions are located in the United States, the collaborative projects will involve laboratories on five continents, including Africa, the first time that continent has been part of an international HIV cure research program.","Published: July 14, 2016"

In experiments using fruit flies, blocking the pathway reduced the death of brain cells, suggesting that interfering with the pathway could represent a promising new strategy to treat the disease in human patients.  Approximately 5.4 million people in the United States have Alzheimer s disease, which causes problems with memory, thinking and behaviour. One of the characteristics of the disease is that a protein called tauforms clumps, or aggregates, in the brain.   We have identified multiple new cellular processes that go awry in Alzheimer s disease because of pathological tau,  said Bess Frost, Ph.D., assistant professor, Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.  Each of these processes that connect tau with brain cell death are potential drug targets. This new knowledge will allow more informed development of therapies for the disease.  Frost will present these new findings at The Allied Genetics Conference, a meeting hosted by the Genetics Society of America.   For rational drug design, it s important to be able to discriminate between cellular events that actually cause disease, which would be good drug targets and cellular events that are only a side effect of the disease,  said Frost.  Using fruit flies allows us to do this very quickly because if we observe a process in the brains of humans with Alzheimer s, then we can block this process in a fly model of the disease and see if the fly gets better and determine if fewer brain cells die.  Studying cells from post-mortem brains of people who had Alzheimer s disease, Frost and her colleagues previously found that areas of DNA that are typically tightly wound in the cell s nucleus are instead relaxed and unwound in brain cells from Alzheimer s patients. When DNA is unwound it can switch on genes that should be turned off.  In the new study, the researchers took a closer look at the nuclei of Alzheimer s patients  brain cells to find out how the DNA becomes unwound. When the researchers used a  very high-resolution microscopy technique that let them observe the entire nucleus, they were surprised to see tunnels running through the nucleus of brain cells from people with Alzheimer s disease that were not seen in normal brain cells.   We wanted to find out if these tunnels were actually causing neurons to die or whether they were a side effect of the disease,  said Frost.  Using the fly model of Alzheimer s disease we genetically blocked the process of tunnel formation and found that indeed less brain cells died and the flies lived longer. We are now performing lab experiments to see if we can also block the process using drugs.  After identifying this first potential new drug target, the researchers continued their experiments to further elucidate this biological pathway. The cell nucleus is surrounded by what is known as the lamin nucleoskeleton, a structural scaffold made of the protein lamin. They found that when the lamin nucleoskeleton is disrupted and tunnels form, the DNA inside can no longer anchor to the nucleoskeleton and becomes unravelled. In other words, the interaction between tightly wound DNA and the nucleoskeleton is required to maintain the overall 3D architecture of the DNA. They also discovered that the tau that aggregates in the brains of people with Alzheimer s disease disrupts the lamin nucleoskeleton by overstabilizing the actin cytoskeleton found outside of the nucleus, in the cell s cytoplasm. This interrupts the normal coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and the lamin nucleoskeleton, which, in turn, causes the tightly wound DNA to relax. This causes genes to turn on that are not supposed to and, consequently, brain cells die.  By identifying the cellular processes that connect the tau aggregates with eventual cell death, the researchers opened up a number of additional new targets for therapeutic interventions.  The new work is also one of the first examples of the brain being vulnerable to problems with lamin. Some scientists have thought that the brain responded differently to aging than other tissues because people with a disease called progeria, which involves mutations in the lamin gene, experience premature aging affecting tissues all over their body except the brain.  We found that the brain is susceptible to dysfunction of the lamin nucleoskeleton, and that this disruption causes brain cells to die,  said Frost.  These findings suggest that basic mechanisms of aging are conserved between the brain and other tissues in the body. ","Published: July 14, 2016"

So could immune system problems contribute to an inability to have normal social interactions? The answer appears to be yes, and that finding could have great implications for neurological conditions such as autism-spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. See Also: The immune system, microglia, and the brain ""The brain and the adaptive immune system were thought to be isolated from each other, and any immune activity in the brain was perceived as sign of a pathology. And now, not only are we showing that they are closely interacting, but some of our behavior traits might have evolved because of our immune response to pathogens,"" explained Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, chairman of UVA's Department of Neuroscience. ""It's crazy, but maybe we are just multicellular battlefields for two ancient forces: pathogens and the immune system. Part of our personality may actually be dictated by the immune system."" It was only last year that Kipnis, the director of UVA's Center for Brain Immunology and Glia, and his team discovered that meningeal vessels directly link the brain with the lymphatic system. That overturned decades of textbook teaching that the brain was ""immune privileged,"" lacking a direct connection to the immune system. The discovery opened the door for entirely new ways of thinking about how the brain and the immune system interact. The follow-up finding is equally illuminating, shedding light on both the workings of the brain and on evolution itself. The relationship between people and pathogens, the researchers suggest, could have directly affected the development of our social behavior, allowing us to engage in the social interactions necessary for the survival of the species while developing ways for our immune systems to protect us from the diseases that accompany those interactions. Social behavior is, of course, in the interest of pathogens, as it allows them to spread. The UVA researchers have shown that a specific immune molecule, interferon gamma, seems to be critical for social behavior and that a variety of creatures, such as flies, zebrafish, mice and rats, activate interferon gamma responses when they are social. Normally, this molecule is produced by the immune system in response to bacteria, viruses or parasites. Blocking the molecule in mice using genetic modification made regions of the brain hyperactive, causing the mice to become less social. Restoring the molecule restored the brain connectivity and behavior to normal. In a paper outlining their findings, the researchers note the immune molecule plays a ""profound role in maintaining proper social function."" See Also: The neurons in our gut help the immune system keep inflammation in check""It's extremely critical for an organism to be social for the survival of the species. It's important for foraging, sexual reproduction, gathering, hunting,"" said Anthony J. Filiano, PhD, Hartwell postdoctoral fellow in the Kipnis lab and lead author of the study. ""So the hypothesis is that when organisms come together, you have a higher propensity to spread infection. So you need to be social, but [in doing so] you have a higher chance of spreading pathogens. The idea is that interferon gamma, in evolution, has been used as a more efficient way to both boost social behavior while boosting an anti-pathogen response."" The researchers note that a malfunctioning immune system may be responsible for ""social deficits in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders."" But exactly what this might mean for autism and other specific conditions requires further investigation. It is unlikely that any one molecule will be responsible for disease or the key to a cure, the researchers believe; instead, the causes are likely to be much more complex. But the discovery that the immune system - and possibly germs, by extension - can control our interactions raises many exciting avenues for scientists to explore, both in terms of battling neurological disorders and understanding human behavior. Don't Miss: Migrating immune cells promote nerve cell demise in the brain ""Immune molecules are actually defining how the brain is functioning. So, what is the overall impact of the immune system on our brain development and function?"" Kipnis said. ""I think the philosophical aspects of this work are very interesting, but it also has potentially very important clinical implications."" Kipnis and his team worked closely with UVA's Department of Pharmacology and the group of Vladimir Litvak, PhD, at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Litvak's team developed a computational approach to investigate the complex dialogue between immune signaling and brain function in health and disease. ""Using this approach we predicted a role for interferon gamma, an important cytokine secreted by T lymphocytes, in promoting social brain functions,"" Litvak said.

Proteins regulate all of the processes that keep cells alive, but when misfolded they can clump into large aggregations, a phenomenon associated with diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's. See Also: Protein clusters targeted by medications for neurodegenerative diseases actually serve to protect brain cells The team's high-throughput method allows researchers to quickly screen for genes, drugs, mutations or new conditions that influence protein aggregates, offering new ways to explore their causes and potential new therapies. ""Part of the impetus for our work is that these protein aggregations have been very difficult to study and track quantitatively,"" said Greg Newby, a doctoral student at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT, who performed the research. ""With our system, we can rapidly measure a huge population of cells and sensitively detect even rare cells that contain protein aggregates, or have dissolved protein aggregates."" Newby will present the tool, called yeast Transcriptional Reporting of Aggregating Proteins, or yTRAP, at The Allied Genetics Conference hosted by the Genetics Society of America on July 16, 2016. Protein aggregates form when tens to thousands of unstructured proteins clump together. Though seen in many types of cells, their causes and effects are not well understood. In addition to a number of serious neurodegenerative diseases, aggregates are associated with prion diseases, a class of disorders in which malfunctioning proteins act as infectious agents. At the same time, some protein aggregations have been associated with beneficial functions, such as facilitating the formation of memories and protecting cells from viruses. Learn More: Structures of Huntington s disease protein compared in study To create the new system, Newby and his colleagues developed a synthetic, or man-made, gene that causes a cell to alter its fluorescence when a protein of interest accumulates into a clump. They inserted the gene into yeast to create a population of cells that can be rapidly and automatically screened for aggregation. Left: A yeast strain containing soluble Rnq1 protein. Right: A genetically identical strain that contains Rnq1 protein aggregates. The yTRAP sensor in these strains allows sensitive detection of the solubility of Rnq1. Courtesy: Greg Newby  Existing methods used to detect protein aggregations have limited research applications because they are labor-intensive, cannot be used on living cells or do not reliably produce quantitative data. Newby said the team's new system is ready to deploy for a variety of research purposes. ""While there are always areas where we could consider expanding sensor capabilities, I think we're at a point now where anybody could use our system to track the aggregation of proteins of interest, or to screen for drugs that modulate those aggregations,"" he said. The team applied their tool to study the protein aggregates involved in Huntington's disease, a devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease. A region of the genome called huntingtin is expanded in many people with the disease; the length of this region is known to affect the timing of disease onset. The researchers were able to use expanded huntingtin in yeast to track how it influences the aggregation of other cellular factors. ""This helps us understand some of the toxic effects that Huntington's has on our cells,"" said Newby. ""We can now measure directly each protein and determine if it's being interfered with."" They also used the technology to investigate two yeast prions. They discovered genetic mutations in the prion gene capable of curing each of the prions, but were surprised to find that the mutations for the two prions were in totally separate classes. ""This tells us that the same mutations, or even the same kinds of mutations, might not be influential in affecting the aggregation of different proteins,"" said Newby. ""It suggests we might need to screen every protein individually if we want to find out how we can cause it to aggregate or stop aggregating."" Don't Miss: Yeast are first cells known to cure themselves of prions The team also applied their screening system to study a phenomenon known as prion-switching, in which populations of yeast switch to different prion states in response to an environmental stressor. The phenomenon is thought to be an adaptive mechanism that increases the population's chances of survival in the context of a rapidly-changing environment. The screening system is currently based on yeast, but Newby said the team plans to adapt it for use with cultures of human cells in the coming months. ""All of the individual components that we used, each of the synthetic proteins, should work equally well in human cells as they do in yeast,"" he said. ""We think we can move this into human cells and track human disease proteins in their native contexts."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

See Also: Neural fundamentals: Sex differences in the nervous system The insular cortex has five main parts called gyri serving different roles. The researchers found that the blood pressure response in the front right gyrus showed an opposite pattern in men and women, with men showing a greater right-sided activation in the area while the women showed a lower response. ""This is such a critical brain area and we hadn't expected to find such strong differences between men and women's brains,"" said Paul Macey, the study's lead author. ""This region, the front-right insula, is involved with stress and keeping heart rate and blood pressure high. It's possible the women had already activated this region because of psychological stress, so that when they did the physical test in the study, the brain region could not activate any more. However, it's also possible that this region is wired differently in men and women."" ""We have always thought that the 'normal' pattern was for this right-front insula region to activate more than other areas, during a task that raises blood pressure,"" added Macey. ""However, since most earlier studies were in men or male animals, it looks like this 'normal' response was only in men. The healthy response in women seems to be a lower right-sided activation."" Don't Miss: High blood pressure associated with lower risk for Alzheimer's Most studies on differences in brain functions between men and women have looked at psychological performance. In previous studies, the UCLA researchers had seen differences in heart rate and blood brain flow during blood pressure changes in men and women with obstructive sleep apnea and wanted to see if cardiovascular responses in brain areas were different in healthy men and women. In this study, researchers from the UCLA School of Nursing used the Valsalva maneuver during which participants breathe hard out through a very small tube to raise blood pressure to measure brain activity as it controls the blood pressure change. ""This raises several questions for us, such as why is there a difference in brain pattern and might it reflect differences in health issues for men and women, particularly in cardiovascular disease variations,"" Macey said.

Led by Dr. Alan Evans, a professor of neurology, neurosurgery and biomedical engineering, the researchers analyzed more than 7,700 brain images from 1,171 people in various stages of Alzheimer's progression using a variety of techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid were also analyzed, as well as the subjects' level of cognition. See Also: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein The researchers found that, contrary to previous understanding, the first physiological sign of Alzheimer's disease is a decrease in blood flow in the brain. An increase in amyloid protein was considered to be the first detectable sign of Alzheimer's. While amyloid certainly plays a role, this study finds that changes in blood flow are the earliest known warning sign of Alzheimer's. The study also found that changes in cognition begin earlier in the progression than previously believed. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease is an incredibly complex disease but an equally important one to understand. It is not caused by any one neurological mechanism but is a result of several associated mechanisms in the brain. LOAD is the most common cause of human dementia and an understanding of the interactions between its various mechanisms is important to develop treatments. Previous research on the many mechanisms that make up LOAD has been limited in scope and did not provide a complete picture of this complex disease. This study, published in the journal Nature Communications, factored in the pattern of amyloid concentration, glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow, functional activity and brain atrophy in 78 regions of the brain, covering all gray matter. ""The lack of an integrative understanding of LOAD pathology, its multifactorial mechanisms, is a crucial obstacle for the development of effective, disease-modifying therapeutic agents,"" says Yasser Iturria Medina, a post-doctoral fellow at the MNI and the paper's first author. The trajectory of each biological factor was recorded using data from each patient taken over a 30-year period. This process was then repeated 500 times to improve robustness of estimations and stability of the results. Learn More: Alzheimer s disease: Plaques impair memory formation during sleep Compiling and analyzing the data took thousands of compute hours to complete, and could not have been possible without sophisticated software and terabytes of hard drive space. Such a data-driven approach to neurology is becoming increasingly important, according to Evans. ""We have many ways to capture data about the brain, but what are you supposed to do with all this data?"" he says. ""Increasingly, neurology is limited by the ability to take all this information together and make sense of it. This creates complex mathematical and statistical challenges but that's where the future of clinical research in the brain lies."" This research also underlines the importance of data sharing across institutions, known as the Open Science model. Patient data for the study came from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a partnership of more than 30 institutions across Canada and the United States. The knowledge that this study has added to our understanding of LOAD would still be undiscovered had it not been for data sharing. Evans points out that his is just one of hundreds of scientific papers to come from the ADNI dataset. ""That by itself is justification for ADNI and data sharing,"" he says. ""What goes around comes around. We benefit from the data put in by others, and we contribute our own data."" While this study is one of the most thorough ever published on the subject of Alzheimer's disease progression, Evans says he would like to go further, to not only record but determine the causes of each mechanism, which could be the key to unlocking better treatments. It is something that is limited only by how much computer power Big Data can provide. Don't Miss: Connecting Alzheimer's disease and the immune system""This is a computational, mathematical challenge that goes beyond anything we've done so far,"" says Evans. ""Our goal is to go to a high-level, causal modeling of the interactions amongst all of the factors of disease, but you need huge computational power to do that. It's our job to be ready with the software, the algorithms, and the data while we wait for the hardware to appear."" ""We still need more data-driven integrative studies, capable of considering all possible biological factors involved, as well as of clarifying the direct interactions among these factors,"" says Medina. ""Without that, we cannot dream of effective treatments. We would continue to work in the dark."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

ImmunArray has made tremendous progress in developing a diagnostic platform that is demonstrating its capacity to transform how diseases and other conditions are diagnosed   with greater efficiency, higher levels of accuracy and enhanced simplicity,  said Eliezer Brender, chief investment officer, Exigent.  The company has assembled a very experienced and knowledgeable management team, a team that not only will continue to lead development efforts into new diagnostic arenas but also work to commercialize these products in the marketplace. As ImmunArray begins to drive revenue and reimbursements from insurers for their tests, this investment will serve to accelerate its progress.  The announcement was made during a meeting yesterday with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe at Exigent s offices. Governor McAuliffe is in Israel with his economic development team on a trade and marketing mission.  The Governor has been an avid supporter of the biotech industry during his administration and was recognized by BIO (Biotechnology Innovation Organization) as the 2016 Governor of the Year for his support in making Virginia a biotech hub.  This significant milestone for ImmunArray and Exigent is testament to the strength of the economic relationship between Virginia and Israel, as well as the innovation and energy that define our efforts to build a new Virginia economy,  said Governor Terry McAuliffe.  Our unique office related to economic development in Israel has helped us enhance our ties and create new growth and opportunities for the families we serve in Virginia and Israel.  Founded in 2006, ImmunArray has developed a series of blood-based tests using its proprietary iCHIP  technology that can determine the presence of a specific set of molecular biomarkers that are linked to particular disease or condition. The company s first commercially available test is the SLE-Key  Rule-Out Test, to definitively establish that a patient does not have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or lupus.  ImmunArray also was a grant recipient of the GE-NFL Head Health Challenge and is developing a simple test with the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to determine whether or not a person has received a concussion or other forms of traumatic brain injury.  Other tests for more chronic follow up in brain injury also are under development.  This major investment from Exigent is not only a validation of our early work, but it also allows us to accelerate and expand our commercial infrastructure, widen our reach into lupus-related products and broaden our work into other autoimmune diseases,  said Donna Edmonds, CEO and Chairman, ImmunArray.  The funding also will help us leverage our considerable progress in the area of traumatic brain injury as we move to market on that front.

Cancers can remain inconspicuous in the body for months to years before causing major problems, leading the immune system to coexist rather than to attack cancers,  explains Mayo Clinic cancer immunotherapist Peter Cohen, M.D., who co-led the study with Mayo Clinic immunologist Sandra Gendler, Ph.D., and postdoctoral fellow Soraya Zorro Manrique, Ph.D.  We tested Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists   drugs that mimic invasive bacteria   as a strategy to trick the immune system into attacking cancer as if it were a life-threatening infection. Since chemotherapy can enhance immunotherapy, we also screened the pairing of TLR agonists with over 10 different chemotherapy agents,  says Dr. Cohen, adding that the Mayo Clinic team targeted mouse models that included highly aggressive forms of breast cancer (known as 4T1) as well as pancreatic cancer (known as Panc02). The investigative team observed that when the chemotherapy agent cyclophosphamide was combined with TLR agonists, advanced 4T1 and Panc02 cancers largely regressed within two cycles of treatment and did not recur if the mice completed five additional cycles of consolidating treatment. Only the combination of the TLR agonist and cyclophosphamide resulted in permanent cancer eradication, and no other tested chemotherapy came close to working as well as cyclophosphamide. The Mayo Clinic team also reported that the combined treatment was very well tolerated and actually less toxic than either TLR agonists or cyclophosphamide given individually. Studies revealed that, even before treatment, the cancer-bearing mice had T-lymphocyte immune responses against their tumors, requiring only weekly injections of the TLR agonist and cyclophosphamide to become therapeutically effective. Importantly, the treatment agents did not need to be injected directly into tumors, and were fully effective against widespread metastases as well as the primary tumor sites. The drug combination also revealed an additional benefit   it activated monocytes (a type of white blood cell) to participate in the killing of cancer cells. Explains Dr. Gendler,  It appears very likely that each round of treatment stimulates the bone marrow to churn out freshly activated monocytes, which distribute throughout the body, spare normal cells, and find and kill cancer cells.  Dr. Cohen adds,  We were also able to identify TLR agonists that can similarly activate human monocytes to seek out and kill tumors. ","Published: July 13, 2016"

Ellen Sidransky, M.D., a senior investigator with NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and her collaborators at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), published their findings June 12, 2016 in the Journal of Neuroscience.   Until now, drugs used to treat Gaucher disease have not been able to enter the brain and reach those neurons that are affected in the most severe forms of Gaucher disease or in Parkinson s disease,  said Dr. Sidransky.  It s really exciting to have found a molecule that theoretically could be widely available to treat people with these diseases. However, there s a long distance between identifying this molecule and having an approved drug.  Dr. Sidransky has conducted research on Gaucher disease for the last 28 years and made the connection between Gaucher disease and Parkinson s disease in 2001.  Gaucher disease occurs when GBA1, the gene that codes for the protein glucocerebrosidase, is mutated. This protein normally helps cells dispose of certain fats (lipids), a type of waste produced by all cells. When a person inherits two mutated copies of GBA1, lipids accumulate and can cause symptoms such as enlargement of the spleen, frequent bleeding and bruising, weakened bones and, in the most severe cases, neurological disease. People with even one mutated copy of GBA1 are at higher risk of developing Parkinson s disease, a common disorder characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity and slowed movements. To better understand the connection between Gaucher and Parkinson s diseases, NHGRI researchers used a labour-intensive technology to develop pluripotent stem cells (unspecialized cells that can develop into various specialized body cells).  Elma Aflaki, Ph.D., a research fellow in Sidransky s lab, created stem cells from the skin cells of Gaucher patients with and without Parkinson s disease in the lab. She then converted the stem cells into neurons that had features that were identical to those in people with Gaucher disease. Neurons are nerve cells that transmit information via chemical messengers and electrical signals.  The researchers showed that the neurons from Gaucher patients, who also had Parkinson s disease, showed elevated levels of alpha-synuclein. This is the protein that accumulates in the brains of people with Parkinson s disease impacting neurons responsible for controlling movement. The researchers then looked for a molecule that would help patients with mutant GBA1 break down cellular waste. In a process known as high-throughput drug screening, researchers at NCATS Chemical Genomics Center used the Tox21 robot to evaluate hundreds of thousands of different molecules. NCATS researchers Juan Marugan, Ph.D., Samarjit Patnaik, Ph.D., Noel Southall, Ph.D., and Wei Zheng, Ph.D., identified a promising molecule, NCGC607, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, which helps to  chaperone  the mutated protein so that it can still function. In the patients  stem cell-derived neurons, NCGC607 reversed the lipid accumulation and lowered the amount of alpha-synuclein, suggesting a possible treatment strategy for Parkinson s disease.  This research constitutes a major advance,  said Daniel Kastner, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI scientific director and director of the institute s Division of Intramural Research.  It demonstrates how insights from a rare disorder such as Gaucher disease can have direct relevance to the treatment of common disorders like Parkinson s disease.  Researchers will next test the new molecule to see if it might be developed into an appropriate prototype drug for patients with Gaucher and Parkinson s diseases.","Published: July 13, 2016"

That s according to a study   ""Surfact-Stripped Frozen Phephytin Micelles for Multimodal Gut Imaging"" published July 11, 2016 in the journal Advanced Materials   which describes how chlorophyll-based nanoparticles suspended in liquid are an effective imaging agent for the gut.  Our work suggests that this spinach-like, nanoparticle juice can help doctors get a better look at what s happening inside the stomach, intestines and other areas of the GI tract,  says Jonathan Lovell, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, a joint program between UB s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB, and the study s corresponding author. To examine the gastrointestinal tract, doctors typically use X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasounds, but these techniques are limited with respect to safety, accessibility and lack of adequate contrast, respectively. Doctors also perform endoscopies, in which a tiny camera attached to a thin tube is inserted into the patient s body. While effective, this procedure is challenging to perform in the small intestine, and it can cause infections, tears and pose other risks. The new study, which builds upon Lovell s previous medical imaging research, is a collaboration between researchers at UB and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It focuses on Chlorophyll a, a pigment found in spinach and other green vegetables that is essential to photosynthesis. In the laboratory, researchers removed magnesium from Chlorophyll a, a process which alters the pigment s chemical structure to form another edible compound called pheophytin. Pheophytin plays an important role in photosynthesis, acting as a gatekeeper that allows electrons from sunlight to enter plants. Next, they dissolved pheophytin in a solution of soapy substances known as surfactants. The researchers were then able to remove nearly all of the surfactants, leaving nearly pure pheophytin nanoparticles. The drink, when tested in mice, provided imaging of the gut in three modes: photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging and positron emission tomography (PET). (For PET, the researchers added to the drink Copper-64, an isotope of the metal that, in small amounts, is harmless to the human body.) Additional studies are needed, but the drink has commercial potential because it:           Works in different imaging techniques.           Moves stably through the gut.           And is naturally consumed in the human diet already. In lab tests, mice excreted 100 percent of the drink in photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging, and nearly 93 percent after the PET test.  The veggie juice allows for techniques that are not commonly used today by doctors for imaging the gut like photoacoustic, PET, and fluorescence,  Lovell says.

Successful trials of their method at a site in Australia will inform the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. This involves CO2 from power stations and industrial sources being held deep underground, to prevent emissions from contributing to climate change. Oxygen testing In the first experiment of its kind, researchers studied the different forms of oxygen in waters sampled from rocks deep below ground at the storage site in the Otway Basin, in south eastern Australia. They found that the reservoir s waters changed their oxygen composition when in contact with bubbles of trapped CO2. Testing samples of water for this altered form of oxygen provides a simple way to measure the amount of CO2 stored within the rock. Locking away gas The study shows that injected CO2 is very quickly retained in the underground rocks, with CO2being locked away like air being trapped within a foam sponge. The research was carried out by the Universities of Edinburgh and Australian research organisation CO2CRC. Researchers say their technique provides an inexpensive monitoring solution, as they need only measure only CO2 injected into a site and water samples from before and after injection to find out how much CO2 is trapped. The study, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, was supported by the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre and CO2CRC. Our results highlight the promising potential of using oxygen compositions to monitor the fate of CO2 injected underground. This method is simple and cheap, and can be easily combined with other monitoring techniques for CCS projects in the UK and beyond.   Dr Sascha Serno, School of GeoSciences  Understanding the fate of CO2 injected into the underground for storage is essential for engineering secure CO2 stores. Our work with our Australian partners paves the way for better understanding of the fate of CO2 when we inject it underground.

""Our goal is to create tissue that can be used to replace large amounts of worn out tissue or design patches,"" said Ibrahim T. Ozbolat, associate professor of engineering science and mechanics. ""Those who have osteoarthritis in their joints suffer a lot. We need a new alternative treatment for this."" Cartilage is a good tissue to target for scale-up bioprinting because it is made up of only one cell type and has no blood vessels within the tissue. It is also a tissue that cannot repair itself. Once cartilage is damaged, it remains damaged. Previous attempts at growing cartilage began with cells embedded in a hydrogel -- a substance composed of polymer chains and about 90 percent water -- that is used as a scaffold to grow the tissue. ""Hydrogels don't allow cells to grow as normal,"" said Ozbolat, who is also a member of the Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences. ""The hydrogel confines the cells and doesn't allow them to communicate as they do in native tissues."" This leads to tissues that do not have sufficient mechanical integrity. Degradation of the hydrogel also can produce toxic compounds that are detrimental to cell growth. Ozbolat and his research team developed a method to produce larger scale tissues without using a scaffold. They create a tiny -- from 3 to 5 one hundredths of an inch in diameter -- tube made of alginate, an algae extract. They inject cartilage cells into the tube and allow them to grow for about a week and adhere to each other. Because cells do not stick to alginate, they can remove the tube and are left with a strand of cartilage. The researchers reported their results in the current issue of Scientific Reports. The cartilage strand substitutes for ink in the 3D printing process. Using a specially designed prototype nozzle that can hold and feed the cartilage strand, the 3D printer lays down rows of cartilage strands in any pattern the researchers choose. After about half an hour, the cartilage patch self-adheres enough to move to a petri dish. The researchers put the patch in nutrient media to allow it to further integrate into a single piece of tissue. Eventually the strands fully attach and fuse together. ""We can manufacture the strands in any length we want,"" said Ozbolat. ""Because there is no scaffolding, the process of printing the cartilage is scalable, so the patches can be made bigger as well. We can mimic real articular cartilage by printing strands vertically and then horizontally to mimic the natural architecture."" The artificial cartilage produced by the team is very similar to native cow cartilage. However, the mechanical properties are inferior to those of natural cartilage, but better than the cartilage that is made using hydrogel scaffolding. Natural cartilage forms with pressure from the joints, and Ozbolat thinks that mechanical pressure on the artificial cartilage will improve the mechanical properties. If this process is eventually applied to human cartilage, each individual treated would probably have to supply their own source material to avoid tissue rejection. The source could be existing cartilage or stem cells differentiated into cartilage cells.

""This study highlights both the challenges we face, and the opportunities that exist, in resolving the complex processes underlying a disease such as type 2 diabetes.""   Professor Mark McCarthy, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism The findings, published in Nature, identify several potential targets for new diabetes treatments, but also reveal the complexity of the disease that needs to be addressed by efforts to develop more personalised strategies for treatment and prevention. Type 2 diabetes is a growing threat to global health, with one in 10 people either having the disease or predicted to develop it during their lifetime. For any given individual, the risk of developing this form of diabetes is influenced by the pattern of genetic changes inherited from their parents, and environmental factors such as levels of exercise and choice of diet. A better understanding of precisely how these factors contribute to type 2 diabetes will enable researchers to develop new ways of treating and preventing this condition, as well as offering the prospect for targeting those treatments towards those most likely to benefit, and those least likely to suffer harm. Previous studies have identified over 80 areas in the genome that are associated with type 2 diabetes. However, these studies focused on the role of common DNA differences that appear frequently in the population, and they generally stopped short of identifying exactly which DNA sequence changes, or which specific genes, were responsible for this risk. Today's study explored the impact of changes in the DNA sequence on diabetes risk at a more detailed level. Some individuals had their entire genome sequenced while for others, sequencing was restricted to the part of the genome that codes directly for proteins (the exome). Scientists compared the genetic variation between individuals who had type 2 diabetes and those who did not. This allowed them to test the contribution made by rare,  private  DNA differences, as well as those that are common and shared between people. They found that most of the genetic risk of type 2 diabetes can be attributed to common, shared differences in the genetic code, each of which contributes a small amount to an individual s risk of disease. Some researchers had thought that genetic risk would instead be dominated by rare changes, unique to an individual and their relatives. This finding means that future efforts to develop a personalised approach to treatment and prevention will need to be tailored toward an individual s broader genetic profile, non-genetic risk factors and clinical features. Researchers also identified over a dozen type 2 diabetes risk genes where the DNA sequence changes altered the composition of the proteins they encode. This implicates those specific genes and proteins directly in the development of type 2 diabetes.  One such variant   in the TM6SF2 gene - has been shown to alter the amount of fat stored in the liver, which in turn results in an increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes. Discoveries such as these point to new opportunities for developing drugs that might interrupt the development of the disease. Mark McCarthy, from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford, one of three senior authors on the paper, said: 'This study highlights both the challenges we face, and the opportunities that exist, in resolving the complex processes underlying a disease such as type 2 diabetes. In this study, we have been able to highlight, with unprecedented precision, a number of genes directly involved in the development of type 2 diabetes. These represent promising avenues for efforts to design new ways to treat or prevent the disease.' Joint senior author Professor Michael Boehnke, Richard G Cornell Distinguished University Professor of Biostatistics, Director, Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, added: 'Our study has taken us to the most complete understanding yet of the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes. With this in-depth analysis we have obtained a more complete picture of the number and characteristics of the genetic variants that influence type 2 diabetes risk.' ""This large range of genetic effects may challenge efforts to deliver personalised medicine. However, to ensure that these challenges can be taken up by the wider research community, we have made the data from our study publicly accessible for researchers around the world.""  Jason Flannick, Senior Group Leader at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT  Data and discoveries generated through this project are available through the type 2 diabetes genetics portal developed as part of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership. Jason Flannick, co-lead author and Senior Group Leader at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and Research Associate at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said: 'Our study tells us that genetic risk for type 2 diabetes reflects hundreds or even thousands of different genetic variants, most of them shared across populations. This large range of genetic effects may challenge efforts to deliver personalised (or precision) medicine. However, to ensure that these challenges can be taken up by the wider research community, we have made the data from our study publicly accessible for researchers around the world in the hope that this will accelerate efforts to understand, prevent and treat this condition.'","Published: July 13, 2016"

The burden of mutations associated with these variants is comparable to an extra 21 years of sun exposure in people without this variant.   The research showed that even a single copy of a red hair-associated MC1R gene variant increased the number of mutations in melanoma skin cancer; the most serious form of skin cancer. Many non-red haired people carry these common variants and the study shows that everyone needs to be careful about sun exposure. Red-headed people make up between one and two percent of the world s population but about 6 per cent of the UK population. They have two copies of a variant of the MC1R gene which affects the type of melanin pigment they produce, leading to red hair, freckles, pale skin and a strong tendency to burn in the sun.   It has been known for a while that a person with red hair has an increased likelihood of developing skin cancer, but this is the first time that the gene has been proven to be associated with skin cancers with more mutations."" ""Unexpectedly, we also showed that people with only a single copy of the gene variant still have a much higher number of tumour mutations than the rest of the population.  This is one of the first examples of a common genetic profile having a large impact on a cancer genome and could help better identify people at higher risk of developing skin cancer.    Dr David Adams, joint lead researcher at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The researchers analysed publically available data-sets of tumour DNA sequences collected from more than 400 people. They found an average of 42 per cent more sun-associated mutations in tumours from people carrying the gene variant. This is the first study to look at how the inherited MC1R gene affects the number of spontaneous mutations in skin cancers and has significant implications for understanding how skin cancers form. It has only been possible due to the large-scale data available. The tumours were sequenced in the USA, from patients all over the world and the data was made freely accessible to all researchers. This study illustrates how important international collaboration and free public access to data-sets is to research.    Prof. Tim Bishop, joint lead author and Director of the Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology at the University of Leeds Exposure to ultraviolet light from either sunlight or sunbeds causes damage to DNA and it has been thought that the type of skin pigment associated with red-heads could allow more UV to reach the DNA.  While this may be one mechanism of damage, the study also revealed that the MC1R gene variation not only increased the number of spontaneous mutations caused by ultraviolet light, but also raised the level of other mutations in the tumours.  This suggests that biological processes exist in cancer development in people with MC1R variation that are not solely related to ultraviolet light.  This important research explains why red-haired people have to be so careful about covering up in strong sun. It also underlines that it isn t just people with red hair who need to protect themselves from too much sun. People who tend to burn rather than tan, or who have fair skin, hair or eyes, or who have freckles or moles are also at higher risk."" ""For all of us the best way to protect skin when the sun is strong is to spend time in the shade between 11am and 3pm, and to cover up with a t-shirt, hat and sunglasses. And sunscreen helps protect the parts you can t cover; use one with at least SPF15 and 4 or more stars, put on plenty, and reapply regularly.

Led by Dr. Alan Evans, a professor of neurology, neurosurgery and biomedical engineering at the Neuro, the researchers analyzed more than 7,700 brain images from 1,171 people in various stages of Alzheimer s progression using a variety of techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid were also analyzed, as well as the subjects  level of cognition. The researchers found that, contrary to previous understanding, the first physiological sign of Alzheimer s disease is a decrease in blood flow in the brain. An increase in amyloid protein was considered to be the first detectable sign of Alzheimer s. While amyloid certainly plays a role, this study finds that changes in blood flow are the earliest known warning sign of Alzheimer s. The study also found that changes in cognition begin earlier in the progression than previously believed. Late-onset Alzheimer s disease is an incredibly complex disease but an equally important one to understand. It is not caused by any one neurological mechanism but is a result of several associated mechanisms in the brain. LOAD is the most common cause of human dementia and an understanding of the interactions between its various mechanisms is important to develop treatments. Previous research on the many mechanisms that make up LOAD has been limited in scope and did not provide a complete picture of this complex disease. This study, published in the journal Nature Communications on June 21, factored in the pattern of amyloid concentration, glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow, functional activity and brain atrophy in 78 regions of the brain, covering all grey matter.  The lack of an integrative understanding of LOAD pathology, its multifactorial mechanisms, is a crucial obstacle for the development of effective, disease-modifying therapeutic agents,  says Yasser Iturria Medina, a post-doctoral fellow at the MNI and the paper s first author. The trajectory of each biological factor was recorded using data from each patient taken over a 30-year period. This process was then repeated 500 times to improve robustness of estimations and stability of the results. Compiling and analyzing the data took thousands of compute hours to complete, and could not have been possible without sophisticated software and terabytes of hard drive space. Such a data-driven approach to neurology is becoming increasingly important, according to Evans.  We have many ways to capture data about the brain, but what are you supposed to do with all this data?  he says.  Increasingly, neurology is limited by the ability to take all this information together and make sense of it. This creates complex mathematical and statistical challenges but that s where the future of clinical research in the brain lies.  This research also underlines the importance of data sharing across institutions, known as the Open Science model. Patient data for the study came from the Alzheimer s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a partnership of more than 30 institutions across Canada and the United States. The knowledge that this study has added to our understanding of LOAD would still be undiscovered had it not been for data sharing. Evans points out that his is just one of hundreds of scientific papers to come from the ADNI dataset.  That by itself is justification for ADNI and data sharing,  he says.  What goes around comes around. We benefit from the data put in by others, and we contribute our own data.  While this study is one of the most thorough ever published on the subject of Alzheimer s disease progression, Evans says he would like to go further, to not only record but determine the causes of each mechanism, which could be the key to unlocking better treatments. It is something that is limited only by how much computer power Big Data can provide.    This is a computational, mathematical challenge that goes beyond anything we ve done so far,  says Evans.  Our goal is to go to a high-level, causal modeling of the interactions amongst all of the factors of disease, but you need huge computational power to do that. It s our job to be ready with the software, the algorithms, and the data while we wait for the hardware to appear.   We still need more data-driven integrative studies, capable of considering all possible biological factors involved, as well as of clarifying the direct interactions among these factors,  says Medina.  Without that, we cannot dream of effective treatments. We would continue to work in the dark. ","Published: July 13, 2016"

""It has been dogma for decades that all dopamine neurons are somehow involved in both movement and reward, but this didn't really make sense,"" said Daniel Dombeck, the study's senior author. ""Now, it is so obvious in our recordings that there are different kinds of neurons. We can literally see this in behaving animals. Our findings will likely help answer many questions about Parkinson's disease and other neurological mysteries."" See Also: LocoMouse: Innovative tool sheds light on motor deficitsDombeck, an assistant professor of neurobiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, conducted the study with postdoctoral fellow Mark Howe. The findings provide a new framework for understanding the role of the dopamine system in movement control and learning/reward and how dysfunction of the dopamine system can result in a range of neurological disorders. Prior to this study, there was little evidence for rapid movement-locked dopamine signaling in the brain. The findings are published in the journal Nature. The scientists developed sophisticated imaging techniques to see what no one else has seen before: two distinct populations of dopamine neurons in the brain region of the striatum, one carrying signals for motor control and movement and the other transmitting signals about unpredicted (surprise) reward. The findings overturn the current model of how dopamine neurons influence behavior. ""There has always been this paradox about how dopamine does both movement and reward-based behavior,"" Howe said. ""What we found is that it does both and that there are different populations that do each one. And the neurons that do movement care about it on a very rapid timescale. These are the dynamics likely affected in Parkinson's."" Don't Miss: Impaired decision-making may contribute to motor symptoms in Parkinson's diseaseThe study provides critical information for the development of more targeted treatments of Parkinson's, a neurodegenerative disease caused by the death of dopamine neurons. Current treatments focus on replacing ambient pools of brain-wide dopamine. This study suggests that future treatments could be more effective by targeting the specific cell types, regions and timescales that appear to be most involved in movement control. Dombeck and Howe's high-resolution imaging tools enabled them to observe the dynamics of the dopamine system with unprecedented detail in active mice. In studying the animals while either running on a wheel or receiving an unpredicted reward and imaging the axons of the dopamine neurons in the striatum during those activities, the scientists were able to tease apart different dopamine axons and identify the two distinct populations. They imaged a couple of axons to many dozens of axons at a time, depending on the experiment, to see what the activity looked like. The axons related to movement and Parkinson's were active when the animal was running but not when the animal got a reward. Also, using optogenetics, the researchers showed they can control an animal's movement by shining a light on genetically labeled movement axons, showing that dopamine can trigger locomotion.

The options for treatment, after the damage is done, are limited, and predicting who will recover and how much is an elusive goal. Now, two new studies from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis indicate that current clinical practices may be missing a key aspect of stroke-induced brain damage. For some cognitive functions, such as memory and attention, the severity of a person's disability correlates with the extent of disruption to the brain's communication networks something that is not measured by most brain scans. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified One study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The other is available online in the Annals of Neurology. ""The holy grail of predicting stroke recovery is to develop an individualized algorithm that will reliably tell us, 'This patient will recover 85 percent of his abilities and that patient only 55 percent,'"" said Maurizio Corbetta, MD, the Norman J. Stupp Professor of Neurology and senior author on both studies. ""If you're trying to predict recovery for someone who has a sensory, motor or visual deficit, the scans we use today provide a lot of information. But if the patient has a memory or an attention deficit, the scans do not give you much to work with."" This research suggests that functional brain scans those that measure damage to the brain's communication network may help predict recovery and guide treatment. Corbetta, graduate student Joshua Siegel, and colleagues including Gordon Shulman, PhD, a professor of neurology, investigated whether a brain scan known as functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) could provide more useful information for assessing stroke damage. They used fcMRI to assess communication between brain areas in 130 stroke patients and in 31 people who had not experienced strokes. The technology allowed them to identify large disruptions to brain communication that occurred as a result of stroke. They also gave each participant a battery of neuropsychological tests to measure vision, motor function, language ability, visual memory, verbal memory and attention. The researchers found that the size and location of brain lesions correlated with vision and motor impairments, but problems with memory were better explained by changes to the networks of brain connections. Predicting attention and language deficits required knowing something about both the lesions and the networks. Learn More: Images of brain after mild stroke predict future risk ""We showed that the approach doctors have been using for 130 years of mapping brain lesions to symptoms only gets you so far,"" Siegel said. ""For memory, it turns out that it's not damage to a specific location that really matters but whether the connections between locations are intact."" Currently, fcMRI is not used clinically, and the kinds of MRI and CT scans used to assess stroke damage don't measure how well different brain regions work together. ""Functional MRI hasn't been used in the clinic because, before this study, there wasn't convincing evidence that these patterns of connectivity provide valuable information related to behavior,"" Corbetta said. ""Moving forward, we'll need to conduct additional studies of many more patients to show that getting functional scans in the first hours or days after a stroke could provide valuable information for predicting outcome and tracking recovery."" In a separate study, other researchers in the Corbetta lab evaluated what happens to damaged brain networks during stroke recovery. Do old pathways re-open, or are new pathways forged? Graduate student Lenny Ramsey led research focused on neglect, a kind of attention deficit that affects about a quarter of all stroke patients. People with neglect simply do not notice part of their world. Given a plate of food, for example, a person with neglect will eat only part of it and stop, thinking the plate is empty. Related: A prescription for better stroke careRamsey and colleagues studied 77 stroke patients with neglect and 31 adults of the same age who had not experienced strokes. The patients underwent fcMRI brain scans and completed a battery of neuropsychological tests at two weeks and and then three months after their strokes. The healthy adults also underwent two rounds of fcMRI scans and behavioral tests, spaced three months apart. The researchers found that as the stroke patients' symptoms of neglect lessened, the patterns of connections between parts of their brain became more similar to the patterns found in healthy people. The people with neglect who experienced the best recoveries came close to restoring normal patterns of connectivity. ""It was theoretically possible that the brain regions could recover by reorganizing and communicating in a new way, but that isn't what we saw,"" Ramsey said. ""We think that the original networks form during early development to be as efficient as possible. So when a part gets damaged, in order to get back to normal functioning, you need to restore the old wiring. Nothing else is going to work as well."" Shulman added, ""Of course, under circumstances in which critical regions and pathways are severely damaged, reorganization may be the only option."" The work suggests the possibility of treating brain damage by coaxing networks toward normal patterns of connections. Right now, treatment for stroke is centered on the first few hours, when rapid intervention with drugs or surgery can prevent brain tissue from dying. Once the damage is done, though, patients' options are limited to behavioral interventions such as physical therapy. Don't Miss: GI tract bacteria help decrease stroke Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used experimentally to aid stroke recovery. It involves sending magnetic waves through the skull and into the brain, causing an electrical current that stimulates neurons in the targeted area. While the effects of the technique are not well-understood, TMS may be able to restore normal connectivity by stimulating neurons to make more connections with each other, thereby enhancing communication between parts of the brain. ""In the past, TMS has been applied blindly in experimental stroke treatments, with no regard for what's going on in brain connectivity,"" Corbetta said. ""Our goal is to use some of the techniques we've developed in these papers to map patterns of dysfunction in individual patients, and then use those maps to guide interventions to restore normal communication between brain regions.""

The combination of two extra-low dose anticytokine drugs reduced rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events.  Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN), which normally protect the body, attack healthy cells,  said Professor Babaeva.  Patients have painful and inflamed joints. They are also at increased cardiovascular risk, particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled.  Professor Babaeva s previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Extra-low dose anti-TNF  reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNF  and anti-IFN , both at extra-low doses. The current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. It included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years. Patients were randomised to receive the combination of anti-TNF  and anti-IFN  plus standard disease-modifying therapy (38 patients) or placebo plus standard therapy (30 patients). During the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events. Patients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score, as measured by the DAS28, and more dramatic decreases in IL-1, IL-6 and TNF  than the group on standard therapy alone. The incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure) was more than double in the group on conventional disease-modifying drugs alone (37%) compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines (13%). Professor Babaeva said:  Our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways. Therefore, decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes.  For example, rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining (called endothelium), which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall, plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Increased disease activity is also linked with a pro-coagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis. Patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation, which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In patients with hypertension, target blood pressure was reached in 71% of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32% of patients on standard therapy alone. Professor Babaeva said:  This doesn t mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low.   We found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extra-low doses of antibodies against TNF  and IFN  can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk,  said Professor Babaeva. She concluded:  We do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination. In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs). We recommend this new approach for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with moderate disease activity who are not receiving the standard biologics and who do not have severe complications.

They discovered that changes in the bone marrow needed for the cancer to grow have already taken hold in the preceding condition, raising the possibility that early medical intervention could prevent this incurable type of cancer from taking root. The research, which was funded by the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, is published today in the journal Leukemia.   Myeloma affects the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that originates in the bone marrow. Diagnosed in over 4,000 people a year in the UK, fewer than half of patients survive for longer than five years after diagnosis.  Symptoms often include debilitating and painful bone damage, anaemia and nausea. Myeloma almost always progresses from an apparently benign condition known as  MGUS , which is especially common in the older population - as many as 7% of people over the age of 85 have MGUS. Only around one in 100 MGUS patients will develop myeloma each year and there is currently no way of accurately predicting which patients will do so, or when. Myeloma never spreads to other organs, suggesting that myeloma cells rely on support from other cells in the bone marrow environment to survive. The Birmingham researchers showed that early on in MGUS development, cells that make up the bone marrow connective tissue change their behaviour, and become more supportive of cancer growth. They found that a key gene, called  PADI2  becomes particularly overactive in these connective tissue cells, which leads to the overproduction of a signalling molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6). Connective tissue cells release IL-6 into the bone marrow, where it binds with receptors on the surface of cancerous plasma cells, instructing them to multiply rapidly and resist cell death signals. It is already known that the presence of high levels of IL6 in a patient s bone marrow significantly reduces the effectiveness of a key chemotherapy drug called bortezomib. The researchers believe that drugs designed to target the PADI2 gene in MGUS and myeloma patients could significantly reduce the supportive signalling that myeloma cells depend on, and may increase the effectiveness of current treatments. Significantly, the PADI2 gene has also been linked with the development of other types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer s disease and autoimmune disease, so any drug developed could have wider applications beyond myeloma treatment. Dr Daniel Tennant, who led the research at the University of Birmingham, said:  It is now clear that the bone marrow of patients with MGUS, traditionally thought of as a benign condition, is significantly different to that of healthy individuals. The bone marrow environment in these patients appears capable of supporting cancer growth, even though the majority of patients will not progress to myeloma. While this research is in the early stages, it offers the exciting possibility that early intervention could potentially delay or even prevent cancer development.  Dr Alasdair Rankin, Director of Research at the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said:  There is an urgent need for new treatments for myeloma, which, as well as being largely incurable, can have a devastating impact on quality of life. With an increasing elderly population, MGUS and myeloma are only going to become more common. Drugs designed to remove the support system myeloma uses to grow could be an effective way of treating the disease, or even preventing it altogether. ","Published: July 12, 2016"

Their goal is to identify valuable innovations from research groups around the world and develop products that address unmet needs, providing new tools that expand the possibilities of life science research. The UK facility is located on the Babraham Science Park near Cambridge. Here, CellGS is developing novel tools and technologies for exosome research. In particular, they manufacture the Exo-spin range of exosome purification kits and TRIFic assay kits and are developing additional technologies to enable exosome research.  Exosomes are small lipid spheres around 40-150 nm in diameter that form within the cell. Exosomes contain and protect various RNA and protein cargos which are secreted into the blood and other bodily fluids. Exosomes are taken up by nearby and distant cells where their cargo can profoundly influence cellular activity. Consequently, there is interest in the potential of exosomes as vectors for gene therapy. In addition, many groups are now working on diagnostic products which can detect disease based on analysis of exosomes recovered from blood, urine, saliva and other body fluids.  For CellGS, developing new processes in research through to tight quality control procedures for production items requires the best in instrumentation. Speaking to this challenge, CellGS CEO, Michael Jones, describes their particle characterization needs and why they chose the Particle Metrix ZetaView  system to perform research into exosomes.  The ZetaView  enables our scientists to assess the quality of our exosome technologies and perform vital QC steps during manufacture. We selected ZetaView  after a full evaluation of competitive nanoparticle characterization systems. For us, the benefits in using the ZetaView  compared to other systems are its ease of use and throughput of sample measurement.  The ZetaView  is a high performance integrated instrument for individual exosome particle tracking, classical micro-electrophoresis and Brownian motion. Auto-alignment and auto-focussing capabilities make the ZetaView  both fast and easy to use. A throughput of >20 samples per hour can readily be achieved. Highly resolved zeta potential and size histograms, as well as profiles, are routinely derived from thousands of particles. In addition, low concentrations of particles can be determined. The ZetaView  provides analysis certainty, leading to a better level of exosome characterization and enabling new discoveries in microvescicle and exosome research. ","Published: July 12, 2016"

As the only start-up selected to present at the event, Biomunex unveiled a case study and novel data demonstrating that its optimized bispecific antibodies possess excellent drug-like properties, optimal functional activity and can be assembled without extensive antibody engineering; i.e. confer Plug-and-Play properties. There are various different bispecific antibody platforms, however very few are capable of producing bispecific antibodies with good manufacturability and also lack of steric hindrance when binding its two targets   properties that are required for successfully producing new therapeutic candidates. Moreover, the vast majority of bispecific antibody formats do not permit the use of existing antibodies; instead they require the selection of binding domains from specially prepared antibody libraries, which does not allow the Plug-and-Play approach, a very attractive feature for pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Zhukovsky presented data on ten different BiXAb antibodies, representing several therapeutic programs at Biomunex, confirming the optimal manufacturability of BiXAb. In accelerated degradation studies, the biophysical properties of BMX-002, a therapeutic candidate in Biomunex  lead program, remained unchanged for over one month, demonstrating the excellent stability of BiXAb molecules. The in vitro results also indicate that the BiXAb platform possesses excellent 'Plug and Play' properties (i.e. modularity). Moreover, BMX-002 exhibited synergistic activity on its two targets and demonstrated superior in vivo efficacy and survival compared to that of the anti-EGFR + anti-HER2 mAbs combination. As BiXAbs are stable, do not degrade or aggregate for extended periods of time, and demonstrate modularity and excellent functional activity, the BiXAb platform is highly attractive for therapeutic development. During the previous two years of research, Biomunex has been engaged in the optimization of the bispecific antibody format licensed from European academic collaborators into a robust and unique proprietary platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies with superior activity and drug-like properties. Biomunex continues to expand its IP position on the BiXAb platform and its proprietary antibodies. At the beginning of 2016, Biomunex filed two patent applications for its two lead BiXAb antibodies.  Proof of concept preclinical studies on BMX-002 have demonstrated the advantageous properties of our lead candidate, with optimal manufacturability, e.g. good expression level in CHO cells similar to that of parental antibodies, structural integrity and thermal stability, and lack of aggregation,  said Dr. Zhukovsky.  We are delighted to have been selected to present at the next generation therapeutics event, where key players in the therapeutic development field were discussing the best antibody platforms.   Our BiXAb platform is an excellent choice for the generation of therapeutic antibodies. It provides a substantial advantage over most of the competing formats. We have shown that products generated based on our proprietary platform will bear the manufacturing, stability and activity profiles that antibody developers, pharma and biotech companies, are looking for,  said Dr. Gerard, CEO of Biomunex.  These promising results will help us nominate our first development candidate for the treatment of pancreatic and other solid tumor cancers in 2016. They will also facilitate the advancement of our second program, directed at the treatment of hematological malignancies and exploiting the clinically demonstrated power of immune checkpoint inhibitors.  The Next Generation Protein Therapeutic Summit, the industry's most comprehensive review of innovative therapeutic approaches, goes beyond the scope of antibodies. It provides coverage of the discovery, engineering and development of novel protein therapeutics and their latest successes in the clinic. The 2016 event showcased more than 40 presentations and case studies with new data, including Biomunex data related to its BiXAb platform.

The study has been published this week in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the most prestigious journal in the clinical immunology area. Systemic autoinflammatory diseases comprise a set of rare diseases characterized by the presence of recurrent acute inflammatory episodes that result from the deregulation of control of the inflammatory process. These diseases occur as a result of mutations in different genes related to innate immune response and inflammation. The three diseases that the term CAPS includes are Familial Cold Autoinflamatory Syndrome or FCAS, Muckle-Wells syndrome and Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) or Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous Articular Syndrome (CINCA). All CAPS patients have mutations in the encoding gene cryopyrin, a key protein in the process of inflammation. Although the presence of mutations is common, not all patients present with the same clinical features or respond equally to drug treatment. The study, which was mainly carried out by Drs Roser Vento-Tormo, Damiana  lvarez-Errico and Antonio Garc a-G mez, has not only shown that CAPS patients have alterations in the DNA methylation-dependent control of inflammation genes in their monocytes, but also that the immunological treatments received by these patients are able to restore methylation levels to those observed in healthy individuals. Since all CAPS patients neither have the same clinical features nor respond equally to treatment with immune drugs, the observed changes in the DNA methylation open up possibilities for the development of novel biomarkers with clinical uses, including a better characterization of patients as well as a follow-up in their response to treatments.","Published: July 12, 2016"

Developed by scientists in the Division of Biomedical Informatics and the Center for Clinical and Translational Science Training at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center, the database has the potential to help reduce negative side effects from prescription drugs and identify opportunities to reposition existing drugs for new uses, report the study s authors. Calling their new database AERSMine, researchers said the tool allows anyone from physicians to the general public to rapidly find, combine and analyse the growing volume of drug information stored in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s Adverse Reporting System (FAERS).  AERSMine offers an open aperture approach that can reveal unexpectedly better or worse clinical outcomes associated with different drug regimens for some groups of patients, and to facilitate the ultimate goal of protecting patients by improving therapeutic selections and monitoring strategies,  said Mayur Sarangdhar, PhD, study first author and a research associate in the Division of Biomedical Informatics at Cincinnati Children s.  It also conserves valuable therapeutics by minimizing harmful interaction choices.  Although the FDA s database offers an extensive array of reports and related data on the clinical use of drugs and adverse effects, study authors said that current methods for information retrieval and analysis are difficult  running the risk of losing statistical power and the ability to detect important differential effects. AERSMine is designed for easy use and supports analysis of millions of clinical records containing details on drug exposures, disease indications, and clinical outcomes. Researchers said the tool is expected to strengthen access to and analysis of drug safety and effectiveness data. It also has the potential to discover improved uses of individual drugs or drug combinations and develop novel treatments for diseases.  One of the capabilities that makes AERSMine different from any other clinical data mining system is its ability to use knowledge frameworks   ontologies  to form the groupings of patients, medications, and outcomes and gain what we believe is an unprecedented power to explore and identify both unexpectedly negative and positive drug effects. Doing this has the potential to uncover new uses for drugs and drug regimen combinations,  said Bruce Aronow, PhD, senior study author and co-director of the Computational Medicine Center at Cincinnati Children s. Using the database The researchers evaluated the effectiveness and utility of the data mining tool by running a series of analyses involving both known side effects as well as more complex scenarios focused on improved use of three important classes of drugs and clinical disorders: 1) lithium   used to treat manic depression/bipolar disorder; 2) anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs   used to treat inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis; 3) NSAIDs   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used for pain management. Their analysis of lithium, for example, showed that 22,575 patients had used lithium with a total of 4,180 adverse drug events. AERSMine-dissected data shows that 327 adverse events significantly correlated with patients that use lithium, including aggression, anger, suicidal tendencies, tremors, irritability, etc., have a significantly reduced rate of occurrence in patients taking angiotensin receptor blocks (ARBs, usually taken to control hypertension). The intriguing possibility suggested by AERSMine analysis then is that ARBs could result in a reduction of these sometimes lethal outcomes of bipolar patients taking lithium. When the authors studied the use of NSAIDs for arthritis, chronic pain, etc., they were able to see differential rates of adverse clinical events depending on if people used propionic acid derivatives (like ibuprofen) or so-called cox-2 inhibitors known as coxibs, and patient groups for whom the risks of NSAID adverse events are much lower than others (for example patients with chronic arthritis).

This allows the molecular basis for drug-related adverse events to be detected, leveraged, and used to identify opportunities for repositioning drugs for new clinical uses.

The grant will fund the development of advanced computerized image analysis methods to mine sub-visual image features through the digitization of whole slide images (WSI). According to Inspirata Founder and Executive Vice President, Dr. Mark Lloyd,  This grant was written and awarded based on the increased need for predictive and prognostic assays that can now be developed through recent advances in digital pathology and computational image analysis methods. These image-based assays can be used to grade the aggressiveness of an individual s disease signature, which means that patients with less aggressive cancers can be spared more aggressive treatments like chemotherapy.  Today s treatment guidelines for women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer is chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy like Tamoxifen . In spite of this one-size-fits-all approach, it is widely believed that at least 50 percent of ER+ breast cancer patients actually receive no remission or curative benefit from the chemotherapy portion of their treatment and, in fact, would benefit more from having hormone therapy alone. Being able to accurately and cost-effectively identify this subgroup of women can avoid unnecessary chemotherapy and spare these patients its accompanying negative side effects. Currently, there is a genetic test developed by Genomic Health, Inc., called OncoType Dx (ODx), which can identify the 50 percent of ER+ breast cancer patients who will not benefit from chemotherapy. However, this test is expensive, costing roughly $4,000/patient; it must be conducted in a specialized facility of which there is only one in the U.S.; it only tests a small region of the tissue so it can miss key information; and it requires 10-14 days to deliver results. The CHIP assay that Inspirata and CWRU are developing and validating uses a digital image of the patient s tissue sample and evaluates the entire expanse of the tumor region with image analysis algorithms. These algorithms assess morphological features like texture, shape, and structure of glands and nuclei to ascertain which early-stage ER+ breast cancer patients are candidates for hormone therapy alone and which must receive adjuvant chemotherapy. This process doesn t destroy the tissue, takes minutes vs. weeks to deliver a result, can be made available globally and would be substantially cheaper than ODx.  This grant is a major boost for cancer imaging research at CWRU, and it also reflects the fact that we are leading the way in translational research and academic-industry partnerships,  says Principle Investigator Dr. Anant Madabhushi, Professor and Director of the Center of Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at CWRU.  We are delighted to be partnering with Inspirata to develop image-based risk predictors of aggressiveness in ER+ breast cancers based off of H&E stained pathology images alone.  Dr. Madabhushi is the founder of CCIPD at CWRU and is currently conducting research on more than 30 projects, including ones sponsored by the Department of Defense, NIH, NSF and the QED. CCIPD is involved in various different aspects of developing, evaluating and applying novel quantitative image analysis, computer vision, signal processing, segmentation, multi-modal co-registration tools, pattern recognition, and machine learning tools for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and theragnosis in the context of breast, prostate, head and neck, and brain tumors as well as epilepsy and carotid plaque. The group also is exploring the utility of these methods in studying correlations of disease markers across multiple scales, modalities, and functionalities from gene and protein expression to spectroscopy to digital pathology and to multi-parametric MRI. Additionally, Drs. Michael Feldman (UPenn) and Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers) are co-Principle Investigators on the grant; and Drs. Hannah Gilmore (CWRU), Pingfu Fu (CWRU), John Tomaszewski (SUNY Buffalo), Mark Lloyd (Inspirata) and James Monaco (Inspirata) are co-Investigators.  Inspirata will use its quality management systems and production software standards to create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay,  says Dr. Lloyd.  Additionally, we will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the CHIP assay in the U.S. and abroad. ","Published: July 12, 2016"

It's a big problem for water quality and biodiversity in lakes and society, and we have to get a handle on how we restore these lakes, says associate professor and co-editor of the special issue, Kasper Reitzel, Department of Biology, University of Southern Denmark. Together with colleagues, Sara Egemose and Henning S. Jensen, who are experts in lake restoration, they are associated with Villum Kann Rasmussen Centre of Excellence, Centre for Lake Restoration (CLEAR). The special issue of Water Research regarding this topic has contributions from 60 authors from 12 countries. Risen to alarming levels In a press release, the journal writes: ""Phosphorus is the main cause of deterioration of water quality around the world. This results in ""dead zones"", toxic algal blooms, loss of biodiversity and increased health risks for plants, animals and people who come in contact with contaminated water. After decades of runoff from agriculture, sewers and industry, the content of phosphorus in our lake beds has risen to alarming levels. The extent of the problem is daunting, and although attempts to reduce runoff have been made, about 10 million tonnes of extra phosphorous is released into our fresh water every year. Long-term monitoring activities show that plant and animal life is often not restored, even as the phosphorus input decreases. This is because the phosphorus is superimposed in sediment, from which it may be released back to the lake water. "" Geo-engineering can help the lakes Geo-engineering covers the methods used to restore the lakes for phosphorus pollution.  Often the methods attempt to change the chemical bonding of phosphorus in the lake bed, for example, by adding aluminium salts or modified clay to the lake. But the results are not always good. For example, geo-engineering is sometimes used indiscriminately in lakes because the external phosphorus load has not been reduced enough, because of economic reasons, or have used low doses, says Sara Egemose, Department of Biology, University of Southern Denmark. In the special issue presents a scientific assessment of the various geo-engineering methods. This knowledge, scientists from CLEAR in collaboration with Nature Agency translated into a set of guidelines for restoration of Danish lakes.","Published: July 12, 2016"

The process is maintained by  progenitor  cells   the progeny of stem cells   that divide and  differentiate  into fully-functional skin cells to replenish dying skin. These cells are in turn supported by a smaller population of  stem cells , which remain silent, ready to become active and repair skin when it becomes damaged. However, when this process goes awry, cancers can arise: damaged DNA or the activation of particular genes known as  oncogenes  can trigger a cascade of activity that can lead ultimately to unchecked proliferation, the hallmark of a cancer. In some cases, these tumours may be benign, but in others, they can spread throughout the body   or  metastasise    where they can cause organ failure. Until now, there has been intense interest in the scientific field about which types of cell   stem cell, progenitor cell or both   can give rise to tumours, and how those cells become transformed in the process of tumour initiation and growth. Now, in a study published in Nature, researchers led by Professor C dric Blanpain at the Universit  Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, and Professor Ben Simons at the University of Cambridge, have demonstrated in mice how skin stem and progenitor cells respond to the activation of an oncogene. Their studies have shown that, while progenitor cells can give rise to benign lesions, only stem cells have the capacity to develop into deadly invasive tumours. The researchers used a transgenic mouse model   a mouse whose genes had been altered to allow the activation of an oncogene in individual stem and progenitor cells. The oncogene was coupled with a fluorescent marker so that cells in which the oncogene was active could be easily identified, and as these cells proliferate, their  daughter  cells could also be tracked. These related, fluorescent cells are known as  clones . By analysing the number of fluorescently-labelled cells per clone using mathematical modelling, the team was able to show that only clones derived from mutant stem cells were able to overcome a mechanism known as  apoptosis , or programmed cell death, and continue to divide and proliferate unchecked, developing into a form of skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma. In contrast, the growth of clones derived from progenitor cells becomes checked by increasing levels of apoptosis, leading to the formation of benign lesions.  It s incredibly rare to identify a cancer cell of origin and until now no one has been able to track what happens on an individual level to these cells as they mutate and proliferate,  says Professor Blanpain.  We now know that stem cells are the culprits: when an oncogene in a stem cell becomes active, it triggers a chain reaction of cell division and proliferation that overcomes the cell s safety mechanisms.   While this has solved a long-standing scientific argument about which cell types can lead to invasive skin tumours, it is far more than just a piece of esoteric knowledge,  adds Professor Simons from the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.  It suggests to us that targeting the pathways used in regulating cell fate decisions   how stem cells choose between cell proliferation and differentiation   could be a more effective way of halting tumours in their tracks and lead to potential new therapies.

In their report published online in Cancer Discovery the researchers describe how interactions among fat cells, immune cells and connective tissue cells in obese individuals stimulate a microenvironment that promotes tumour progression while blocking the response to chemotherapy. They also identify a treatment strategy that may inhibit the process.   We evaluated the effects of obesity on numerous aspects of tumour growth, progression and treatment response in several animal models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and confirmed our findings in samples from cancer patients,  says Dai Fukumura, MD, PhD, of the Steele Laboratory of Tumour Biology in the MGH Department of Radiation Oncology, the study's co-senior author.  Along with finding that tumours from obese mice or patients exhibited elevated levels of adipocytes or fat cells and of desmoplasia, both of which fuel tumour progression and interfere with treatment response, we also identified the underlying cause.  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and more than half of patients diagnosed with PDAC are overweight or obese. Among patients with PDAC, obesity more than doubles the already high risk of death. Previous research by the MGH team and others has shown that PDAC is characterized by elevated desmoplasia   with an overproduction of extracellular matrix tissue by pancreatic stellate cells   which both promotes the survival and migration of cancer cells and blocks the penetration of chemotherapy drugs into tumours. Obesity itself is known to contribute to desmoplasia, with the expansion of fat tissue leading to inflammation and fibrosis and an accumulation of fat within the normal pancreas, which also causes inflammation. The team s experiments revealed that the elevated desmoplasia in obese mouse models of PDAC was caused by activation of pancreatic stellate cells through the antiogensin II type-1 receptor (AT1) signalling pathway. This activation was promoted by production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 ) both by fat cells and by the immune cells called neutrophils within and around tumours. Inhibiting AT1 signaling with losartan, which is used clinically to treat hypertension, reduced obesity-associated desmoplasia and tumour growth and increased the response to chemotherapy in the obese mouse model but not in normal weight animals. Analysis of tumours from human PDAC patients revealed increased desmoplasia and fat deposits only in samples from obese patients, and data from more than 300 patients showed that excess weight was associated with a reduction in patients  response to chemotherapy.  Jo o Incio, MD, PhD, of the Steele lab, lead author of the study, says,  Understanding the way that obesity affects pancreatic cancer may help us identify biomarkers   such as body weight and increased levels of tumour fibrosis   that could identify patients for whom AT1 blockers or IL-1  antibodies would be most beneficial. Since FDA-approved versions of both agents are readily available, this strategy could be readily translated into the clinic. In addition, incorporating body weight into the design of preclinical studies could better account for the lack of response to conventional chemotherapeutical drugs.  Co-senior author Rakesh K. Jain, PhD, director of the Steele Laboratory, adds,  With the majority of pancreatic cancer patients being overweight or obese at diagnosis, uncovering potential therapeutic targets within the mechanisms associating obesity with poor cancer prognoses is the first step towards developing remedies that could disrupt this association and significantly improve patient outcome. Targeting inflammation and fibrosis holds the promise to improve the clinical outcome of this major group of cancer patients.

In combination with chemically induced neural stimulation, axons grew further than in strategies tried previously. Treated mice partially regained visual function. The study also demonstrates that adult regenerated central nervous system (CNS) axons are capable of navigating to correct targets in the brain. The research was funded through the National Eye Institute (NEI), a part of NIH.  Reconnecting neurons in the visual system is one of the biggest challenges to developing regenerative therapies for blinding eye diseases like glaucoma,  said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.  This research shows that mammals have a greater capacity for central nervous system regeneration than previously known.  The optic nerve is the eye s data cable, carrying visual information from the light-sensing neurons of the retina to the brain. Like a bundle of wires, it consists of about a million axons that each extend from an individual retinal ganglion cell. A variety of optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma, cause vision loss when they destroy or damage these axons. In adults, retinal ganglion cell axons fail to regrow on their own, which is why vision loss from optic neuropathies is usually permanent. The researchers induced optic nerve damage in mice using forceps to crush the optic nerve of one eye just behind the eyeball. The mice were then placed in a chamber several hours a day for three weeks where they viewed high-contrast images essentially changing patterns of black lines. The mice had modest but significant axonal regrowth compared to control mice that did not receive the high-contrast visual stimulation. Prior work by the scientists showed that increasing activity of protein called mTOR promoted optic nerve regeneration. And so they wondered if combining visual stimulation with increased mTOR activity might have a synergistic effect. Two weeks prior to nerve crush, the scientists used gene therapy to cause the retinal ganglion cells to over express mTOR. Optic nerve crush was performed and mice were exposed to high-contrast visual stimulation daily. After three weeks, the scientists saw more extensive regeneration, with axons growing through the optic nerve as far as the optic chiasm, a distance from the eye of about 6 millimeters. Encouraged by these results, the researchers again increased mTOR activity but then forced mice to use the treated eye during visual stimulation by suturing shut the good eye. This combined approach of increasing mTOR activity with intense visual stimulation promoted regeneration down the full length of the optic nerve and into various visual centers of the brain. We saw the most remarkable growth when we closed the good eye, forcing the mice to look through the injured eye,  said Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., associate professor, Stanford University School of Medicine s department of neurobiology, and lead author of the report, published online in Nature Neuroscience. In three weeks, the axons grew as much as 12 millimeters, a rate about 500 times faster than untreated CNS axons. The regenerating axons also navigated to the correct brain regions, a finding that Huberman said sheds light on a pivotal question in regenerative medicine:  If a nerve cell can regenerate, does it wander or does it recapitulate its developmental program and find its way back to the correct brain areas?  Using transgenic mouse lines designed to express fluorescent proteins only in specific retinal ganglion cell subtypes (about 30 exist), the investigators traced where regenerating axons went.  The two types of retinal ganglion cells that we looked at    -cells and melanopsin cells   seemed fully capable of navigating back to correct locations in the brain, plugging in and forming synapses,  said Huberman.  And just as interesting, they didn t go to the wrong places.  Fluorescent axons appeared in brain regions where  -cells and melanopsin cells would be expected but were absent in other regions. Visual function was partially restored in animals that received visual/mTOR combination therapy. The investigators used four tests to assess four types of visual perception: ability to track moving objects, pupillary reflex, depth perception, and ability to detect an overhead predator   a stimulus that normally causes mice to freeze or flee for cover. Mice treated with combination therapy performed significantly better than untreated mice in two of the four tests.  This study s striking finding that activity promotes nerve regrowth holds great promise for therapies aimed at degenerative retinal diseases,  noted Thomas Greenwell, NEI program director for retinal neuroscience research. Greenwell said the research has great relevance to the NEI Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a sustained effort to develop regenerative medicine for retinal diseases. For future therapies that preserve optic nerve axons, Huberman envisions the development of filters for virtual reality video games, television programs, or eyeglasses designed to deliver regeneration-inducing visual stimulation. A drawback of the optic nerve crush model is that it does not mimic typical blinding diseases or injuries. The investigators are therefore currently examining the effect of intense visual stimulation in a mouse glaucoma model. Going forward, they are homing in on the specific qualities of visual stimulation that drive retinal regeneration. This research was funded by NIH grant EY026100 and the Glaucoma Research Foundation.","Published: July 12, 2016"

It is especially frequent among children, athletes, and the elderly. Now, scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have shown that a single dose of a new molecule they developed can effectively protect the brain from inflammation, cell death, and cognitive impairments that often follow a mild traumatic brain injury. See Also: MRI shows 'brain scars' in military personnel with blast-related concussionBecause it lacks visible external signs or objective structural brain damage, mTBI is an under-diagnosed injury. Yet it is often accompanied by long-lasting cognitive, behavioral and emotional difficulties associated with biochemical and cellular changes. While most symptoms of mTBI are substantially resolved within days or weeks of the injury, up to 50% of mTBI patients experience symptoms at one-year post-injury. These can include psychological symptoms, subjective cognitive impairments, and somatic (physical) complaints. These changes could result from an increase in glutamate levels, oxidative stress, opening of the blood-brain-barrier, and in particular inflammatory activity followed by cell death (apoptosis). Currently there is no effective treatment for patients with mTBI. ""It is widely known that external or internal injury strongly activates the inflammatory response and leads to apoptosis through the MAPK pathways, which are involved in the cellular responses that lead to inflammation in brain cells,"" explains Prof. Daphne Atlas, from the Department of Biological Chemistry in the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""Therefore, for reversing the effects of mTBI it is essential to calm the inflammatory pathways."" At her laboratory in Jerusalem, Prof. Atlas has developed new molecules derived from the active site of Trx1, called thioredoxin-mimetic peptides (TXM-peptides). Thioredoxin (Trx1) is a major protein that maintains the oxidation/reduction state of the cells. In its reduced form it is bound to another protein (ASK1), which is released upon oxidation of Trx1 and activates a chain of enzymatic reactions that lead to inflammation. The newly-synthesized thioredoxin-mimetic peptides (TXM-peptides) have been shown to protect cells from early death via the activation of inflammatory pathways. Comprising 3 or 4 amino acids, these peptides have dual activity: they mimic the antioxidant activity of Trx1, and simultaneously inhibit the activity of enzymes called MAPK within the inflammatory pathway, preventing inflammation and cell death. Learn More: Athletes may have white matter brain changes 6 months after a concussionTXM-CB3 was previously shown to effectively lower MAPK activity in animal models of asthma and in the brain of rat model of diabetes [Kim et al 2011; Bachnoff et al 2011; Cohen-Kutner et al 2013, 2014]. The peptides managed to cross the blood-brain barrier and improve the condition of brain cells by lowering the inflammatory processes. In the current study published in PLoS One, Prof. Atlas and colleagues explored the impact of TXM-peptides, TXM-CB3 and TXM-CB13 (DY70; provided by OneDay Biotech and Pharma Ltd), on preventing mTBI cognitive secondary injury. The experiments were performed in collaboration with researchers at Tel Aviv University, Prof. Chagi Pick and Dr. Renana Baratz-Goldstein. Researchers induced cognitive impairments in anesthetized mice by a weight drop resulting in mild traumatic brain injury. The mice showed a decrease in spatial memory in the Y-maze test and a loss in visual learning ability in the novel object recognition test. Lower learning ability was also detected 30 days post injury in the mTBI mice. In these two independent tests, a single dose of either one of the TXM-peptides administered 60 minutes post-injury, at a 50 mg per kg of body weight, significantly improved the decline in cognitive performance and learning ability at 7 and 30 days post injury. In addition, the two TXM-peptides were found highly effective at inhibiting the MAPK activity in neuronal cells grown in tissue culture. Don't Miss: Women show persistent memory impairment after concussion""This research demonstrates the potential for TXM-peptides to significantly reduce cognitive impairment after mild traumatic brain injury,"" said Prof. Atlas. ""Further studies are required to establish and examine the potential of a single dose of TXM-peptide in preventing damage if administered even one hour after brain trauma in human scenarios for example, in chronic traumatic encephalopathy observed in American football players, which result from multiple concussions and other types of blows to the head. ""Another advantage to using peptides is in significantly reducing the risk of causing toxic effects, because they consist of amino acids which are the natural building blocks comprising cell proteins, in contrast to the use of drugs that are not natural. So TXM-CB3 and TXM-CB13 are promising treatment candidates to prevent secondary damage that affect brain function,"" said Prof. Atlas. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

When triggered with ultraviolet light, the molecule glows much brighter, which enables real-time monitoring of amyloid fibrils as they aggregate in lab experiments. Rice chemist Angel Mart  said such a powerful probe could be a boon to researchers seeking a way to break up amyloid plaques, which form in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's.

Aggregating amyloid fibrils glow green with the addition of fluorescent metallic complexes synthesized at Rice University. The complexes glow when attached to the fibrils and exposed to ultraviolet light, giving researchers a way to monitor aggregation in real time.

""This dye does the complete opposite, increasing its emission even more every time you excite it."" The effect isn't nearly as strong if the metallic molecule is either floating in a solution or attached to single amyloid strands, he said. The effect is seen in two stages, he said. The probe incorporates a hydrophobic part that naturally binds to aggregating fibrils and emits light when it does, giving researchers a clear signal that aggregation is happening.

The Rice researchers suspect the dramatic increase happens when reactive oxygen species attack the amino acids on the amyloid beta fibril that would normally quench the luminescence of the metal complex. ""Our hypothesis is that upon ultraviolet irradiation, our (rhenium) metal complex produces reactive oxygen species and they're more aggressive than conventional molecular oxygen,"" Aliyan said. ""There are reports that rhenium complexes are capable of activating oxygen from one form to a more aggressive form in solution."" ""That's one of our theories,"" Mart  added. ""We still don't understand well what is happening. But we know that besides increasing the emission intensity, the complex also chemically modifies the (amyloid) protein."" Mart  said experiments that removed as much oxygen as possible eliminated the enhanced fluorescence effect. He said the lab stepped back to test an earlier metallic complex based on ruthenium, which also showed emission when attached to amyloid fibrils. It did not show enhanced emission under ultraviolet light. ""We thought the effect might be happening with ruthenium and we had completely missed it, so we ran a control experiment and nothing happened,"" he said. That makes the rhenium complex unique so far. It also gives researchers the opportunity to learn more about amyloid beta proteins and the mechanics of aggregation, Mart  said. ""We've always been interested in knowing where these complexes bind,"" he said. ""If they oxidize amyloid beta in the periphery of their binding site, then by tracking the place of oxidation we will know the place of binding. That is called footprinting. It will allow us to specifically explore binding and how chemical modification of the surface of the protein would affect factors like toxicity and aggregation."" Don't Miss: New amyloid-reducing compound could be a preventive measure against Alzheimer s Aliyan said the probe allows real-time protein aggregation study as the probe turns on upon aggregation. ""To the naked eye, aggregation is not obvious,"" he said. ""You need a probe to follow the process and see if potential drugs can inhibit aggregation or make it faster or slower. Then you can run assays with or without any drug and in a variety of conditions. One would think if there are ways to modify amyloid beta aggregation, maybe there are ways to treat the process.""

The method now needs validation in larger groups of patients, say the researchers. The findings appear in the journal PLOS ONE. Lead author was Dr. Gerhard Johnson, with VA and the University of Minnesota. See Also: Study demonstrates those who suffer from Gulf War Illness, including its cognitive symptoms, have imparied mitochondrial function As many as 300,000 U.S. veterans about 4 in 10 of those who deployed to the Persian Gulf during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in the early 1990s are now estimated to have Gulf War Illness, more than 25 years later. That figure comes from a VA survey, based on veterans' self-reported symptoms, published earlier this year. But the illness is still difficult to define and diagnose, and there is no broad agreement on the diagnostic criteria, let alone an exact cause. Commonly reported symptoms include pain, fatigue, mental fog, memory problems, headaches, insomnia, and gastrointestinal problems. Chronic inflammation in the body may be the chief underlying culprit, or at least one of the key factors driving the illness, suggests the new study. The study found that several commonly used blood tests all indicating inflammation tended to yield different results between veterans who reported symptoms consistent with Gulf War Illness, and those who did not. The researchers suggest that a panel of such markers, once validated in further research, could serve as an objective biomarker for the condition. This could help clinicians diagnose the illness. It could aid further research as well. As of now, different research groups use different criteria for determining who has the condition, and that may hamper progress. Learn More: Can light therapy help the brain? The study involved 57 Gulf War veterans who met the current diagnostic criteria for the illness, and 28 who did not. They were mostly white, male, and middle-aged. The researchers tested the volunteers' blood samples for red, white, and platelet counts, and for more than 60 different proteins. Three types of white blood cells lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils were all higher in the Gulf War Illness group. Platelets small cells that form clots to heal injured blood vessels were also elevated. Along with these changes, six different proteins found in the blood showed significantly different values between the two groups. Levels of C-reactive protein, leptin, BDNF, and MMP-9 were higher in the Gulf War Illness group. Levels of two other proteins MMP-2 and H-FABP were lower. Three of the markers used together lymphocytes, monocytes, and C-reactive protein yielded a predictive value of 90 percent for those veterans whose probability of Gulf War Illness was 70 percent or more based on clinical interviews. In other words, the test indicated the presence of Gulf War Illness in 90 percent of those who appeared to have the condition based on conventional diagnostic criteria. Taken together, write the researchers, the results ""support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation is a component of the pathophysiology of [Gulf War Illness]."" Dr. Ronald Bach, the senior author on the study, said, ""The fact that so many significant blood biomarker differences were detected in a relatively small study supports the conclusion that we are seeing a strong signal of a well-defined chronic inflammatory disease.""

In combination with chemically induced neural stimulation, axons grew further than in strategies tried previously. Treated mice partially regained visual function. The study also demonstrates that adult regenerated central nervous system (CNS) axons are capable of navigating to correct targets in the brain. The research was funded through the National Eye Institute (NEI), a part of NIH. See Also: 'Brainbow' reveals startling data about visual connections in brain ""Reconnecting neurons in the visual system is one of the biggest challenges to developing regenerative therapies for blinding eye diseases like glaucoma,"" said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, MD, PhD. ""This research shows that mammals have a greater capacity for central nervous system regeneration than previously known."" The optic nerve is the eye's data cable, carrying visual information from the light-sensing neurons of the retina to the brain. Like a bundle of wires, it consists of about a million axons that each extend from an individual retinal ganglion cell. A variety of optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma, cause vision loss when they destroy or damage these axons. In adults, retinal ganglion cell axons fail to regrow on their own, which is why vision loss from optic neuropathies is usually permanent. The researchers induced optic nerve damage in mice using forceps to crush the optic nerve of one eye just behind the eyeball. The mice were then placed in a chamber several hours a day for three weeks where they viewed high-contrast images essentially changing patterns of black lines. The mice had modest but significant axonal regrowth compared to control mice that did not receive the high-contrast visual stimulation. Don't Miss: Eye cells may use math to detect motion Prior work by the scientists showed that increasing activity of protein called mTOR promoted optic nerve regeneration. And so they wondered if combining visual stimulation with increased mTOR activity might have a synergistic effect. Two weeks prior to nerve crush, the scientists used gene therapy to cause the retinal ganglion cells to overexpress mTOR. Optic nerve crush was performed and mice were exposed to high-contrast visual stimulation daily. After three weeks, the scientists saw more extensive regeneration, with axons growing through the optic nerve as far as the optic chiasm, a distance from the eye of about 6 millimeters. Encouraged by these results, the researchers again increased mTOR activity but then forced mice to use the treated eye during visual stimulation by suturing shut the good eye. This combined approach of increasing mTOR activity with intense visual stimulation promoted regeneration down the full length of the optic nerve and into various visual centers of the brain. ""We saw the most remarkable growth when we closed the good eye, forcing the mice to look through the injured eye,"" said Andrew Huberman, PhD, associate professor, Stanford University School of Medicine's department of neurobiology, and lead author of the report, published in Nature Neuroscience. In three weeks, the axons grew as much as 12 millimeters, a rate about 500 times faster than untreated CNS axons. The regenerating axons also navigated to the correct brain regions, a finding that Huberman said sheds light on a pivotal question in regenerative medicine: ""If a nerve cell can regenerate, does it wander or does it recapitulate its developmental program and find its way back to the correct brain areas?"" Related: Making artificial vision look more natural Using transgenic mouse lines designed to express fluorescent proteins only in specific retinal ganglion cell subtypes (about 30 exist), the investigators traced where regenerating axons went. ""The two types of retinal ganglion cells that we looked at -cells and melanopsin cells seemed fully capable of navigating back to correct locations in the brain, plugging in and forming synapses,"" said Huberman. ""And just as interesting, they didn't go to the wrong places."" Fluorescent axons appeared in brain regions where  -cells and melanopsin cells would be expected but were absent in other regions. Visual function was partially restored in animals that received visual/mTOR combination therapy. The investigators used four tests to assess four types of visual perception: ability to track moving objects, pupillary reflex, depth perception, and ability to detect an overhead predator a stimulus that normally causes mice to freeze or flee for cover. Mice treated with combination therapy performed significantly better than untreated mice in two of the four tests. ""This study's striking finding that activity promotes nerve regrowth holds great promise for therapies aimed at degenerative retinal diseases,"" noted Thomas Greenwell, NEI program director for retinal neuroscience research. Greenwell said the research has great relevance to the NEI Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a sustained effort to develop regenerative medicine for retinal diseases. Learn More: Eye s motion detection sensors identified For future therapies that preserve optic nerve axons, Huberman envisions the development of filters for virtual reality video games, television programs, or eyeglasses designed to deliver regeneration-inducing visual stimulation. A drawback of the optic nerve crush model is that it does not mimic typical blinding diseases or injuries. The investigators are therefore currently examining the effect of intense visual stimulation in a mouse glaucoma model.

Language, as one of the most complex functions of the brain, is not seated in a single brain region but involves connections between many regions. In an article published in the Journal of Neuroscience, investigators at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the University of South Carolina (USC) report that mapping all of the brain's white matter connections after stroke, in addition to imaging the areas of cortical tissue damage, could better predict which patients will have language deficits and how severe those deficits will be. The totality of the brain's connections is referred to as the connectome. Learn More: Brain s iconic seat of speech goes silent when we actually talk ""Imaging the connectome of patients after stroke enables the identification of individual signatures of brain organization that can be used to predict the nature and severity of language deficits and one day could be used to guide therapy,"" said MUSC Health neurologist Leonardo Bonilha MD, PhD, senior author on the article, whose laboratory focuses on connectome imaging, particularly as it relates to language loss after stroke. Grigori Yourganov, PhD, is the first author on the article. Julius Fridriksson, PhD, Chris Rorden, PhD, and Ezequiel Gleichgerrcht, PhD, aphasia researchers at USC who recently received National Institues of Health (NIH, U.S.) funding to establish a Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery and who are long-time collaborators of the Bonilha laboratory, are also authors on the article. This study is the one of the first to use whole-brain connectome imaging to examine how disruptions to white matter connectivity after stroke affect language abilities. White matter fiber tracts are the insulated wires that connect one area of the brain to others. White matter is named for the myelin sheaths (insulation) that cover the many axons that make up the fiber tracts. Don't Miss: Cooling technique protects speech during brain surgery""If you have two brain areas and both of them have to work together in order to carry out a function and the stroke lesion takes out axons that connect those brain areas--the two areas are intact but the communication between them is disrupted and so there is dysfunction,"" said Yourganov. Currently, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used after stroke to assess lesions in the cortical tissue the brain's gry matter. However, the extent of cortical damage often does not correlate with the severity of language deficits. ""Stroke patients sometimes have significant impairments beyond the amount of cortical damage,"" said Bonilha. ""It is also hard to predict how well a patient will recover based on the cortical lesion alone."" Could connectome-based imaging be a useful complement for assessing damage to the brain's connections after stroke and for guiding rehabilitative therapy? Related: Culturing the connectome The study led by Bonilha took an important first step toward answering these questions. The study, which enrolled 90 patients at MUSC and USC with aphasia due to a single stroke occurring no less than six months prior, assessed four areas related to speech/language using the Western Aphasia Battery speech fluency, auditory comprehension, speech repetition, and oral naming as well as a summary score of overall aphasia. Within two days of behavior assessment, each of the patients underwent imaging studies both T1- and T2- weighted MRI, typically used after stroke to map cortical damage, and diffusion imaging, used for connectome mapping. The team then used a type of machine learning algorithm support vector regression (SVR) to analyze the imaging results and make predictions about each patient's language deficits. In essence, an algorithm was created that could derive the WAB score from either a feature relevant to imaging of the gray matter damage by structural MRI or a feature relevant to connectome imaging of the brain's white matter fiber tracts. The team used 89 of the 90 patients as training sets for SVR and then used the algorithm to predict language defect/preservation in the 90th patient. This was done for each of the 90 patients and, in each patient, for both features identified via structural MRI and connectome imaging. The accuracy of the algorithm's prediction of WAB score for each patient was then assessed by comparing it to the WAB score determined via behavioral testing. Connectome-based analysis was as accurate as cortical lesion mapping for predicting WAB scores. In fact, it was better at predicting auditory comprehension scores than was lesion-based imaging using structural MRI and only slightly less accurate at predicting speech fluency, speech repetition, and naming scores. Don't Miss: Patients improve speech by watching 3-D tongue images The study demonstrates that damage to the white matter fiber tracts that connect the brain's regions plays a role beyond cortical damage in language impairment after stroke. Furthermore, this study also discloses that connections in the brain's parietal region are particularly important for language function, especially fluency. This region is less likely to sustain damage after stroke, even in patients who experience aphasia, suggesting that damage or preservation of the brain's connections in this region could play a key role in determining who will experience aphasia and who will have the best chances for recovery. The integrity of these connections could not be mapped with conventional structural MRI but can now be assessed through connectome-based analysis. The study findings also suggest that connectome-based analysis could be used to inform a more individualized approach to stroke care. Because the algorithms developed using these study patients as the training set are generalizable to a broader stroke population, connectome-based analysis could one day be used to identify the distinctive features of each patient's stroke which connections have been lost and which preserved and then the algorithm could be used to predict the type and severity of language impairment and the potential for recovery. This information could then be used to direct rehabilitative therapy to improve outcomes.

Using new techniques to grow cells, scientists can make models which will better resemble the tissue architecture and complexity of human tumours than the cell lines used today.  As part of NCI s Precision Medicine Initiative in Oncology, this new project is timed perfectly to take advantage of the latest cell culture and genomic sequencing techniques to create models that are representative of patient tumours and are annotated with genomic and clinical information. This effort is a first step towards learning how to use these tools to design individualised treatments.    Dr Louis Staudt, director of NCI s Center for Cancer Genomics Scientists will make the models using tissue from patients with different types of cancer, potentially including rare and children s cancers, which are often under-represented or not available at all in existing cell line collections.  This exciting new project means that we can expand our resources for researchers around the world. We want scientists to have the best resources to be able to easily study all types of cancer. And these new cell lines could transform how we study cancer and could help to develop better treatments for patients.    Dr Ian Walker, Cancer Research UK s director of clinical research The new models have the potential to reflect the biology of tumours more accurately and better represent the patient population. The tumour and the derived models will be genetically sequenced. Researchers will have access to this information, as well as the anonymised clinical data about the patients and their tumour. The HCMI collaborators aim to speed up development of new models and to make research more efficient by avoiding unnecessary duplication of scientific efforts.  New cancer model derivation technologies are allowing us to generate even more and improved cancer models for research. A concerted and coordinated effort to make new models will accelerate this process, while also allowing for rapid learning, protocol sharing, and standardised culturing methods.

Led by scientists from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and the Netherlands Cancer Institute, the international study discovered a strong link between many mutations in patient cancer samples, and the sensitivity to particular drugs. This could advance personalised cancer medicine by leading to results that help doctors predict the best available drugs, or the most suitable clinical trials for each individual patient. In the first systematic, large-scale study to combine molecular data from patients, laboratory cancer cell lines and drug sensitivity, the researchers looked at genetic mutations known to cause cancer in more than 11,000 patient samples of 29 different tumour types.  They built a catalogue of the genetic changes that cause cancer in patients and mapped these alterations onto 1000 cancer cell lines. Next, they tested the cell lines for sensitivity to 265 different cancer drugs to understand which of these changes effect sensitivity. The researchers made two significant discoveries. Firstly, that the majority of molecular abnormalities found in patient s cancers are also found in cancer cells in the laboratory. This means that cell lines are indeed useful models to identify which drugs would work best for patients. Secondly, many of the molecular abnormalities detected in the thousands of patient cancer samples can, both individually but also in combination, have a strong effect on whether a particular drug affects a cancer cell s survival. The results suggest cancer cell lines could be better exploited to learn which drugs offer the most effective treatment to which patients.  In this study we compared the genetic landscape of patient tumours with that of cancer cells grown in the lab. We found that cell lines do carry the same genetic alterations that drive cancer in patients. This means that drug sensitivity testing in cell lines can be used to figure out how a tumour is likely to respond to a drug.    Dr Mathew Garnett, joint leader of the study from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Previous studies have sequenced the DNA of cancers from patients to identify the molecular abnormalities that drive the biology of cancer cells. Researchers have also shown that large collections of cancer cell lines grown in the laboratory can be used for measuring sensitivity to many hundreds of drugs. However, this is the first study to systematically combine these two sets of information.  If a cell line has the same genetic features as a patient s tumour, and that cell line responded to a specific drug, we can focus new research on this finding. This could ultimately help assign cancer patients into more precise groups based on how likely they are to respond to therapy. This resource can really help cancer research. Most importantly, it can be used to create tools for doctors to select a clinical trial which is most promising for their cancer patient. That is still a way off, but we are heading in the right direction.    Dr Francesco Iorio, joint first author and postdoctoral researcher at both EMBL-EBI and the Sanger Institute  We need better ways to figure out which groups of patients are more likely to respond to a new drug before we run complex and expensive clinical trials. Our research shows that cancer cell lines do capture the molecular alterations found in tumours, and so can be predictive of how a tumour will respond to a drug. This means the cell lines could tell us much more about how a tumour is likely to respond to a new drug before we try to test it in patients. We hope this information will ultimately help in the design of clinical trials that target those patients with the greatest likelihood of benefiting from treatment.

The new study The Mitochondrial Unfoldase-Peptidase Complex ClpXP Controls Bioenergetics Stress and Metastasis which was published recently in PLOS Biology, revealed that researchers were able to turn off individual subunits within the network, which significantly reduced the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread, suggesting an attractive new therapeutic target. As the primary energy-producing organelle within cells, mitochondria are critical for every organism, yet how they function in cancer is still not entirely known. This is of particular importance because, in general, tumour cells proliferate more than normal tissues, and scientists have speculated that mechanisms that preserve mitochondrial function are responsible for supporting tumour expansion.    We show that tumour mitochondria manage their set of proteins by assembling an integrated network of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, that controls both the folding and degradation of proteins,  the authors wrote. Previous studies have provided evidence that an increased proteostatic threshold is associated with disease, especially cancer, by safeguarding against the risk of stress related to the biosynthetic needs of transformed cells. ""This is an example of how tumours can quickly adapt to cope with their own higher biosynthetic needs,"" explained senior study author Dario Altieri, M.D., president and CEO of The Wistar Institute and director of The Wistar Institute Cancer Center. ""Mitochondria play a crucial role in a tumour's ability to process the energy needed to grow and spread, so identifying the mechanisms of how tumours maintain the function of mitochondria and exploit it to support abnormal cell proliferation and metastatic spread may uncover new therapeutic targets in a wide variety of cancers.""  Using a proteomics screen, we now show that the mitochondrial unfoldase-peptidase complex ClpXP associates with the oncoprotein survivin and the respiratory chain Complex II subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) in mitochondria of tumour cells,  the authors penned.  Knockdown of ClpXP subunits ClpP or ClpX induces the accumulation of misfolded SDHB, impairing oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production while activating  stress  signals of 5  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and autophagy.  It has also been known that tumours hijack the mechanisms of proteostasis to their advantage, yet exactly how this happens in mitochondria had remained largely unknown. The new network described by the Wistar investigators answered this question and confirmed its important role in tumour development. In particular, one of the components of this network ClpP  was found to be overexpressed universally in primary and metastatic human cancer and correlates with shortened patient survival. Shockingly, the Wistar team identified the overexpression of this subunit in breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancers as well as melanoma and lymphoma. ""There's quite a bit of interest in targeting pathways involved in mitochondrial function, and we've identified one such pathway that may provide a 'druggable' target for a variety of cancers,"" noted lead study author Jae Ho Seo, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Altieri s laboratory. ""Other studies have shown that it is feasible to target mitochondrial proteins in preclinical models, so disrupting the network we identified in this study could shut off key processes that lead to tumour progression.""","Published: July 11, 2016"

To some degree, heritability depends on environmental conditions, such as nutritional insult during early-life development, that affect the genome at the epigenetic level, where gene expression can be enhanced or suppressed depending on the accumulation of chemical changes that affect genes without altering underlying DNA sequences. While epigenetic changes are of intense interest, such changes in certain parts of the genome have been relatively overlooked. And it turns out that one part of the genome ribosomal DNA (rDNA) may acquire epigenetic modifications early in an organism s life, with life-long consequences. Specifically, a type of epigenetic change called DNA methylation may occur depending on the environment in the womb, affecting an offspring s attributes, such as birth weight. This finding emerged from a study led by researchers at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). It confirms that environmental factors in the in utero environment play a role alongside genetic factors in determining an offspring s attributes. When offspring are in the womb, what their mothers experience environmentally (for example, diet, stress, and smoking), influences the attributes of offspring when they are adults. This  developmental programming  is understood to be a large contributor to the obesity epidemic seen today. The QMUL described the rDNA dimension to this kind of epigenetic inheritance in an article ( Early-Life Nutrition Modulates the Epigenetic State of Specific rDNA Genetic Variants in Mice ) that appeared July 7 in the journal Science.  We show that protein restriction in mice from conception until weaning induces a linear correlation between growth restriction and DNA methylation at ribosomal DNA (rDNA),  wrote the authors.  This epigenetic response remains into adulthood and is restricted to rDNA copies associated with a specific genetic variant within the promoter. Related effects are also found in models of maternal high-fat or obesogenic diets.  The authors added that their work has established rDNA as a genomic target of nutritional insults. ""The fact that genetic variation of rDNA seems to play such a major role suggests that many human genetics studies could be missing a key part of the puzzle,  asserted Vardhman Rakyan, Ph.D., a professor at QMUL and the current study s lead researcher.  These studies only looked at a single copy part of individuals' genomes and never at rDNA.  This could be the reason why we've only so far been able to explain a small fraction of the heritability of many health conditions, which makes a lot of sense in the context of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.  The QMUL researchers found that when cells are stressed for example, when nutrient levels are low they alter protein production as a survival strategy. In the study s low-protein mice mothers, the researchers saw that mothers  offspring had methylated rDNA. This slowed the expression of their rDNA, which could be influencing the function of ribosomes and resulted in smaller offspring, as much as 25% lighter. ""Looking beyond the epigenetic markers, when we looked at the basic genetic sequence of the rDNA, we found an even bigger surprise,  added Professor Rakyan.  Even though all the mice in the study were bred to be genetically identical, we found that the rDNA between the individual mice was not genetically identical, and that even within an individual mouse, different copies of rDNA were genetically distinct. So there is huge variation in rDNA which is also playing a big role in determining the attributes of offspring.  In any given genome, there are many copies of rDNA, and Professor Rakyan and colleagues found that not all copies of the rDNA were responding epigenetically. In offspring from mothers who were fed on low-protein diets, it was only one form of rDNA the A variant that appeared to undergo methylation and affect weight. This means that the epigenetic response of a given mouse is determined by the genetic variation of the rDNA those who have more A variant rDNA end up being smaller. The findings also complement other studies that have found that mice that are put on high-fat diets have offspring who show increased rDNA methylation. This suggests that methylation is a general stress response and may also explain the rise in obesity that is happening across the world.","Published: July 11, 2016"

All are driven by cells and genes that escape the normal process of division and begin their own plan to replicate in the body. Advances in genetics and molecular biology are providing researchers with better knowledge of the genetic mutations and cell alterations that can lead to cancer, and also how to utilize that information to develop preventive measures and therapies to target the diseases.  Moffitt Cancer Center, a leader in molecular cancer research, and a research team led by Jia Fang, Ph.D., assistant member of the Tumor Biology Department, has discovered a new way to control the activity of SETDB1, a protein that is often upregulated in cancer. Their findings have been published in the June 16 issue of Molecular Cell. The novel mechanism to control the protein function is called monoubiquitination. Proteins can be regulated by a process called ubiquitination, in which an ubiquitin molecule is added to a protein. Ubiquitin modification can result in a number of different effects. The addition of many ubiquitin molecules can target a protein for degradation, while the addition of a single ubiquitin molecule (monoubiquitination) can lead to activation of protein signaling pathways or target other proteins for ubiquitination.  Ubiquitin is usually added to a protein through an ordered series of events   activation by an E1 enzyme, conjugation by an E2 enzyme and ligation by an E3 enzyme. SETDB1 regulates the level of DNA compaction and gene expression.  When SETDB1 is active, the expression levels of target genes are repressed.  Given its critical role in controlling gene expression, SETDB1 must be precisely regulated to ensure that molecular processes run properly.  Moffitt researchers performed molecular studies to show for the first time that SETDB1 is constitutively modified by a single ubiquitin molecule. The ubiquitination event is mediated directly by E1 and E2 enzymes, without the traditional involvement of an E3 enzyme. Importantly, this monoubiquitination serves as an integral part of SETDB1 to render its activity and leads to inhibition of target gene expression.  This is the first demonstration that a constitutive monoubiquitination by an E2 enzyme complements the function of a key enzyme. These results suggest that this class of E2 enzymes is an attractive target for cancer therapeutics,  said Fang.","Published: July 11, 2016"

We are thrilled to have the opportunity to help lead this far-reaching, transformative program of one million or more U.S. participants with long-term follow up,  said the new grant s principal investigator Eric Topol, MD, who is director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI), professor of genomics at TSRI and chief academic officer at Scripps Health.  Our focus at STSI for the decade of its existence has been to advance individualized medicine. Using genomics, mobile apps and biosensors and providing data back to each participant, this study will set the foundation for new medical knowledge and ways of engaging people in research as citizen-scientists.   This grant, which will total almost $120 million over five years, is one of the largest federal grants ever awarded to TSRI,  said TSRI CEO Peter Schultz, PhD,  and it represents the expanding leadership role that Eric and TSRI will play in this new era of biomedical research.  The five-year award is part of the Cohort Program of President Obama s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI); the PMI Cohort Program is a landmark longitudinal research effort that aims to engage one million or more U.S. participants to improve the ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetics.  STSI already has played a pivotal role in a digital medicine revolution that is radically transforming the way we think about and provide health care,  said Chris Van Gorder, president and CEO of Scripps Health, which operates STSI in partnership with TSRI.  This grant ensures the continuation of that work for years to come on a scale that will benefit the entire nation.  The new grant will support a Participant Technologies Center through STSI that will play a key role in enrolling participants in the study, as well as providing mobile applications. In parallel, the center will develop platforms to deliver these same functions to those without smartphones and work with various technology organizations to increase smartphone accessibility. STSI has partnered with the NIH-funded Vibrent Health of Fairfax, Virginia, which will provide the technology platform to enrol and engage participants through mobile apps, web app, interactive voice response, feature phones and wearable sensors; Vibrent Health will develop, test, maintain and upgrade the technology platform to enrol, consent, collect data from, communicate with and retain participants throughout the grant period. In addition, Seattle-based Sage Bionetworks, an integral partner in the design, development and data hosting for many of the mobile-app-based research studies on Apple s open source ResearchKit platform, will be responsible for developing symptom measurements from phone, wearable and other sensors, as well as community outreach and participant engagement efforts with the Participant Technologies Center. The initiative also includes an extensive network of high-profile partners including Walgreens and PatientsLikeMe. Working collaboratively with other entities, the Scripps Participant Technologies Center will be responsible for enrolment of at least 350,000 participant-volunteers.  These partners provide unparalleled outreach and engagement, along with data privacy and security capabilities,  Topol said. The team aims to begin initial enrolment into the study this year, with the aim of meeting its enrolment goal by 2020. Participants will be invited to answer questions about their health history and status, share their genomic and other biological information through simple blood and urine tests and grant access to their clinical data from electronic health records. In addition, mobile health devices and apps will provide lifestyle data and environmental exposures in real time. All of this will be accomplished with essential privacy and security safeguards. As partners in the research, participants will have ongoing input into study design and implementation, as well as access to a wide range of their individual and aggregated study results.  This range of information at the scale of 1 million people from all walks of life will be an unprecedented resource for researchers working to understand all of the factors that influence health and disease,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  Over time, data provided by participants will help us answer important health questions, such as why some people with elevated genetic and environmental risk factors for disease still manage to maintain good health, and how people suffering from a chronic illness can maintain the highest possible quality of life. The more we understand about individual differences, the better able we will be to effectively prevent and treat illness.  The knowledge gained from the PMI Cohort Program will extend successes of precision medicine in some cancers to many other diseases. Importantly, the program will focus not just on disease, but also on ways to increase an individual s chances of remaining healthy throughout life.","Published: July 11, 2016"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-plants-sense-electric-fields-197250,How Plants Sense Electric Fields An international group of researchers has identified the sensor plants use to sense electric fields  The voltage sensor discovery could contribute to the understanding of how the Ebola virus enters human cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The cells of plants, animals and humans all use electrical signals to communicate with each other. Nerve cells use them to activated muscles. But leaves, too, send electrical signals to other parts of the plant, for example, when they were injured and are threatened by hungry insects. ""We have been asking ourselves for many years what molecular components plants use to exchange information among each other and how they sense the changes in electric voltage,"" says Professor Rainer Hedrich, Head of the Chair for Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics at the University of W rzburg. Results published in Plant Biology This question has been intriguing Hedrich since the mid 1980s when he was still a postdoc in the laboratory of Erwin Neher at the Max Planck Institute in G ttingen. ""Back then, we used the patch clamp technique to make the first-time discovery of an ion channel in plants which is activated by calcium ions and an electric field."" In 2005, other scientists then found the gene underlying this ion channel (name: TCP1). And now it has been Hedrich's team again that has identified that part of the channel which functions as a sensor for electric voltage and activates the channel. Their detailed findings are published in the journal Plant Biology. Having received attention from the scientific world, the article has been recommended by the ""Faculty of 1000"" in the meantime. The renowned platform, which evaluates scientific publications, is operated by worldwide leaders in biology and medicine. Teamwork discovered channel function The discovery of the voltage sensor was made by international teamwork. Initially, Hedrich got support from Professor Thomas M ller of his own department. The structural biologist created a three-dimensional model of the TPC1 channel protein. This allowed areas in the protein to be localised that are eligible as voltage sensors. ""Our model clearly showed that the TCP1 channel is made up of two interconnected, nearly identical protein units each capable of forming a potential voltage sensor,"" M ller explains. An analysis of the evolution of the TCP1 gene shed even more light on the matter. The W rzburg scientists J rg Schulz, Professor of Computation Biology, and Dirk Becker, a team leader at Julius von Sachs Plant Research Institute, found out that the gene first occurs with the evolution of cells that have a nucleus. Since then, all living beings, humans included, seem to have had it. ""During the analysis, we noticed that the second unit of the TPC1 protein has hardly changed in millions of years. It is almost identical from simple protozoa to plants and humans,"" Becker further. Mutations provided the decisive cue So they had to look for the voltage sensor in the second protein unit. The work group of W rzburg electrophysiologist Irene Marten then delivered the decisive experimental cue: Plants that carry a mutation in a special subunit of the channel have lost their ability to respond to the electric field. ""Together with the former W rzburg biophysicists Gerald Sch nknecht, presently researching at Oklahoma State University in the USA, and Ingo Dreyer, currently at University Talca in Chile, we then developed a mathematical model. This model can explain how the electric switch in the TPC1 channel protein works at the molecular level,"" Hedrich explains. What does the plant channel have to do with Ebola? What effects do mutations in the TPC1 channel have? According to the researchers' findings, they make the plant appear injured and change the perception of and defence against pathogens. Already in 2009, the W rzburg researchers showed that plants having a hyperactive form of the channel are in a constant state of alert and are hypersensitive to injury or attack by insects. ""Together with a Swiss work group, we are now investigating what interventions in the morbid channel can help heal the plant again,"" Hedrich says. ""Maybe this will give us new insight into the infection path of Ebola viruses."" This is because these pathogens use the human TPC1 channel to get access to the cells.","Published: July 11, 2016"

The grant, titled  Portable System for Detection of Harmful Algal Bloom Toxins in Freshwater and Marine Environments,  will help advance the development and commercialization of MBio s unique platform. MBio s Array System enables users in the field to perform laboratory-quality cyanotoxin testing to help protect drinking water, monitor commercial food resources, and provide critical data for ecosystems management. Harmful algal blooms in the United States and global freshwater and marine environments are increasing in frequency and duration. Algal blooms constitute a growing public health threat while also carrying substantial economic, ecologic, and food supply implications. A case in point is the devastating algae bloom currently affecting coastal Florida. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on June 29 in Martin and St. Lucie Counties following the presence of algal blooms in local waterways. The Executive Order will allow state and local governmental agencies to take swift action to mitigate the spread of algal blooms in the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries. In recent years, toxic algal blooms have shut down the water supply for the city of Toledo, and closed shellfish beds in the Pacific Northwest. Working with a network of domestic and international collaborators, MBio has demonstrated a unique, portable testing platform that delivers a panel of freshwater and marine toxin test results in a matter of minutes in an easy-to-use format. The platform utilizes MBio s proprietary LightDeck  technology, which enables simple, multiplex testing in a compact system. According to MBio Diagnostics CTO Michael Lochhead,  the MBio water toxin technology has been demonstrated by researchers through multiple validation studies now published in the scientific literature.

As part of that shift, TiGenix said, it was withdrawing its European marketing authorization application for ChondroCelect , an autologous cell therapy product for cartilage repair of the knee. Instead, TiGenix will refocus on its upcoming Phase III U.S. trial for Cx601, as well as its other clinical stage assets. Cx601 is a suspension of allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells (eASC) injected intralesionally. In March, TiGenix submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency for Cx601, based on positive 24-week results of the ADMIRE-CD Phase III clinical trial. More recently, TiGenix announced top-line 52-week data that it said confirmed the efficacy and safety of a single injection of Cx601. Following marketing authorization in Europe, Takeda will become the marketing authorization holder and will oversee all commercialization and regulatory activities. Takeda will also be responsible for additional development activities of Cx601 for the indication of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn s disease. TiGenix will retain the rights to develop Cx601 in new indications and will continue to hold U.S. rights to the allogenic stem cell therapy. ""This agreement further provides TiGenix with the financial strength to move forward with the clinical development of Cx601 in the U.S.,  TiGenix CEO Eduardo Bravo said in a statement, adding that the U.S. represents approximately half of the world s Crohn s market. Added Marc Princen, Takeda s president of Europe and Canada:  This collaboration and the addition of Cx601 to our portfolio highlights Takeda s commitment to the development of treatments to improve the health of people living with gastroenterological disorders, leveraging our expertise in inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn s specifically.  Takeda s therapeutic areas include gastrointestinal as well as  general medicine,  including oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic, central nervous system, respiratory and immunology, and vaccines. The licensing deal with TiGenix is Takeda s second gastrointestinal-focused initiative in less than a month. On June 8, Takeda inked a global license, development and commercialization agreement to develop Theravance Biopharma s TD-8954, a Phase II drug candidate for gastrointestinal motility disorders, including enteral feeding intolerance (EFI). The transaction could generate up to $125 million-plus for Theravance. In return for ex-U.S. rights to Cx601, Takeda agreed to pay TiGenix  25 million ($28 million) cash upfront, up to  355 million ($396 million) in payments tied to achieving regulatory and sales milestones, and double-digit royalties on net sales by Takeda. In addition, Takeda agreed to make an equity investment of  10 million ($11 million) in the share capital of TiGenix within the next 12 months. The first anticipated milestone payment TiGenix would receive is  15 million ($16.7 million) upon obtaining marketing authorization of Cx601 in the European Economic Area. TiGenix blamed  a difficult competitive landscape  due to a chilly regulatory environment in Europe for autologous chondrocyte-based cell therapy products, as well as a lack of reimbursement in key European countries, for its decision to withdraw its marketing application for ChondroCelect, which has been approved for reimbursement in The Netherlands and Spain. The company said it has agreed with Sobi to an early termination of their existing commercial relationship, which in 2014 entailed the licensing by TiGenix of exclusive marketing and distribution rights for ChondroCelect in Europe (excluding Finland), the Middle East, and North Africa to Sobi. TiGenix also said it will end a ChondroCelect-related manufacturing agreement with PharmaCell.","Published: July 11, 2016"

The deal gives BMS full rights to Cormorant s HuMax-IL8 antibody program and lead candidate HuMax-IL8, a Phase I/II monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8 (IL-8). By targeting IL-8, HuMax-IL8 offers the potential to enhance immune response and increase the efficacy of existing cancer medicines through combination therapy, BMS and Cormorant reason, adding that the antibody candidate can complement T-cell-directed antibodies and co-stimulatory molecules.  We believe combination therapy will be foundational to delivering the potential for long-term survival for patients, and the opportunity to develop the HuMax-IL8 antibody program together with our broad Immuno-oncology pipeline enables us to accelerate the next wave of potentially transformational immunotherapies,  Francis Cuss, MB BChir, FRCP, evp and CSO, BMS said in a statement. As of May 1, according to its website, BMS  immuno-oncology portfolio includes three marketed treatments Opdivo  (nivolumab), Empliciti  (elotuzumab) and Yervoy  (ipilimumab) and a pipeline anchored by the Phase III candidate Prostvac with five Phase I candidates. BMS  cancer holdings also include the marketed small-molecule drug Sprycel  (dasatinib) and five Phase I candidates.  Bristol-Myers Squibb s rich pipeline of clinical candidates and approved products provides even more opportunity for potential therapeutic synergy when coupled with HuMax-IL8,  added Cormorant CEO Maarten de Ch teau, M.D., Ph.D. Cormorant acquired exclusive worldwide rights to HuMax-IL8 from Genmab in 2012 in return for an upfront fee and future milestones and royalties, all undisclosed. Genmab in turn acquired the candidate 5 years earlier from Medarex, which BMS acquired in 2009 for $2.4 billion. On its LinkedIn page, Cormorant stated that HuMax-IL8 is envisioned as a treatment for several forms of cancer since IL-8 is a protein expressed by many solid tumours:  IL-8 inhibition also has the potential to reduce tumour immunosuppression through MDSCs (myeloid-`derived suppressor cells).  Under the transaction, BMS agreed to pay upfront and near-term milestone payments of up to $95 million, as well as $425 million in additional payments tied to achieving development and regulatory milestones.

The start-up company has spun-out of Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (NNUH), where the technology originated, with support from Health Enterprise East (HEE), a leading NHS Innovation Hub. Investment comes from Anglia Capital Group, New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership and the Low Carbon Innovation Fund, totalling  500K and will be used to fund further technology development towards CE-marking and human study trials at the NNUH.  Tissue ablation is a surgical procedure used to destroy tissue, such as a tumour, in situ. A needle-like probe is placed inside the tumour; radiofrequency waves passing through the probe increase the temperature within the tissue and results in tumour destruction. However current application of the procedure is limited in terms of the size and location of tumours which can be treated.  Ablatus Therapeutics is leveraging a novel technology called Bimodal Electric Tissue Ablation (BETA) which offers the potential to address some of the problems of the most commonly-used ablation system. The technology utilises a combination of AC and DC power which prevents tissue damage created by charring and thereby increases the size of the zone which can be treated compared to other technologies. The new company benefits from granted patents, peer-reviewed publications and an experienced management team. David Brooks, Chief Executive at Ablatus Therapeutics, has wide-ranging experience in drug, device and diagnostic development with a focus on leveraging value from early-stage technologies. He was previously responsible for clinical and business development at TwistDx, the leading DNA diagnostics company and subsidiary of Alere Inc.  David Brooks, Chief Executive at Ablatus Therapeutics, commented:  BETA has the potential to treat tumours previously considered too large for ablation therapy. Ablatus Therapeutics will be using the investment from this ACG-led round to progress the development of BETA towards the market, ultimately with a view to improving patient outcomes."" Dr Anne Blackwood, CEO at HEE, said:  We are delighted to have been involved in the early stage funding and commercialisation of such an exciting technology especially as it shows every potential to revolutionise how certain cancers are treated. HEE is looking forward to continuing its support as Ablatus Therapeutics develops as a company and brings BETA closer to helping patients.  Professor Marcus Flather, Director of Research and Development at the NNUH added:  This new technology has been created and developed through lab-based studies, by innovative NNUH staff. The funding offers the opportunity to further develop the technology, making sure it is both safe and effective in treating certain cancers and ultimately improving outcomes for patients.  Struan McDougall, CEO of Anglia Capital Group, said:  Anglia Capital Group is delighted to have had the opportunity to work with HEE on the first spinout from the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.

The project is funded by an award granted to Swansea s Reconstructive Surgery and Regenerative Medicine (ReconRegen) Research Group by the United Kingdom s Medical Research Council. This multi-disciplinary technology development collaboration includes plastic surgeons, engineers, scientists, and the nanocellulose manufacturer, American Process Inc. Swansea s ReconRegen group has previously shown that nanocellulose is compatible with human cells and can be printed as a support tissue structure. The group has also shown that living cells can survive the 3D printing process. Under this JDA, cells will be blended with various formulations of nanocellulose scaffold material and 3D-printed into tissues for reconstructive surgery. The goal of the project is to produce anatomically-shaped tissues tailored for individual patients that are durable enough to survive indefinitely and able to withstand degradation, long term. This would be the first step towards personalised reconstruction. According to project leader Professor Iain Whitaker,  3D printing is increasingly used to manufacture prosthetics and implants from materials like plastic or titanium. But bio-printing   using human cells instead of man-made material   is a promising new science. We are printing living tissues, living structures, tailored to the needs of individual patients. We hope that in the future, patients who have lost all or part of their ear or nose through trauma or cancer could have reconstruction using new tissue which is grown from their own cells using nanocellulose. Biomaterials are a key component of our tissue printing technology and nanocellulose is our biomaterial of choice because of its biocompatibility, mechanical and structural properties that can support cell attachment and growth in three-dimensions.  As a novel biomaterial, nanocellulose has various characteristics that make it a preferred component for  bioinks . Its high water holding capacity and unique particle assembly in water causes nanocellulose to form shear-thinning gels that flow easily during printing but becomes firm gel-like three-dimensional structures when deposited on a surface. In addition, nanocellulose self-assembles to form dense, smooth, and strong structures after drying. Research has also shown nanocellulose to be non-cytotoxic to growing cells. According to Zita Jessop, an MRC Clinical Research Fellow,  We chose to partner with API because of their unique nanocellulose process that produces a variety of nanocellulose products with various particle sizes and surface chemistry and because of their ability to provide large quantities needed for our technology development efforts. We also depend on their expertise in handling and processing this unique material in our application.  Dr Ayesha Al-Sabah, a ReconRegen Postdoctoral Fellow, reported that  on trialing the nanocellulose bioink it became clear that the rheological properties were ideally suited to nozzle-based 3D bioprinting . According to Theodora Retsina, CEO of API,  Nanocellulose has a variety of advantages that we expect to significantly impact the growing biomedical engineering field. Tissue engineering alone will have significant impact on the global economy. According to a recent market report, the global market will increase from US$23 billion currently to over US$94 billion by 2022. We are thrilled to collaborate with the innovators at Swansea who are contributing to this global growth. We built our BioPlus  nanocellulose demonstration plant to support efforts such as this to develop break-through technologies that will provide solutions for a more healthful, prosperous future for global citizens.  The BioPlus nanocellulose technology is currently being demonstrated at API s Thomaston Biorefinery in Thomaston, Georgia which is also the site of the company s research and development laboratory. API has positioned itself as a leader in the nanocellulose intellectual property (IP) landscape with over 100 patents pending in the field and four granted in the US. Under the terms of the Joint Development Agreement, it is anticipated that third-parties interested in commercializing technologies developed during the project in the fields of 3D bioprinting, plastic surgery, and tissue reconstruction with nanocellulose will license IP from both API and Swansea University.","Published: July 9, 2016"

See Also: Altered cell cycle gene activity underlies brain overgrowth in toddlers with autism Intriguingly, the Salk team found that stem cell-derived neurons made fewer connections in the dish compared to cells from healthy individuals. Furthermore, the scientists were able to restore communication between the cells by adding IGF-1, a drug currently being evaluated in clinical trials of autism. ""This technology allows us to generate views of neuron development that have historically been intractable,"" says senior investigator Rusty Gage, a professor in Salk's Laboratory of Genetics and holder of the Vi and John Adler Chair for Research on Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases. ""We're excited by the possibility of using stem cell methods to unravel the biology of autism and to possibly screen for new drug treatments for this debilitating disorder."" Autism, which affects approximately 1 out of every 68 children in the United States, is characterized by problems communicating, difficulties interacting with others, and in repetitive behaviors, although the symptoms range dramatically in type and severity. There is no known cause of autism. In 2010, Gage, Carol Marchetto of Salk's Laboratory of Genetics, Alysson Muotri of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and their collaborators showed they could recreate features of Rett syndrome a rare disorder that shares features of autism but is caused by mutations in a single gene in a petri dish. Learn More: Brains with autism adapt differently during implicit learning They did so by taking skin cells from patients, adding a mix of chemicals that instructed those cells to form stem cells, and in turn, coaxing their new stem cells into neurons. The ability to form what's called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human cells was pioneered by researchers in 2007, but some scientists were initially skeptical that the new technology could lend insight into complex heritable disorders such as autism. ""In that study, induced pluripotent stem cells gave us a window into the birth of a neuron that we would not otherwise have,"" says Marchetto, a senior staff scientist and the study's first author. ""Seeing features of Rett syndrome in a dish gave us the confidence to next study classical autism."" Neurons derived from people with autism spectrum disorder, shown in the bottom panel, form fewer inhibitory connections, shown in the red stain, compared to those derived from healthy individuals (top panel). The total number of neurons that researchers were able to generate was about the same between the two groups. Credit: Salk Institute  In the new study, collaborating with Muotri and other scientists at UCSD once more, Gage's team created stem cells from a subset of people with autism whose brains had grown up to 23 percent faster than usual during toddlerhood but had subsequently normalized. The neuron precursor cells derived from the patients multiplied faster than those of typically developing individuals. The finding supports a theory some experts have put forth that brain enlargement is caused by disruptions to the cell's normal cycle of division, Marchetto says. In addition, the stem cell-derived neurons of individuals with autism behaved abnormally, bursting with activity less often compared with those cells of healthy people. Don't Miss: Limited motor skills in early infancy may be trait of autism Those neurons' activity seemed to improve by adding IGF-1, which is known to enhance the connections between neurons. The group plans to use the patient cells to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind IGF-1's effects, in particular probing for changes in gene expression with treatment. Although the newly derived cells are far from patients' brains, a brain cell by itself may reveal important clues about a person, Marchetto says. ""It never fails to amaze me when we can see similarities between the characteristics of the cells in the dish and the human disease,"" she adds.

The mice, which can be tuned to have different levels of sensitivity to any smell by using mouse or human odor receptors, could be used as land-mine detectors or as the basis for novel disease sensors. The technology, a transgenic approach to engineering the mouse genome, could also provide researchers with a way to study human odor receptors. ""This is one of our five basic senses, yet we have almost no clue how odors are coded by the brain,"" says lead investigator Paul Feinstein, an associate professor of biological sciences at Hunter. ""It's still a black box."" See Also: Decoding characteristic food odors The nature of the odor receptors was discovered in 1991, a Nobel Prize winning feat, but exactly how the olfactory system wires itself still isn't well understood. The noses of mammals contain a collection of sensory neurons, each equipped with a single chemical sensor called a receptor that detects a specific odor. In mice, as in humans, each neuron selects only one receptor. Collectively, neurons choose an even distribution of receptors, so each of the thousand distinct receptors is represented in about 0.1 percent of neurons. In an effort to understand the mechanism these neurons use to choose a specific receptor, Feinstein tinkered with the mouse genome. He introduced the DNA for an odor receptor gene transgenically, by injection into the nucleus of a fertilized egg cell. He also added an extra string of DNA to the gene sequence to see if it would alter the probability of the gene being chosen. After a few attempts, he found a string that, when copied four or more times, worked. More copies of this extra string of DNA resulted in a series of super-sniffer mice with increasing numbers of neurons expressing the selected receptor, a well-characterized receptor that detects acetophenone, which has a sweet smell similar to jasmine. The mice still maintain a relatively even distribution of other odor receptors. ""We don't know how the neuron performs singular gene choice yet, but we can increase the probability of a given choice occurring,"" says Feinstein. This visual abstract summarizes MouSensors. D'Hulst et al. have increased the total number of neurons expressing specific mouse or human odorant receptors (ORs) in the nose of a mouse by genetically controlling OR gene choice. These MouSensors show lower specific odor detection thresholds and provide a platform to study OR gene expression and odor coding in vivo. Credit: D'Hulst et al./Cell Reports 2016  In parallel, post-doctoral researcher Charlotte D'Hulst was trying to replace a mouse receptor gene with a human one. Even though such gene swapping is standard practice in other fields, it did not work. It wasn't the first time researchers had been stymied by olfaction. Repeated attempts in the field to study odor receptors by growing them in cells in Petri dishes have also led to dead ends. As a result, human olfaction receptors are poorly understood. ""Without understanding how odors bind to receptors, people have no rational way of designing new odors,"" says D'Hulst. ""They also have no way of boosting the diminished smell capacity in patients with diseases such as Parkinson's."" So D'Hulst abandoned gene swapping and tried Feinstein's transgenic super-sniffer technique to insert a human receptor gene into the mouse. It worked. ""We have developed a system where we can study human odor receptors and finally determine how human odor coding works,"" says Feinstein. The team validated that the mice do indeed have an amplified sense of smell for the given receptor. They first used fluorescent imaging in live mice to trace the activation of the amplified odor receptor in response to the receptor's corresponding odor. These tests gave visual confirmation that the receptors are functional and present in greater numbers than others. In a standard behavioral test in which animals were trained to avoid an odor known to bind the transgenic receptor, the super-sniffer mice were able to detect the presence of this unpleasant odor in water at levels two orders of magnitude lower than those detectable by mice without super-sniffer abilities. ""The animals could smell the odor better because of the increased presence of the receptor,"" says D'Hulst. Learn More: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells The team is now working towards commercializing their technology and has founded a company called MouSensor, LLC. The Feinstein lab has received funding from the Department of Defense to develop super-sniffing rats that can be trained to detect TNT and potentially find land mines. The researchers also envision applications of the MouSensor for developing a type of nose-on-a-chip as a means of diagnosing disease using chemical detection profiling. ""We have these millions-of-years-old receptors that are highly tuned to detect chemicals,"" says Feinstein. ""We think we can develop them into tools and use them to detect disease.""

Researchers also assessed 18 carefully matched athletes who had not experienced a concussion. At all time points, all participants had advanced brain scans consisting of diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion kurtosis tensor imaging to look for acute and chronic changes to the brain's white matter. The scans are based on the movement of water molecules in brain tissue and measure microstructural changes in white matter, which connects different brain regions. Those who had concussions had less water movement, or diffusion, in the acute stages following concussion (24 hours, six days) compared to those who did not have concussions. These microstructural changes still persisted six months after the injury. Also, those who had more severe symptoms at the time of the concussion were more likely to have alterations in the brain's white matter six months later.

The research, published in Cell Reports, adds to our knowledge of how this aggressive type of cancer advances and will help identify future therapies.  One form of leukaemia is caused by a type of DNA damage called  chromosomal translocation . This is where parts of two different chromosomes fuse together. The resultant fusion gene   in this instance MLL-AF4   acts in a very different way from when the two genes are separate.  The expression of the MLL4-AF4 fusion gene can occur at very early stages of the embryo s development while in the womb and can result in infants being born with a very aggressive form of leukaemia. The earlier the onset of this form of blood cancer, the worse the prognosis.  Survival rates for the most common form of childhood leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have improved dramatically, with around nine in 10 children surviving for longer than five years. Infant ALL, which develops when the child is under 12 months of age, accounts for less than five percent of cases of childhood ALL and is a biologically distinct cancer   often involving just a few genetic faults. It has a much poorer outlook, with only around half of patients surviving for longer than five years. A MLL gene fault is involved in 80% of cases of infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.  Because this cancer begins to develop  in utero  and prior studies have studied the effect of MLL-AF4 in blood cells of adult mice only, the key question of how MLL-AF4 might affect an unborn baby s unique blood cells remained unanswered. This is the first study to investigate how MLL-AF4 affects developing blood forming cells in mouse embryos in a bid to understand how this aggressive leukaemia emerges. To investigate the disease process, scientists bred mice where one parent carries an inactive form of the fusion gene and the other parent expresses a gene for an enzyme that activates the fusion gene. The embryos from this pairing were found to have a development window where a pre-leukaemic state took hold with increased production of pro-B cells   precursor to a type of white blood cell. Lead researcher, Dr Katrin Ottersbach, said of the results:  One of the most common and aggressive types of infant blood cancer is associated with the MLL-AF4 fusion gene, which arises during pregnancy. One of the main impediments to improving the survival rates in infants is the lack of knowledge on where and when during development this mutation arises and how it affects the developing blood system of the baby.   Our findings reveal the first changes that take place in blood development caused by the MLL-AF4 mutation during a pre-cancerous state. This has increased our knowledge on how this aggressive disease develops and will help identify early signs of disease and points for therapeutic intervention.  Dr Alasdair Rankin, Director of Research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise, which funded the study along with the MRC and the Wellcome Trust, said  Long term survival rates for childhood leukaemia have improved significantly overall, but the outlook for infants who develop leukaemia soon after birth remains comparatively poor. The intensive chemotherapy used can itself be fatal for babies and many survivors will develop health problems in later life. This more detailed understanding of how a key genetic fault drives the majority of infant leukaemia cases could lead to more effective and kinder treatments in the future.

Antibiotics have saved millions of lives and created a world in which complex and lifesaving surgeries are possible. But the overuse of antibiotics threatens to create a global scourge of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. Because of this problem, public health experts regularly remind physicians to prescribe antibiotics only for bacterial infections. But, too often there s no easy way for doctors to tell whether a patient s illness is bacterial or viral or, sometimes, whether there s even any infection at all.  A lot of times you can t really tell what kind of infection someone has,  said Timothy Sweeney, MD, PhD an engineering research associate with the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection and lead author of the paper.  If someone comes into the clinic, a bacterial or a viral infection often look exactly the same.   The idea to look for a diagnostic test came from our previous paper in Immunity last year,  said assistant professor of medicine Purvesh Khatri, PhD, the senior author.  In that paper, we found a common response by the human immune system to multiple viruses that is distinct from that for bacterial infections. We wondered whether we could exploit that difference to improve the diagnosis of bacterial or viral infections. But we needed a gene signature consisting of far fewer genes for the test to be clinically useful.  Blood test The team used publicly available patient gene expression data to pinpoint just seven human genes whose activity changes during an infection; their pattern of activity can distinguish whether an infection is bacterial or viral. When pathogens infect the cells of the body, the infection sets off a chain reaction involving the immune system that changes the activity, or expression, of hundreds of genes. Gene expression is the process by which cells extract information from genes and render it in the form of either proteins or RNA. Cells have the capacity to express more or less of each molecule, creating a pattern of gene expression that can change in response to external influences, including infections. The seven-gene test is a vast improvement over earlier tests that look at the activity of hundreds of genes, the researchers said. Because so few genes are involved, the new test will be cheaper and faster, while remaining accurate, they said. A study in Nepal co-authored by assistant professor of medicine Jason Andrews, MD, revealed that only 5 percent of patients who received antibiotics actually needed them, said Khatri. The Nepalese patients got antibiotic treatment because the drug was cheaper than trying to figure out if they actually needed it.  If we really want to make a difference,  Khatri said,  our test has to be more cost-effective than the drug itself.  That s an important breakpoint, he said, since it could allow health-care systems to use antibiotics appropriately and save money at the same time. The work is part of a global response to the need to reduce the use of antibiotics, driven in part by President Obama s National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. Today, drug-resistant bacteria cause 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths each year in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, of the 154 million antibiotic prescriptions written in U.S. doctors  offices and emergency departments each year, it s estimated that 1 in 3 are unnecessary. A 2014 review of antimicrobial resistance reported that unless something is done to stop the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such so-called superbugs could cost the world $100 trillion in gross-domestic-product losses by 2050. Finally, besides promoting the evolution of drug-resistant microbes, antibiotics increase the risk of side effects such as tendon rupture or kidney damage, and can damage gut and other microbiomes that are essential to overall health. Hurdles ahead The new gene-expression test for bacterial infection faces two hurdles before it can be made available to doctors in a few years. First, it must be thoroughly tested in a clinical setting. Until now, the data and test results for this ongoing work have all come from pre-existing, online digital data sets of gene expression from patients with different kinds of infections   not from current patients. The new study tested the seven-gene test on blood samples from 96 critically ill children, using an assay called NanoString, and found that the test was accurate. But it needs to be further validated in larger numbers of patient blood samples, the researchers said. Second, the test needs to be incorporated into a device that can give a result in an hour or less. The preliminary NanoString version of the blood test takes four to six hours   too long for people who are seriously ill. In patients who have sepsis, for example, the risk of death goes up by 6 to 8 percent for every hour that antibiotics are delayed, so it s critically important to act quickly. For that reason, Sweeney and Khatri are working with other researchers on a way to engineer the gene expression test to provide results in under an hour. The plan is to combine an 11-gene test they created a few months ago with the more recent seven-gene test. The 11-gene test reveals if the patient has an infection at all. If they do have an infection, the seven-gene test reveals if it is bacterial or viral. Both tests would be run at the same time. The researchers envision the two tests as a decision tree.  When you put the new seven-gene set together with the 11-gene set, we can make a decision tree that matches how a physician might think about a patient,  said Sweeney.  First we ask,  Is an infection present?  Because some people present with an inflammation, a fever, a high heart rate, but it s not due to an infection. Then we ask,  If so, what kind?  The 18-gene combination test would first be used in hospitals, Sweeney said. It s possible, he said, that an even cheaper test just using the seven genes could be used in outpatient clinics. The work is an example of Stanford Medicine s focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.","Published: July 8, 2016"

In the study published in Nature Medicine, researchers worked with a species of Old World monkeys, rhesus macaques to reproduce the trial results of RV144, the only HIV vaccine that has been tested and shown to reduce the rate of HIV acquisition in a phase III clinical trial. Researchers were interested in not only recapitulating the findings from the RV144 trial, but also determining if replacing the alum adjuvant   a substance commonly found in non-living vaccines known to induce antibody-mediated immunity   with a different adjuvant, MF59 would decrease simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) acquisition at an increased rate and yield a more efficacious vaccine. Although MF59 is known to help stimulate the human body's immune response, the idea that it could lead to greater vaccine efficacy is a popular working theory shared by scientists worldwide. Rafick-Pierre Se kaly, PhD, the Richard J. Fasenmyer Professor of Immunopathogensis, is a pioneering AIDS researcher, co-director of the CFAR Proteomics and Systems Biology Core, a professor of pathology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. He helped to lead this study which simulated potential HIV infection by rectally challenging the macaques with SIV, the primate form of HIV. Simulation in macaques has been a critical step in progressing HIV research, since the virus does not replicate well in most other model organisms.  With this simulation complete, researchers were able to successfully reproduce the RV144 trial results in macaques, ultimately finding that the RV144 vaccine combined with the alum adjuvant reduced the risk of acquisition by 44 percent, which is within the range of the 31 percent efficacy previously measured in humans.  However, researchers were surprised to learn that changing the adjuvant to MF59 did not result in a significantly better vaccine, but instead rendered the altered vaccine unable to prevent SIV acquisition at a greater rate and triggered an adaptive immune response only at the site of infection, thereby disproving the commonly believed hypothesis. Importantly, researchers were able to uncover more about the alum group s mode of action in the RV144 vaccine which, to-date, is not fully understood. Researchers discovered a unique association between an intercellular pathway known as Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (RAS) and the efficacy of RV144. Ten of twelve genes associated with the RAS pathway were expresses within the vaccine and have been shown to trigger several subsets of innate and adaptive responses that, in turn, are associated with a decreased risk of SIV acquisition in the alum-vaccine group. Whether RAS activation is an important hallmark of HIV-vaccine efficacy in humans is an area for further study. According to Dr. Sekaly,  These fascinating clinical results effectively dispel our previous belief that the RV144 vaccine could possibly become more effective with the MF59 adjuvant. Instead, we found that the modified vaccine actually triggered the recruitment of innate cells in the site of infection. Through this research, we were able to confirm the efficacy of the current RV144 vaccine in preventing infection by HIV/SIV in macaques, creating an even clearer pathway to the near-term development of this vaccine for human use.  Based on the pre-vaccination RNA expression of the macaque, Dr. Sekaly and his team were also able to accurately predict whether or not the animal was going to respond to the RV144 vaccine in alum, correctly forecasting the response in two thirds of the macaques tested. These findings have tremendous implications for the use of personalized medicine in vaccinology, an exciting exploration of genomics that is already underway in the scientific community.  We have seen that pre-selecting subjects that will benefit from a therapy based on their predicted response or risk of disease is an excellent way to improve potential outcomes,  said Dr. Sekaly.  These study results strongly support the notion that personalized and predictive vaccinology will soon become a reality, including in HIV a disease area for which this type of precision medicine is desperately needed but has not yet been extensively studied.

Using next generation sequencing they have now developed a rapid test which provides a result within 2-3 days - previous techniques took months. Mitochondrial diseases affect the batteries of the cell and can lead to muscular weakness, blindness, fatal heart failure, learning disability, liver failure, diabetes and can lead to death in early infancy. Publishing in the American Journal of Human Genetics, first author and PhD student Charlotte Alston who is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), describes the technique which has already identified six patients from four families affected by this form of mitochondrial disease. She said:  Identifying a fault in Complex I, one of the building blocks of mitochondria which is responsible for causing disease combined with our custom gene capture and the latest sequencing technology means we can screen many more genes to diagnose this debilitating disease.  It means families can get a rapid diagnosis within days rather than the weeks and months that testing can currently take. For families who are waiting on a genetic diagnosis before trying for another baby, or they may already be expecting their next child, time really is of the essence.  Diagnosing mitochondrial disease Mitochondrial diseases are genetic conditions affecting the batteries of the cell, with around one in 4,300 affected children born every year. Symptoms include muscle weakness, blindness, deafness, seizures, learning disabilities, diabetes, heart and liver failure. There is no cure and affected children often sadly die in early infancy. The research has confirmed the identity of a mutation causing mitochondrial disease affecting Complex I, one of five complexes involved in energy production. The gene, TMEM126B, makes a protein necessary for assembly of the complex, with defects causing problems with energy generation in patient s muscles. Finding a genetic cause is important to families as it means that they can find out what is wrong with their child enabling doctors and scientists to help them understand the risks to their future children and help prevent them losing another child. Professor Rob Taylor from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, who also leads the NHS Highly Specialised Mitochondrial Diagnostic Laboratory at the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust says:  The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is often a complicated and time consuming process. There are over 1,300 potential genes that can lead to disease and, as such, finding the genetic cause is sometimes like looking for a needle in a haystack.  NHS test for affected families Defective genes can be caused by mutations in either the maternally-inherited mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) or more frequently, the genes located on the autosomes, the 23 pairs of chromosomes which are responsible for all traits and all other genetic diseases. For a family with one child affected with this type of mitochondrial disease, there is a 25% chance of each further child being affected with the devastating condition. Professor Taylor adds:  There is sadly no cure for mitochondrial disease so rapid diagnosis means parents who are wanting to have further children can opt for prenatal testing to ensure future children are healthy and without risk of developing severe disease. It provides options for families at risk of an otherwise incurable disease.  Highly-specialised mitochondrial services are NHS funded and streamlined across the country so this genetic test is now available within routine practice to patients nationally. This research was funded through a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) doctoral fellowship and made possible through the Newcastle Academic Health Partners, a collaboration involving Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle University.

The PMI Cohort Program is a landmark longitudinal research effort that aims to engage 1 million or more U.S. participants to improve our ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetics. The awards will support a Data and Research Support Center, Participant Technologies Center and a network of Healthcare Provider Organizations (HPO). An award to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, to build the biobank, another essential component, was announced earlier this year. All awards are for five years, pending progress reviews and availability of funds. With these awards, NIH is on course to begin initial enrollment into the PMI Cohort Program in 2016, with the aim of meeting its enrollment goal by 2020.  The more we understand about individual differences, the better able we will be to effectively prevent and treat illness    Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Director, NIH The PMI Cohort Program is one of the most ambitious research projects in history and will set the foundation for new ways of engaging people in research. PMI volunteers will be asked to contribute a wide range of health, environment and lifestyle information. They will also be invited to answer questions about their health history and status, share their genomic and other biological information through simple blood and urine tests and grant access to their clinical data from electronic health records. In addition, mobile health devices and apps will provide lifestyle data and environmental exposures in real time.  All of this will be accomplished with essential privacy and security safeguards.  As partners in the research, participants will have ongoing input into study design and implementation, as well as access to a wide range of their individual and aggregated study results.  This range of information at the scale of 1 million people from all walks of life will be an unprecedented resource for researchers working to understand all of the factors that influence health and disease,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  Over time, data provided by participants will help us answer important health questions, such as why some people with elevated genetic and environmental risk factors for disease still manage to maintain good health, and how people suffering from a chronic illness can maintain the highest possible quality of life. The more we understand about individual differences, the better able we will be to effectively prevent and treat illness.  The knowledge gained from the PMI Cohort Program will extend successes of precision medicine in some cancers to many other diseases.  Importantly, the program will focus not just on disease, but also on ways to increase an individual s chances of remaining healthy throughout life.   As someone who has personally benefited from precision medicine, I am excited for this study to intersect with other fundamental changes in medicine and research to empower people to live healthier lives,  added PMI Cohort Program Director Eric Dishman.  What potential participants need to know is that we are equally interested in learning how we can prevent illness in the first place, but when we do get ill, which treatment options are going to work best for each of us individually.  These initial awards bring together the major elements through a variety of new partnerships that are needed to launch the PMI Cohort Program later this year.  This is an incredibly complex study requiring new kinds of strategic and operational partnerships   this can t be business as usual,  said Kathy L. Hudson, Ph.D., NIH Deputy Director for Science, Outreach, and Policy who helped orchestrate the PMI Cohort Program.  We are excited to break new ground in engaging people in research and building a study of this scale and scope.  The infrastructure will be assembled with the following organizations and is intended to expand over time as needed to support the growth of the cohort: Data and Research Support Center The Data and Research Support Center has been awarded to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, working with the Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences), Mountain View, California. This center will acquire, organize and provide secure access to what will be one of the world s largest and most diverse datasets for precision medicine research. They will also provide research support for the scientific data and analysis tools for the program, helping to build a vibrant community of researchers from community colleges to top healthcare research institutions and industries, and including citizen scientists, who can propose studies using this information. Participant Technologies Center Enrollment of PMI Cohort Program participants will be through two distinct approaches. One leverages the strengths of HPOs that have existing relationships with potential participants, and the other will be through the Participant Technologies Center, which will support direct enrollment. The Participant Technologies Center has been awarded to the Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, and Vibrent Health, Fairfax, Virginia. The center will also develop, test, maintain and upgrade, as needed, PMI Cohort Program mobile applications. These mobile apps will be used to enroll, consent, collect data from and communicate with PMI Cohort Program participants. Importantly, the center will need to develop parallel platforms to deliver these same functions to those without smartphones, and work with various technology organizations to increase smartphone accessibility. Healthcare Provider Organizations NIH will build a network of HPOs over time to ensure that participants in the research represent the geographic, ethnic, racial and socioeconomic diversity of the country.  The network will include regional and national medical centers, community health centers and medical centers operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The following organizations have been selected as the initial set of HPOs with another funding opportunity in the coming months. These HPOs will engage their patients in the PMI Cohort Program, help build the research protocols and plans, enroll interested individuals and collect essential health data and biological specimens.  The regional medical centers are:   Columbia University Health Sciences, New York City   Northwestern University, Chicago   University of Arizona, Tucson   University of Pittsburgh at Pittsburgh These awardees have sub-awards with organizations that extend the geographic reach of the HPO network. In addition, NIH collaborated with the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) to select six Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which are community-based HPOs that reach underserved areas and populations. This award supports a pilot program to determine infrastructure needs that will enable a wide variety of FQHCs to participate as HPOs. FQHCs will be critical for bringing underserved individuals, families and communities into the cohort, especially those historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Recipients are:   Cherokee Health Systems, Knoxville, Tennessee   Community Health Center, Inc., Middletown, Connecticut   Eau Claire Cooperative Health Center, Columbia, South Carolina   HRHCare, Peekskill, New York   Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, Jackson, Mississippi   San Ysidro Health Center, San Ysidro, California Another significant and important partner in the HPO network is the VA, which has medical centers across the United States that provide care to America s veterans. By collaborating with the VA, the NIH will ensure America s former servicemen and women have the opportunity to participate in the PMI Cohort Program. The VA Healthcare System serves a demographically and geographically diverse population, which strengthens NIH s capacity to enroll people of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds in the cohort. The VA will leverage the experience and infrastructure gained from its Million Veteran Program (link is external), which partners with U.S. veterans receiving care at VA medical centers to study how genes affect health, to help enroll veterans in the PMI Cohort Program. Biobank In May of 2016, Mayo Clinic was awarded the task of building the PMI Cohort Program Biobank. The biobank will support the collection, analyses, storage and distribution for research use of biological samples known as biospecimens. Data from laboratory analyses of biospecimens will be combined with an array of other lifestyle and health information provided by volunteers to help researchers continue to unravel individual differences that contribute to disease and response to treatments.","Published: July 8, 2016"

They observed that a range of low-intensity, middle-frequency electric fields effectively stopped breast and lung cancer cells from growing and spreading, while having no adverse effect on neighboring healthy cells. The device, about the size of a U.S. dollar coin, is designed to help scientists narrow in on safe ranges of electric fields to noninvasively treat breast, lung, and other forms of cancer. The results are published online in Scientific Reports. The paper s co-authors include Roger Kamm, the Cecil and Ida Green Distinguished Professor of Mechanical and Biological Engineering at MIT, as well as research scientists Andrea Pavesi and Giulia Adriani, postdoc Majid Ebrahimi Warkiani, and student Andy Tay of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). Senior research officer Wei Hseun Yeap and associate professor Siew Cheng Wong of the Singapore Immunology Network also contributed to the report.  We hope this device will increase interest by researchers who are exploring the effect of electric fields on different types of cancer,  Adriani says.  In our study, we noticed the effect was limited to the cancer cell at the tested frequencies and intensities, but we really need to explore other cells and parameters.  An electric recipe For the past decade, scientists have been experimenting with the use of electric fields to treat malignant cells, in an alternative cancer treatment called tumor treating field, or TTF. The therapy stems from the interaction between key cellular structures in tumors, and an external electric field. In general, an electric field is a field of forces that act on objects that have an electric charge. An electric field can also influence the alignment of polar molecules in tumor cells, such as microtubules. Normally, these molecules are crucial for cell division, which, when it goes into overdrive, leads to tumor growth. When microtubules line up end to end to form a mitotic spindle, the cell s genetic material attaches to the spindle fibers, pulling and splitting the cell into two cells. In the past, scientists have observed that these charged molecules respond to a low-frequency electric field, between 100 and 300 kilohertz and with an intensity as strong as the field strength of a mixer or toaster. Instead of forming mitotic spindles, the microtubule alignment is disrupted in such a way that it prevents cell division and tumor growth.  Scientists have been trying to figure out a lot of different recipes to try to stimulate the cell with an electric field,  Pavesi says.  By tweaking the intensity and frequency, you can have an effect only on the cancer cells, leaving the other type of cells unaltered, without destroying them. That s the key concept.  A company, Novocure, has since been founded to develop TTF therapies for people with brain and lung cancer. Pavesi, who has been helping to design microfluidic devices with Kamm, came up with the idea for a device to test TTF after watching a TED talk by Novocure s founder.  Immediately, I was thinking to myself,  This is an easy thing I can replicate in one of my devices,  Pavesi recalls. Gaining time The researchers fabricated the device from PDMS, a widely used, gel-like polymer, and patterned small channels across the device. They then developed a conductive mixture made from micron-sized silver flakes and PDMS, which they cured, then injected into two channels in the device to form two tiny, separate electrodes. In the region between the electrodes, they injected hydrogels with breast or lung cancer cells as well as small tumor masses. The researchers also injected healthy human endothelial cells. The hydrogels created a three-dimensional matrix to mimic the extracellular environment. The team subjected each cell type in the 3-D matrix to alternating electric fields at frequencies of 150 or 200 kilohertz, continuously, at an intensity of 1.1 volts per centimeter. In the absence of an electric field, Pavesi says the cancer cells begin to proliferate and spread within two days. However, he and Adriani observed a significant slowdown in tumor progression after three days of continuous electric field stimulation: Proliferation was markedly reduced, while small masses of lung cancer cells did not disperse indicating an inhibition of their metastatic potential. What s more, healthy endothelial cells in the same device were left unaffected. The researchers hypothesize that healthy cells may require different frequencies to be influenced by an electric field, as their size and electrical properties are far different from that of cancer cells. Adriani hopes the microfluidic device can help scientists test a wide range of electric field intensities and frequencies on other cancer cell types. While TTF therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating brain tumors, that approval process took years to test electric fields, first in vitro, then in animals and in humans. Pavesi says a microfluidic device could speed up that process.  Maybe by screening TTF to optimize frequency and intensity, you can at least reduce the time it takes for in vivo studies,  Pavesi says.  There may be thousands of variables, but you could first try them in this device. If you find 10 that work, you can go ahead and try those 10 in the animal model.  Ultimately, the device may be used to identify the most effective electric field to treat cancer cells taken directly from a patient, says Chwee Teck Lim, a professor of biomedical engineering at the National University of Singapore, who did not participate in the study.  One step forward that the group can take is to start testing on cancer patient-derived cells either obtained from tumor or liquid biopsy, such as circulating tumor cells, and to see if there are particular types of cancer cells that will succumb to or be more resistant to such TTF treatment,  Lim says.  For personalized medicine, you can test if a recipe works for a specific person,  Adriani says.  In three days, you can have an answer. And for many cancer patients who are dying of metastasis, time is everything.  This research was supported, in part, by the National Research Foundation of Singapore through the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology BioSystems and Micromechanics interdisciplinary research group.","Published: July 8, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/organ-behaviour-manipulation-possible-with-new-injectable-204502,Organ Behaviour Manipulation Possible with New Injectable Scientists develop injectable that could be used to stimulate nerve cells and manipulate muscle and organ behaviour  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.In the campy 1966 science fiction movie  Fantastic Voyage,  scientists miniaturize a submarine with them inside and travel through the body of a colleague to break up a potentially fatal blood clot. Micro-humans aside, imagine the inflammation that metal sub would cause. Ideally, injectable or implantable medical devices should not only be small and electrically functional, they should be soft, like the body tissues with which they interact. Scientists from two UChicago labs set out to see if they could design a material with all three of those properties. The material they came up with, the subject of a study published June 27 in Nature Materials, forms the basis of an ingenious light-activated injectable device that could eventually be used to stimulate nerve cells and manipulate the behaviour of muscles and organs.  Most traditional materials for implants are very rigid and bulky, especially if you want to do electrical stimulation,  said Bozhi Tian, an assistant professor in chemistry whose lab collaborated with that of neuroscientist Francisco Bezanilla, the Lillian Eichelberger Cannon Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The new material, in contrast, is soft and tiny, composed of particles just a few micrometers in diameter far less than the width of a human hair that disperse easily in a saline solution so they can be injected. The particles also degrade naturally inside the body after a few months, so no surgery would be needed to remove them. Nanoscale  sponge  Each particle is built of two types of silicon that together form a structure full of nano-scale pores, like a tiny sponge. And like a sponge, it is also squishy a hundred to a thousand times less rigid than the familiar crystalline silicon used in transistors and solar cells.  It is comparable to the rigidity of the collagen fibers in our bodies,  said Yuanwen Jiang, Tian s graduate student.  So we re creating a material that matches the rigidity of real tissue.  The material constitutes half of an electrical device that creates itself spontaneously when one of the silicon particles is injected into a cell culture, or, eventually, a human body. The particle attaches to a cell, making an interface with the cell s plasma membrane. Those two elements together cell membrane plus particle form a unit that generates current when light is shined on the silicon particle.  You don t need to inject the entire device; you just need to inject one component,  said Jo o L. Carvalho-de-Souza, a postdoctoral scholar in Bezanilla s lab.  This single particle connection with the cell membrane allows sufficient generation of current that could be used to stimulate the cell and change its activity. After you achieve your therapeutic goal, the material degrades naturally. And if you want to do therapy again, you do another injection.  The scientists built the particles using a process they call nano-casting. They fabricate a silicon dioxide mold composed of tiny channels, or  nano-wires,  about seven nanometers in diameter and connected by much smaller  micro-bridges.  Into the mold they inject silane gas, which fills the pores and channels and decomposes into silicon. And this is where things get particularly cunning. The scientists exploit the fact the smaller an object is, the more the atoms on its surface dominate its reactions to what is around it. The micro-bridges are minute, so most of their atoms are on the surface. These interact with oxygen that is present in the silicon dioxide mold, creating micro-bridges made of oxidized silicon gleaned from materials at hand. The much larger nano-wires have proportionately fewer surface atoms, are much less interactive and remain mostly pure silicon.  This is the beauty of nanoscience,  Jiang said.  It allows you to engineer chemical compositions just by manipulating the size of things.  Web-like nanostructure Finally, the mold is dissolved. What remains is a web-like structure of silicon nano-wires connected by micro-bridges of oxidized silicon that can absorb water and help increase the structure s softness. The pure silicon retains its ability to absorb light. A transmission X-ray microscopy 3-D data set of one region of a mesostructured silicon particle, suggesting spongy structures. The purple square measures 8.28 microns along the top edges, which is much less than the width of a human hair. The scientists have added the particles onto neurons in culture in the lab, shone light on the particles, and seen current flow into the neurons which activates the cells. The next step is to see what happens in living animals. They are particularly interested in stimulating nerves in the peripheral nervous system that connect to organs. These nerves are relatively close to the surface of the body, so near-infra-red wavelength light can reach them through the skin. Tian imagines using the light-activated devices to engineer human tissue and create artificial organs to replace damaged ones. Currently, scientists can make engineered organs with the correct form but not the ideal function. To get a lab-built organ to function properly, they will need to be able to manipulate individual cells in the engineered tissue. The injectable device would allow a scientist to do that, tweaking an individual cell using a tightly focused beam of light like a mechanic reaching into an engine and turning a single bolt. The possibility of doing this kind of synthetic biology without genetic engineering is enticing.  No one wants their genetics to be altered,  Tian said.  It can be risky. There s a need for a non-genetic system that can still manipulate cell behaviour. This could be that kind of system.  Jiang did the material development and characterization on the project, while Carvalho-de-Souza did the biological component of the collaboration in Bezanilla s lab. They were, said Tian, the  heroes  of the work.","Published: July 8, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mutations-in-dnarepair-gene-higher-in-prostate-cancer-201760,Mutations in DNA Repair Gene Higher in Prostate Cancer Men with aggressive prostate cancer have higher incidence of inherited DNA repair gene mutations  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.The incidence of inherited DNA-repair gene mutations appears to be significantly higher among men with more aggressive prostate cancers, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.   The take home message,  said Dr. Colin Pritchard, University of Washington associate professor of laboratory medicine and a UW Medicine physician scientist,  is that inherited causes of metastatic prostate cancer may be more common than we originally thought.  Pritchard is the lead scientist, and Dr. Peter Nelson, UW professor of medicine, Division of Oncology and a Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center investigator, is the senior author, along with several others, of the multi-institutional study.   Among the 692 patients with advanced prostate cancer who were analyzed, 82 men, nearly 12 percent, had presumably harmful DNA-repair mutations. These mutations were found among 16 genes. In other patient populations, some of these genes have been associated with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and other cancers.  The genes include BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, BRCA1, RAD51D and PALB2. Like diligent proofreaders, these repair genes correct errors during the copying of the genetic code in a person s cells.  If a DNA-repair gene itself is defective and malfunctions, mistakes can slip by, sometimes allowing cells to divide and multiply abnormally and relocate elsewhere, a hallmark of serious cancer. Among 499 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent genetic testing, most of whom had high-risk disease, the prevalence of DNA repair gene mutations is 4.6 percent.  In the Exome Aggregation Consortium, which includes more than 53,000 men without a known cancer diagnosis, the prevalence was 2.7 percent.  Testing men with metastatic prostate cancer for DNA-repair gene mutations could assist in predicting the results of therapeutic options, Pritchard said.  Men with metastatic cancer who have such mutations have been reported to have sustained responses to PARP inhibitors, now approved for ovarian cancer, and platinum-based chemotherapy, the researchers noted.  We need more data, but the initial findings offer a biological rationale for looking more closely at these drugs for metastatic prostate cancer,  Pritchard said. The hope is that eventually tests to uncover DNA-repair gene defects might point to clear, precision medicine treatment pathways. The researchers also observed that the frequency of the mutations among the men in their study did not differ according to age or family history of prostate cancer.  This finding, too, might influence clinical practice and be of help to a patient s offspring and other relatives.   Usually men are asked by their doctors if they had male relatives who had prostate cancer, but not about any female relatives with breast or ovarian cancer,  Pritchard said. The same inherited gene mutation might predispose various members of a family to different types of cancers.   Detecting a DNA-repair gene mutation in a man with metastatic prostate cancer may have implications for his family, males as well as females, in looking at their own cancer risks,  said Pritchard, who is the associate director of the genetics and solid tumour clinical laboratory at UW Medical Center. He added that it is a matter of public education to help people realize that mutations in genes usually regarded as related to breast cancer or ovarian cancer do occur in men.  If he could design a news magazine cover, he said, it would say,  Breast cancer genes are for men, too.   There s not a lot of awareness of this,  Pritchard said,  Their effects are just not as well understood in men. They were once thought to be rare, but they are not as rare as previously thought.  He also explained that prostate cancer is among the most heritable of cancers in people.  Genetic factors might account for about 57 percent of the difference in risk across individuals. Genomic studies have discovered more than 100 widely occurring genetic variants in families who have a greater than average incidence of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is very common. In their lifetimes, 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with the condition.  Its natural history is varied.  Some low-grade forms cause no trouble for decades after they are diagnosed, other cases progress quickly and are lethal, Pritchard said. Genetic and clinical variability has posed obstacles to discovering useful test markers and designing screening strategies that lead to neither overtreatment nor under-detection.  The prognosis for prostate cancer is often evaluated through a Gleason score on a biopsy, or sample of prostate tissue.  If the sample looks more like normal tissue, it gets a low score. The less it resembles normal tissue, the greater the score and the more likely it is to spread. Because DNA repair gene mutations are linked with both clinically aggressive disease and high Gleason scores, and because the findings might suggest using already available treatments, the researchers proposed routinely examining all men with metastatic prostate cancer for the presence of these gene mutations.  They emphasized the importance of counseling on the known and unknown significance of specific test results. The data for the study came from seven case series of men with prostate cancer from many institutions in the United States and the United Kingdom.  The case series included the Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer Foundation International Prostate Cancer Dream Team discovery and validation groups, the Royal Marsden Prostate Cancer Genomics cohort, patients from the University of Washington and the University of Michigan rapid autopsy programs, the Weill Cornell Medical College precision medicine program, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets study.  The research was funded by Stand Up to Cancer, a program of the Entertainment Industry Foundation; the Prostate Cancer Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Prostate Cancer Foundation Movember Challenge program, and several public agency grants and private foundation awards to individual researchers or their institutions. These funders include the Institute for Prostate Cancer Research, which supports studies at UW Medicine and Fred Hutch. In their published research article,  Inherited DNA-Repair Gene Mutations in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer,  the researchers expressed their thanks to the men who participated for helping scientists obtain a better understanding of the role of genetic predisposition in advanced prostate cancer.

Stage 2 tumors, in general, have invaded nearby tissues but not spread to other organs, and uncertainty has long surrounded the question of whether chemotherapy prescribed after surgical treatment is beneficial.  Most patients with stage 2 colon cancers will be cured of the disease after surgery alone,  says Bert Vogelstein, M.D., co-director of the Ludwig Center at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.  However, some of these cancers will recur, and we need to improve our diagnostic approaches to detect recurrence earlier than it can be found with current, conventional methods.  Labs worldwide are working on DNA-based tests. For the current study, the scientists followed 230 stage 2 colon cancer patients in 13 hospitals in Australia for four years, beginning in 2011, collecting more than 1,000 blood samples from them. After scanning the genetic sequences of tissue taken from the patients  tumors during surgery, the scientists, led by Kimmel Cancer Center graduate student Yuxuan Wang, identified at least one colon cancer-related gene mutation in the patients  original tumor. Over time, they tracked each patient s cancer-related mutation in his or her blood samples, taken between four and 10 weeks after their surgery and every three months afterward for up to two years. The tracking used highly sensitive genetic tests to locate and amplify DNA found there. Patients also underwent a CT scan of their entire body every six months after surgery for two years. Among the 230 patients, 20 had cancer-linked DNA fragments in their blood, including 14 who did not to receive additional chemotherapy and six who did. Of the 14, 11 developed a recurrence, found on a CT scan, during the study. Of the six who received additional chemotherapy, three experienced a recurrence of their cancers during the study period. An additional 14 patients experienced cancer recurrences, but their blood tests showed no cancer-linked DNA.  Although this and other DNA-based blood tests are not perfect, this study shows that when we find tumor DNA circulating in the blood of cancer patients, recurrence is very likely,  says Nickolas Papadopoulos, Ph.D., professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of its Kimmel Cancer Center. Currently, some 40 percent of patients with stage 2 colon cancers are considered at risk for recurrence as a result of measuring how far the cancer has grown into the intestine s wall, the number of lymph nodes examined during surgery, and whether the cancer has spread to blood or lymphatic vessels. Those deemed at higher risk are usually treated with chemotherapy following their surgery, but efforts to demonstrate the benefit of such additional therapies have been hampered by the lack of large-scale studies with the statistical power to show any benefit in terms of survival, say the researchers. Vogelstein says better methods to predict risk for recurrence, such as the genetic-based blood test described in this study, could identify a very-high-risk subset of patients who can form the basis of rigorous study of the benefit of additional treatment. The new findings affirm how research on cancer diagnostics goes hand in hand with research on new therapies, says Vogelstein, the Clayton Professor of Oncology at Johns Hopkins and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  There is mounting evidence that ctDNA is a viable approach for earlier detection of cancer recurrence, and more research is underway to refine the technology, improve its sensitivity and determine the best testing intervals,  says Kenneth Kinzler, Ph.D, co-director of the Ludwig Center at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. There are currently no DNA-based blood tests for cancer approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, although several biotechnology companies are designing and studying them as the result of prior research conducted at Johns Hopkins. Costs of the tests are estimated to range in the many hundreds to thousands of dollars, and it is unclear whether health insurance companies would reimburse costs related to the testing.","Published: July 8, 2016"

Reporting in Nature, researchers at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children s Hospital describe new potential avenues for controlling both sepsis and the runaway bacterial infections that provoke it. Sepsis kills a quarter million people each year in the United States and is the largest killer of newborns and children worldwide. Like antibiotic-resistant infections, it has no good treatment. Through scrupulous experiments, scientists in Boston Children s Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine (PCMM) have uncovered the final cellular events necessary for both sepsis and stemming the bacterial attack. Recent research has shown that at any sign of bacterial invasion, protein complexes called inflammasomes are activated. This activation triggers a process called pyroptosis   the infected cells explode open, releasing bacteria as well as chemical signals that sound an immune alarm. But there s a balance: Too urgent an alarm can trigger sepsis, causing fatal blood-vessel and organ damage.  The immune system is trying like hell to control the infection, but if the bacteria win out, the immune response can kill the patient,  explains Judy Lieberman, senior investigator on the study together with Hao Wu, also in the PCMM.  Most attempts to quiet the immune response haven t worked in treating sepsis in the clinic, because the parts that trigger it haven t been well understood. Once activated, inflammasomes activate enzymes called caspases that cut a molecule called gasdermin D in two. This cleavage unleashes gasdermin D s active fragment, known as gasdermin-D-NT. But how this causes pyroptosis hasn t been known. Lieberman, Wu, and their colleagues now show that gasdermin-D-NT packs a one-two punch. On the one hand, it perforates the membranes of the bacteria that are infecting cells and kills them. It also punches holes in the membrane of the host cell, causing pyroptosis   killing the cell and releasing bacteria and immune alarm signals. The team also found that nearby uninfected cells were left unscathed. Second, the team discovered that gasdermin-D-NT directly kills bacteria outside cells, including E. coli, S. aureus, and Listeria. In a dish, this happened quickly   within five minutes. The results need to be replicated in animal models of infection and sepsis, but Lieberman believes that understanding how gasdermin-D-NT works could be harnessed to help treat highly dangerous bacterial infections.  Because of widespread antibiotic resistance, we have to think about other strategies,  she says.  Since the fragment kills bacteria but not uninfected host cells, one can imagine injecting the fragment directly, especially to treat a localized infection involving antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  For sepsis, Lieberman speculates about ways of inhibiting or blocking gasdermin-D-NT, such as with antibodies or strategies targeting caspase enzymes. Xing Liu, Zhibin Zhang, and Jianbin Ruan are co-first authors on the paper. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.","Published: July 8, 2016"

The blood-based test detects the V7 variant of the androgen receptor protein (AR-V7) in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells (CTC)   information that can help guide treatment selection in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). AR-V7 expression has been associated with resistance to hormone therapy drugs called androgen receptor signaling (ARS) inhibitors. A recently published study in JAMA Oncology from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center demonstrated that mCRPC patients with AR-V7 positive CTCs had significantly better clinical outcomes when treated with taxane chemotherapy, which suggests that patients with detectable blood levels of AR-V7 should consider life prolonging chemotherapy as an alternative to potentially less effective and more expensive hormonal treatment with ARS drugs. These study results underscore the potential for an AR-V7 predictive test to allow advanced prostate cancer patients to avoid ineffective therapies and to receive chemotherapy at an earlier stage when it may be more beneficial.  The validation study published in JAMA Oncology demonstrated that patients with AR-V7 positive CTCs have longer survival on taxane chemotherapy relative to those on AR signaling inhibitors,  said Dr. Howard Scher, M.D., study principal investigator and chief of Genitourinary Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York.  The growing body of evidence for the clinical utility of AR-V7 supports its use in clinical practice as a treatment-specific biomarker to guide treatment selection for patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Virtually all men with metastatic prostate cancer eventually develop mCRPC, an advanced stage of the disease where the standard of care includes abiraterone, enzalutamide and taxanes. It is estimated that each year, about 50,000 mCRPC patients could benefit from knowing their AR-V7 status prior to selecting further treatment. With the use of this new test, the two companies estimate substantial healthcare savings per patient tested by tailoring treatment selection.  Epic Sciences  no cell left behind  platform offers the highest clinical sensitivity and specificity for nuclear AR-V7 characterization. This enables a best-in-class test that provides clinically actionable information that can directly affect patient outcomes and health economics,  said Murali Prahalad, president and chief executive officer, Epic Sciences.  The Epic Sciences AR-V7 test is the first of many groundbreaking tests we are developing, and our collaboration with Genomic Health is an important milestone to realize its commercial potential with a world-class partner.   This strategic collaboration allows us to leverage our successful commercial channel while continuing to generate growth across our business,  said Frederic Pla, Ph.D., chief business and product development officer, Genomic Health.  Epic Sciences  industry leading CTC-based platform enables the delivery of clinically actionable information to prostate cancer patients at a critical treatment decision point. Offered as part of our Oncotype IQ  Genomic Intelligence Platform that collectively assesses DNA, RNA, and protein using either PCR, NGS, or image-based analysis, Epic Sciences  AR-V7 test will complement our expanding portfolio, which also includes Oncotype SEQ , our recently launched liquid biopsy mutation panel.  Based on the agreement, Genomic Health will have exclusive distribution rights to market and sell the new Epic Sciences liquid biopsy test in the U.S. beginning in early 2017. The test will be offered through Genomic Health s commercial channel to enable physicians to order the test and view the results through the current physician portal. The test will be performed by Epic Sciences at its centralized, CLIA-certified laboratory in San Diego, Calif. As part of the agreement, Genomic Health will make an equity investment in Epic Sciences. Further financial terms will not be disclosed at this time.","Published: July 8, 2016"

RA is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects millions of people in the United States and Western Europe. TNF -inhibiting therapies, the blockbusters representing a multibillion dollar market, have shown a major breakthrough in the treatment of RA. However, these drugs are found to lack efficacy in an estimated 30 to 40 percent of patients (non-responders). The RABIOPRED* tool aims to identify the non-responders to improve patient management. Under the agreement, HTG will supply instrumentation and reagents to support Firalis  development, validation, and clinical deployment of RABIOPRED, a biomarker assay to predict treatment response in RA, using the NGS-based HTG EdgeSeq system.  Firalis was the first adopter of the HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems in Europe, and we are pleased to expand our relationship through this personalized medicine initiative,  said TJ Johnson, President and CEO of HTG.  We are also happy to have Firalis as a certified service provider. Millions of RA patients are treated with TNF -inhibiting agents but the clinicians currently are unable to predict patient response to these expensive biologicals,  said Hueseyin Firat, President & CEO of Firalis.  We believe the ability to predict response to anti-TNF  treatment would greatly improve clinical decision-making, improve health outcomes for RA patients, and contribute to cost reduction and sustainability of the health care system.

The transaction is expected to close on or about August 1, 2016, with closing subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash on hand and a revolving line of credit facility that Bio-Techne expects to obtain prior to the closing of the acquisition. Charles R. Kummeth, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne, commented, ""We are very pleased to have ACD as part of Bio-Techne Corporation. First of all, ACD marks Bio-Techne's entry into the genomics field and market. Second, and more importantly, its innovative and versatile technology has the potential to change pathology practices. RNA-ISH is a transformative technology facilitating and improving the monitoring of gene expression patterns at the single cell level--while retaining the morphological context of the tissue being analyzed. ACD's technology serves both research and diagnostic markets, expanding Bio-Techne's presence in the clinical lab setting. With broader adoption of the technology in the diagnostic arena, it has the potential to revolutionize the choice of reagents in diagnostic practices, such as oncology, infectious diseases and others. As we continue to expand the portfolio of products and technologies we bring to our customers, we view the leading-edge ACD products as a natural and complementary extension of the Bio-Techne product offering, with the ultimate goal to more completely address our customers' varied needs in the research and clinical space."" ACD Chief Executive Officer Dr. Yuling Luo added, ""Strategically, the fit between the two companies is excellent. Both companies share the passion to empower cutting-edge science with innovative quality reagents. Both ACD and Bio-Techne are dedicated to improving life science research and health care by providing customers with the best possible tools and reagents. The combined business represents a one-stop-shop for our customers and positions us well to compete and expand in the global market."" ACD develops and commercializes proprietary consumables for genomic analysis, reinventing the widely used in-situ hybridization technique. More specifically, ACD's highly sensitive RNA in-situ hybridization technology, commercialized under the RNAscope brand name, makes it possible to visualize expression of virtually any gene in individual cells while retaining valuable tissue morphology information. This molecular detection of biomarkers and other key genetic information at, the single cell level, is far more informative than the bulk cell population analysis provided by traditional gene amplification approaches. Importantly, ACD reagents also have numerous potential applications in the diagnostic and companion diagnostic arena, simplifying traditional immunohistochemistry-based pathology practices currently reliant on difficult-to-develop and often poorly validated antibodies. ACD's proprietary technology could provide pathologists with more robust reagents capable of specifically detecting transcripts of expressed genes, noncoding RNAs, as well as more subtle genetic details such as gene splice variants, gene fusions, copy number variations and single nucleotide polymorphisms. At the core of the ACD technology is the greatly enhanced detection sensitivity of RNA-ISH (RNA in-situ hybridization). RNAscope is a patent protected target hybridization and signal amplification technology enabling the detection of single RNA molecules in single cells. Founded in 2006 by noted scientists and entrepreneurs Dr. Yuling Luo and Dr. Steve Chen, ACD presently has over 100 employees. Its product line of over 9,000 probe reagents and reagent kits for manual and automated use is sold worldwide, and achieved annual revenues of approximately $25 million for the last twelve months with an annualized growth rate of approximately 50%. The acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to Bio-Techne's adjusted earnings per share for its fiscal year 2017, and accretive thereafter.

The research, which links the spread of the parasite back to colonial seafaring, among other phenomena, underscores the challenges health experts face in controlling the parasite.  Plasmodium vivax is going to be the last malaria parasite standing,  observes Jane Carlton, a professor in New York University s Department of Biology, who led the study.  Our findings show it is evolving in response to anti-malarial drugs and adapting to regional differences, indicating a wide range of approaches will likely be necessary to eliminate it globally.   The DNA data show that P. vivax has clearly had a different history of association with global human populations than other malaria parasites, indicating that unique aspects of its biology may have influenced the ways in which it spread around the world,  adds Daniel Neafsey, associate director of the Genomic Center for Infectious Disease at the Broad Institute, who generated the data and co-led the analysis. P. vivax causes an estimated 15.8 million clinical malaria cases each year. However, it remains understudied because it is both less lethal than other species and because it has historically been difficult to analyze since it cannot be grown in the laboratory. Another challenge is separating the parasite s DNA from human DNA. In their study, which appears in the journal Nature Genetics, the research team sequenced approximately 200 DNA samples of P. vivax collected from patients the largest number of P. vivax genomes sequenced to date in 11 countries, including Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Peru, and Thailand. The scientists were able to separate P. vivax DNA from its human host by using a set of unique  sticky baits  that captured the parasite DNA, enabling the human DNA to be washed away. The researchers collected patient samples through the International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research, a global network of independent research centers in malaria-endemic settings that provide knowledge, tools, and evidence-based strategies to support in-country researchers working in a variety of settings, especially within governments and healthcare institutions. The sequencing of the parasite s genome offered an array of new insights into the nature of P. vivax as it exists and also served as a  genetic history book  of the studied regions:  Central and South American P. vivax populations are very genetically diverse and distinct from all other contemporary P. vivax populations, suggesting that New World parasites may have been introduced by colonial seafarers and represent a now-eliminated European parasite population. Contemporary African and South Asian P. vivax populations are genetically similar, suggesting that South Asian P. vivax populations may have genetically mingled with European lineages during the colonial era or, alternatively, reflect ancient connections between human populations in the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent. The relatively homogeneous genetic makeup of P. vivax in Mexico reflects a steady decline of the disease in this country over the last decade, falling to under 10,000 cases. By contrast, the Papua New Guinea (PNG) population of P. vivax is very diverse relative to other P. vivax populations, with implications for developing different methods of control in this region of the world. P. vivax is significantly more genetically diverse than the more widely studied and deadlier malaria species P. falciparum, which may make it more elusive to methods of control and thus more difficult to eliminate. Resistant forms of two genes associated with antimalarial drug resistance have swept through the global population. Several genes were identified as adapting to regional differences in the human host and mosquito vector--for example, a gene involved in evasion of the mosquito immune response that enabled the species to successfully adapt to development and transmission in New World mosquito species. The research was conducted through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/National Institutes of Health (NIH) International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (U19AI089676, U19AI089681, U19AI089686, U19AI089672, U19AI089702) and Contract No. HHSN272200900018C, as well as supported by the National Council for Science and Technology Mexico (29005-M SALUD-2004-119), and the Victorian State Government Operational Infrastructure Support and the Australian Government (NHMRC IRIISS), among others.","Published: July 8, 2016"

High AMPK activity levels significantly increase the firing of ""hunger"" neurons known as AgRP neurons, leading to greater food intake, body weight and fat mass in mouse models. Blocking AMPK activity in mice led to reduced hunger and AgRP neuron firing, even after fasting. The research team found that AMPK alters the ability of AgRP neurons to form synapses. The study sheds light on the biological mechanisms that regulate feeding behavior, and serves as a potential model for the broad study of synapse formation. See Also: Research indicates food craving is  hard-wired  in the brain ""We know that AgRP is a master neuron group that controls hunger, and it is critical that we understand how these neurons are regulated since dysfunction may lead to obesity or anorexia,"" said study author Dong Kong, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at Tufts University School of Medicine. Located in the hypothalamus, AgRP (agouti-related peptide)-expressing neurons play an important role in feeding behavior. Experiments have shown that over-activation of these ""hunger"" neurons can cause mice to continue eating even when full. When AgRP neuron activity is blocked, mice cease eating. While AgRP neurons are known to be activated by fasting and the hormone ghrelin (produced by an empty stomach), and inhibited by the hormone leptin (produced by fat cells), less is known about their underlying biological mechanisms. To investigate, Kong and his colleagues focused on AMPK, a metabolic sensor protein involved in energy regulation that can be found in most cells. AMPK activity has been shown to be triggered by fasting and ghrelin, mirroring AgRP neuron activation patterns. But its role in neurons was unclear. The researchers began by developing a suite of genetic tools that allowed them to assess AMPK activity in mice and manipulate its signaling in only AgRP neurons, leaving other cell types unaltered. The team found that AMPK activity in AgRP neurons was more than double in fasted animals compared to animals in a sated state. They then engineered mice with continuously activated AMPK protein. This caused increased AgRP neuron firing and higher food intake, body weight and fat mass in both fasted mice and mice that had unlimited access to food. Blocking AMPK activity produced the opposite effect and decreased AgRP neuron activity. Learn More: Obese teens' brains unusually susceptible to food commercials, study findsIn addition to altering the frequency and rate of firing of AgRP neurons, AMPK also affected the formation of dendritic spines--structures on neurons involved in neurotransmission, which receive synaptic inputs from other neurons. In a previous study, Kong and his colleagues found that dendritic spine density directly correlated with the effect of AgRP neurons on hunger. In the current study, the team confirmed that high levels of AMPK activity caused high AgRP dendritic spine density, while blocking AMPK activation halted spine formation. ""We previously found that fasting can drive feeding behavior with increased synapse formation and firing activity in AgRP neurons, and we have now shown that AMPK is both necessary and sufficient for this to occur,"" said Kong, who serves as faculty in the Neuroscience and Cell, Molecular & Developmental Biology programs at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts. ""Even in a fed state, mice with continuously active AMPK have higher AgRP activity, eat more, and develop obesity faster."" Kong and his colleagues further examined how AMPK affected dendritic spine formation by studying PAKs, a group of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity that AMPK is known to act on. The team found that specifically blocking PAKs inhibited AgRP neuron activity and dendritic spine formation in fasted mice--even in mice with AMPK continuously activated. Their findings suggest that PAKs are required for AMPK activation of AgRP neurons, and play an important role in AMPK-mediated synaptic plasticity. Kong cautions that AMPK and PAKs are currently not ideal therapeutic targets, due to their widespread presence in cells throughout the body. However, clarifying the biological mechanisms by which AgRP neurons function is necessary for future research efforts to identify more suitable targets, he says. Kong and his laboratory at Tufts are now further exploring the mechanisms by which AMPK, PAKs and AgRP neurons interact with each other, and with other signaling factors important for feeding such as leptin, ghrelin, insulin and glucose.

The team of scientists, led by Dr. Marc Goodfellow and Professor John Terry, have developed the ground-breaking new method that can identify the specific regions of the brain that trigger seizures in people with epilepsy. The new technique is designed to help surgeons and neurologists measure the relative contribution to the occurrence of seizures made by different brain regions, and so determine the brain regions to remove that will have most benefit to the individual. See Also: MRI-guided laser procedure provides alternative to epilepsy surgery At present, people with epilepsy are treated initially through medication, which aims to dramatically reduce or remove the threat of seizures. However anti-epilepsy drugs prove ineffective in around one-third of people. In these cases, patients can elect to undergo surgery to remove small parts of the brain which does not impact healthy brain function but which can help reduce the chance of experiencing seizures. Surgeons record electrical activity from the surface of the brain and study the electrical rhythms to attempt to identify the brain regions where seizures begin. However, current approaches are only partially effective with around 50% of people with epilepsy seeing significant long-term improvements following surgery. The new method devised by the scientists, which used state-of-the-art mathematical modelling procedures, can more accurately distinguish the brain regions that are the source of seizure activity from those that become involved as a result of a seizure starting. Professor Terry, Director of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare and an expert in Biological Modelling from Exeter's Mathematics department said: ""This research has the potential to dramatically improve surgical success rates can be for those patients who need it, and so also dramatically improve their quality of life. Don't Miss: Having a relative with epilepsy may increase your risk of being diagnosed with autism ""The potential is truly outstanding. It gives surgeons valuable information on how different brain regions contribute to seizures, enabling them to predict the outcome of different surgical strategies and so better plan surgery. ""Imagine someone was in a theatre and sending text messages to random audience members, making their phones ring. Current techniques are in essence akin to removing those people who receive the messages they are contributing to the disruption and so removing them could make a difference. But clearly it would be better to identify and remove the individual sending out the messages the original source. That is what our methods achieve identifying the original source."" The team honed their new methods through studying the electrical recordings from a series of 16 people with epilepsy who have undergone surgery to treat seizures at a clinic in Switzerland. They used the readings from before surgery to run their advanced model, and predict which areas would produce the most effective results. Crucially, they then compared their predictions to the actual outcomes achieved through surgery. For people who responded well to surgery the brain regions removed by the surgeons were amongst those predicted by the model as leading to a good outcome. In contrast, for people who did not respond well to surgery the brain regions removed were not amongst those predicted by the model as leading to a good outcome.

""By using the powerful two-photon microscope, we were able to observe the activity of individual cells in the mouse hippocampus, and then link that activity to a specific behavior in this case, navigation a technological feat that would have been impossible just a few years ago."" The hippocampus can be divided into distinct areas that form an interconnected circuit through which memory-related information is processed. For this study, Dr. Losonczy and his team focused on the hippocampus' main output node, area CA1, which was discovered by scientists to encode one's location work that was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize. ""We've known that CA1 can be divided into two distinct sublayers of cells: the deep and superficial sublayers,"" said Nathan Danielson, a doctoral candidate in neuroscience at CUMC and the paper's first author. ""Scientists have wondered whether this division was an indication that these two sublayers actually served different purposes in learning and memory. But no one had tested it, so we decided to look."" Learn more: Mazes and brains: When preconception trumps logicTo study these cells, the researchers placed mice on treadmills that had distinct colors, textures and smells while a two-photon microscope monitored the cellular activity in the CA1. The mice then performed two tasks. In the first, mice ran on a treadmill while experiencing different sights and sounds, some familiar and others new. In the second, mice were given the task of finding a water reward placed at a specific, unmarked location along the treadmill. The team repeated these experiments over the course of several sessions and monitored how each of the sublayers responded to the different types of learning. When the mice performed the first task, cells in the superficial sublayer of CA1 appeared to create an internal map that remained largely unchanged from session to session. By contrast, cells in the deep sublayer formed an internal map that was far more dynamic -- in effect redrawing a different version of the map during each session. During the second task, however, when the mice needed to learn the location of the hidden reward, the maps in the deep sublayer were significantly more stable, and less dynamic, than in the first task. The scientists also found that deep-sublayer activity was closely linked to the animal's ability to find the reward. This distinction between the sublayers, the authors argue, could signify two different processes important for navigation. ""If you're walking down the street looking for something specific say, your favorite restaurant your brain first needs a map of the neighborhood in general,"" said Danielson. But to find that particular restaurant, he continued, the brain also assigns importance, or salience, to that specific location. ""In a sense, it's the brain's way of marking a location on a map with a giant X,"" Danielson said. ""So as you look for that restaurant, you need both the map and the X. Our findings suggest that, in the brain, these distinct types of information could be conveyed by the CA1's distinct sublayers."" Don't Miss: Humans  built-in GPS is our 3-D sense of smell ""And if one month later you wanted to visit somewhere new, the deep sublayer would update the map, effectively marking the spot of the new location, while the underlying map of the neighborhood, created by the superficial sublayer, would remain relatively unchanged,"" added Dr. Losonczy. For Dr. Losonczy, this study speaks to the ingenious way that the brain's underlying architecture allows it to accomplish a specific type of navigation. ""It's astounding that the ability to navigate to a desired location, an enormously complex feat, can be represented so precisely in the structure of the hippocampus,"" he said. ""And it's even more astounding that we can now witness it happening in real time."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-clue-how-lithium-works-brain-284393,New clue to how lithium works in the brain  Biologists find a possible explanation for why the drug helps bipolar patients  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Biologists find a possible explanation for why the drug helps bipolar patients - Since the 1970s, U.S. doctors have prescribed lithium to treat patients with bipolar disorder. While the drug has a good success rate, scientists are still unsure exactly how it achieves its beneficial effects. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) biologists have now discovered a possible explanation for how lithium works. In a study of roundworms, the researchers identified a key protein that is inhibited by lithium, making the worms less active. While these behavioral effects in worms can't be translated directly to humans, the results suggest a possible mechanism for lithium's effects on the brain, which the researchers believe is worth exploring further. See Also: MRI scan sensitive to metabolic changes reveals brain differences in bipolar disorder ""How lithium acts on the brain has been this great mystery of psychopharmacology,"" says Joshua Meisel, an MIT postdoc and lead author of the study. ""There are hypotheses, but nothing's been proven."" Dennis Kim, an associate professor of biology, is the senior author of the paper, which appears in Current Biology. Lithium's ability to act as a tranquilizer for people suffering from mania and bipolar disorder was discovered in 1949 by the Australian psychiatrist John Cade, but the drug was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until 1970. Lithium interacts with many proteins and other molecules in the brain, so it has been difficult for scientists to determine which of these interactions produce mood stabilization. Some of the hypothesized targets are an enzyme that produces inositol, a simple sugar involved in cell signaling, and an enzyme called GSK3, which inactivates other proteins. However, no studies have conclusively linked these targets to lithium's effects on bipolar patients. The MIT team did not set out to study lithium but fell upon it while exploring interactions between Caenorhabditis elegans and its microbial environment. This worm has a simple nervous system consisting of 302 neurons, most of which occur in pairs. Related: Study offers clues to early detection of bipolar disorders in high-risk childrenIn a paper published in 2014, Meisel and Kim discovered that a pair of neurons known as ASJ neurons are necessary for the worm's avoidance of harmful bacteria. Previous studies from other labs had shown that the ASJ neurons are also required for reawakening from a starvation-induced hibernation state. This reactivation, known as the dauer exit, occurs when food becomes more plentiful. As a follow-up to that study, the researchers performed a genetic screen in which they looked for mutated genes that disrupt ASJ neurons. To their surprise, one of the genes implicated by this screen was one that codes for a protein called BPNT1, which was already known to be inhibited by lithium. BPNT1 is a protein that removes phosphate groups from a compound known as PAP, a process that is critical to maintaining normal cell function. When the researchers knocked out the gene for BPNT1, they found that the ASJ neurons entered a dormant state and the worms could no longer execute either avoidance behavior or the dauer exit. They also found the same behavioral effects in worms treated with lithium. The findings suggest that lithium treatment silences activity in neurons that rely on BPNT1, which Meisel and Kim found intriguing because many human brain cells also depend on this protein. In humans, PAP, which BPNT1 degrades, is usually found in neurons that secrete dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine, which are all neurotransmitters that stimulate brain activity. ""We think that it's perfectly reasonable to add BPNT1 onto the list of hypotheses for how lithium is affecting the brain,"" Meisel says. ""Silencing dopaminergic neurons I would think would make you less manic because of how dopamine affects the brain."" Learn More: Changes in brain connectivity protect against developing bipolar disorderWhile Kim's lab focuses on worms, the researchers hope that other labs will test the new hypothesis in other animals. ""Establishing that this happens in C. elegans, by no means does it prove how lithium works in humans, but it provides a very solid experimental foundation for exploring a hypothesis that lithium might have therapeutic effects in specific neurons through inhibition of BPNT1,"" Kim says. ""We hope that other groups that work on mammalian systems may be interested to explore this question further."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Helium doesn t just make your voice squeaky   it is critical to many thingswe take for granted, including MRI scanners in medicine, welding, industrialleak detection and nuclear energy. However, known reserves are quickly runningout. Until now helium has never been found intentionally   being accidentallydiscovered in small quantities during oil and gas drilling. Now, a research group from Oxford and Durham universities, working withHelium One, a Norway-headquartered helium exploration company, has developed abrand new exploration approach. The first use of this method has resulted inthe discovery of a world-class helium gas field in Tanzania. Their research shows that volcanic activity provides the intense heatnecessary to release the gas from ancient, helium-bearing rocks. Within theTanzanian East African Rift Valley, volcanoes have released helium from ancientdeep rocks and have trapped this helium in shallower gas fields. The researchis being presented by Durham University PhD student Diveena Danabalan at theGoldschmidt geochemistry conference in Yokohama, Japan. Diveena Danabalan, of Durham University s Department of Earth Sciences,said:  We show that volcanoes in the Rift play an important role in theformation of viable helium reserves. Volcanic activity likely provides the heatnecessary to release the helium accumulated in ancient crustal rocks. However,if gas traps are located too close to a given volcano, they run the risk ofhelium being heavily diluted by volcanic gases such as carbon dioxide, just aswe see in thermal springs from the region. We are now working to identify the goldilocks-zone  between the ancient crust and the modern volcanoes where thebalance between helium release and volcanic dilution is  just right .  Professor Chris Ballentine, Department of Earth Sciences, University ofOxford, said:  We sampled helium gas (and nitrogen) just bubbling out of theground in the Tanzanian East African Rift valley. By combining ourunderstanding of helium geochemistry with seismic images of gas trappingstructures, independent experts have calculated a probable resource of 54Billion Cubic Feet (BCf) in just one part of the rift valley. This is enough tofill over 1.2 million medical MRI scanners. To put this discovery intoperspective, global consumption of helium is about 8 BCf per year and theUnited States Federal Helium Reserve, which is the world s largest supplier,has a current reserve of just 24.2 BCf. Total known reserves in the USA arearound 153 BCf. This is a game changer for the future security of society shelium needs and similar finds in the future may not be far away.  Professor Jon Gluyas, Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, said: This is an outstanding example of industry and academia working togetherclosely to deliver real value to society. The impact of this and expectedfuture helium discoveries will secure supply for the medical scanning and otherindustries.  Dr Pete Barry, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, whosampled the gases, added:  We can apply this same strategy to other parts ofthe world with a similar geological history to find new helium resources.Excitingly, we have linked the importance of volcanic activity for heliumrelease with the presence of potential trapping structures and this studyrepresents another step towards creating a viable model for helium exploration.This is badly needed given the current demand for helium.

CCA is associated with multiple risk factors that are geographically distinct   choledocal cysts and primary sclerosing cholangitis have been implicated in the development of CCA in Western populations, while infections by the liver fluke parasite have resulted in higher incidence of CCA in Southeast Asia. However, the role of bacteria in CCA development has not been previously established, despite their relatively well-characterised involvement in colon and gastric (GI tract) cancers.  To address this gap, the team of researchers profiled the tissue microbial community of liver fluke-infected and non-infected CCA based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, a highly conserved marker gene for studying different bacterial lineages. Led by first author Dr Chng Kern Rei, Senior Research Fellow of Computational & Systems Biology at A*STAR s Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), the team discovered that bile duct tissue harboured a community of diverse bacteria species. Stenotrophomonas species   previously implicated in bile duct infections   were found to be preferentially dwelling in tumour tissue (compared to normal tissue) of non-fluke-infected CCA patients, highlighting their potential role in development of CCA. In comparison to non-fluke-infected CCA tissues, fluke-infected CCA tissues were found to contain enteric bacteria whose metabolic outputs (bile acids and ammonia) have been previously linked to carcinogenesis, or the formation of cancers. Taken together, the results suggest a role for bile duct tissue microbiome in development of CCA and which may accordingly be used as a target for therapy. Besides main collaborator National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS), this multi-national, multi-institutional project also involved National University of Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, and Duke-NUS Medical School from Singapore; Fundeni Clinical Institute from Romania; Khon Kaen University from Thailand; and Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School from the United States. Published in scientific journal EBioMedicine s June 2016 issue, the study was also featured on the cover.  Until recently, our understanding of bacterial communities resident in our body and their association with diseases has been limited. The associations detected in this study provide a smoking gun for the role of bacteria in bile duct cancer, and we hope that this discovery will accelerate our search for a cure for cholangiocarcinoma,  said Dr Nagarajan, the study s joint corresponding author and Principal Investigator of Computational & Systems Biology at the GIS.  Understanding how our cells interact with our environment and in this case our ""microbial self"" is increasingly recognized to be important for our understanding of health and disease. Such fundamental research while still in its early stages may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in time as the microbiome is far more manipulable than our genome. We are grateful to NMRC for their support in this study,  said Dr Joanne Ngeow, Co-Principal Investigator of this study and Senior Consultant Medical Oncologist, National Cancer Centre Singapore. GIS Executive Director Prof Ng Huck Hui said,  Microbiome studies are an increasingly important area of research, evident in the National Microbiome Initiative launched by the Obama administration recently. Enabled by cutting-edge technologies at GIS, I look forward to more studies in this area with a view to understanding the role of microbial communities in diseases, and eventually leading to better health outcomes for patients.

They have developed an E. coli-based transport capsule designed to help next-generation vaccines do a more efficient and effective job than today s immunizations. The research, described in a study published today (July 1) in the journal Science Advances, highlights the capsule s success in fighting pneumococcal disease, an infection that can result in pneumonia, sepsis, ear infections and meningitis.  It s a bit counterintuitive given what you hear about E. coli, but there are many strains of the bacteria, most of which are perfectly normal in the body, that have great potential to fight disease,  said Blaine A.

The core of the transport capsule the team developed is harmless E. coli. Around the bacteria, the researchers wrapped a synthetic polymer   called poly (beta amino ester)   that resembles a chain link fence. The positive-charged polymer, combined with the negative-charged bacteria cell wall, create a sort of hybrid capsule. To test the capsule, the researchers then inserted a protein-based vaccine, also being commercialized by Abcombi, designed to fight pneumococcal disease. The results, when tested in mice, were impressive. The capsule s hybrid design provided:           Both passive and active targeting of specific immune cells called antigen-presenting cells that trigger an immune response.           Natural and multicomponent adjuvant properties, which enhance the body s immune response.           Dual intracellular delivery mechanisms to direct a particular immune response.           Simultaneous production and delivery of the components (antigens) required for a vaccine.           Strong vaccination protection capabilities against pneumococcal disease. It s also relatively inexpensive to create and flexible in terms of use. For example, the capsule could be used as a delivery device for therapies that target cancer, viral-based infectious disease and other illnesses.","Published: July 7, 2016"

Starbons, made from waste biomass including food peelings and seaweed, were discovered and first reported 10 years ago by the York Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence. Using these renewable materials provides a greener, more efficient and selective approach than other commercial systems of reducing emissions. Current widespread methods of carbon capture, such as amine treating, use liquid solutions for the treatment of emissions from chemical plants and refineries. However, these are expensive to run and require a lot of input energy compared with a relatively low output. The synthetic make-up of Starbons, which contains pores, results in the absorption of up to 65 percent more CO2 than other methods. Starbons are also more selective in capturing CO2 when mixed with nitrogen, with results showing a capture rate of 20:1 rather than 5:1 - four times more selective than other methods. The materials also retain their CO2 absorption and selectivity in the presence of water, and have extremely fast rates of CO2 absorption and desorption. Such enhanced properties for carbon capture, in a material that is sustainable and low-cost to make, holds significant potential for helping to reduce emissions from many manufacturing plants and power stations in the UK and around the world. Professor Michael North, Professor of Green Chemistry at the University of York, said:  This work is of fundamental importance in overturning established wisdom associated with gas capture by solids. It defies current accepted scientific understanding of the efficiency of carbon-capturing CO2, and has the potential to be of significant commercial and governmental value in helping the UK meet its CO2emissions reduction promises. Professor James Clark, Head of York s Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence, said:  The high CO2 adsorption, high selectivity, rapid kinetics and water tolerance, combined with the low cost and ease of large scale production from waste biomass, gives Starbons great potential. We hope to offer the product as a commercial capture agent for separating CO2 from chemical or power station waste streams. ","Published: July 7, 2016"

With the partnership, LEO Pharma enters into biological medicines within dermatology and expects to significantly expand the company s future treatment offering. The deal is expected to secure an entirely new foothold in the dermatology market for LEO Pharma, a global healthcare company dedicated to helping people achieve healthy skin.  LEO Pharma has secured a unique position to help people with skin diseases as a result of our strategic partnership with AstraZeneca, a global healthcare company at the forefront of science-led innovation. By expanding our portfolio to include both biologics and topicals, LEO Pharma is set to become the world dermatology leader   offering the most diverse range of treatment solutions to meet the individual needs of people with skin diseases,  says Gitte Aabo, President and CEO, LEO Pharma. In the partnership with AstraZeneca, LEO Pharma acquires the global licence to tralokinumab in skin diseases and the exclusive licence to brodalumab in Europe. Tralokinumab is a potential new medicine, an anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody, that has completed a Phase IIb study for the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis. Brodalumab is an IL-17 receptor monoclonal antibody under regulatory review for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Under the terms of the agreement, LEO Pharma will make an upfront payment to AstraZeneca of $115 million for the exclusive, global rights to tralokinumab in atopic dermatitis and any future additional dermatology indications. LEO Pharma will also pay AstraZeneca up to $1 billion in commercially-related milestones and up to mid-teen tiered percentage royalties on Product Sales. AstraZeneca will manufacture and supply tralokinumab to LEO Pharma. AstraZeneca will retain all rights to tralokinumab in respiratory disease and any other indications outside of dermatology. Luke Miels, Executive Vice President, Global Product and Portfolio Strategy, AstraZeneca, said:  This agreement allows us to concentrate our efforts on tralokinumab s potential for patients with severe asthma, a priority area for AstraZeneca, while benefitting from LEO Pharma s expertise in dermatology for the continued development and commercialisation of tralokinumab in atopic dermatitis and other dermatology conditions.  Tralokinumab completed a Phase IIb trial in atopic dermatitis in Q1 2016. Top-line results from the trial showed that at week 12, a statistically significant improvement from baseline in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index) was observed in the two highest tralokinumab dosage arms tested compared to the placebo arm. Significant improvements in DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) were also observed.1 Brodalumab is supported by data from the three AMAGINE Phase III pivotal studies. The results highlight that brodalumab s mechanism of action delivers clinical benefit and could help a significant number of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients achieve total clearance of their skin disease2. Brodalumab has been submitted for regulatory approval in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in Europe and an EMA decision is anticipated no later than Q1 2017. The agreement with LEO Pharma for tralokinumab is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2016. The agreement for brodalumab became effective at signing and LEO Pharma s payments to AstraZeneca are not disclosed and are in line with the arrangement with the previous licence holder for Europe. Additionally, Amgen will continue to receive a low single-digit inventor royalty in relation to brodalumab.

Mircea Podar of ORNL s Biosciences Division led a team that isolated the archaeon Nanopusillus acidilobi, cultured these tiny microbes   just 100 to 300 billionths of a meter in size   and can now study how they interact with their host, another archaeon (Acidilobus). The relationships between these two organisms, detailed in a paper published in Nature Communications, can serve as a valuable model to study the evolution and mechanisms of more complex systems.  This work demonstrates how organisms find ways to adapt and interact with specific organisms in a symbiotic or parasitic way to survive in hostile environments,  Podar said.  By integrating knowledge from genomics, proteomics and classical microbiology, we can culture wild organisms and sometimes manipulate them for practical applications that range from energy production to medicine.  The Archaea domain consists of single-cell microorganisms that, like bacteria, have no cell nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, a sub-unit within a cell. These microbes have maintained an open environment-exposed cellular membrane, and Nanopusillus has developed a mechanism to acquire primary biosynthetic molecules from the host cell through cell-to-cell contact. With habitats like hot pools in Yellowstone, the Nanopusillus acidilobi microbe has been particularly elusive, so this accomplishment is likely to create a stir. One of the journal s reviewers noted that the discovery and paper provide  new exciting insights into the microbial diversity with important phylogenetic implications and thus represents a very important contribution in the archaeal/microbial diversity field.  Researchers also noted similarities between this microbe and its distant relative, the marine Nanoarchaeumm, which was cultured more than a decade ago. Through observations like this and by making comparisons over the years, scientists have been able to gain insight into structural and molecular properties of a host of novel groups of microbes. This most recent accomplishment is especially satisfying, said Podar, who noted that it was a combination of diligence and chance and took several years.  We discovered and cultured a novel organism from a group of organisms that people have been trying to get for over a decade, and in part that was due to prior genomic data we acquired from those organisms in Yellowstone,  Podar said, adding that the microbial system  abounds in unique, remarkable physiological and genomic features.

As drivers breathe into the device, a chemical sensor measures the amount of alcohol in their breath. This chemical reaction is then converted into an electronic signal, allowing the police officer to read off the result. Alcohol is easy to detect, because the chemical reaction is specific and the concentration of the measured gas is fairly high. But many other gases are complex mixtures of molecules in very low concentrations. Building electronic noses to detect them is thus quite a challenge. This is the most sensitive sensor ever created for pesticides and nerve gas. Researchers from KU Leuven have now built a very sensitive electronic nose with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  MOFs are like microscopic sponges,  postdoctoral researcher Ivo Stassen explains.  They can absorb quite a lot of gas into their minuscule pores.   We created a MOF that absorbs the phosphonates found in pesticides and nerve gases. This means you can use it to find traces of chemical weapons such as sarin or to identify the residue of pesticides on food. This MOF is the most sensitive gas sensor to date for these dangerous substances. Our measurements were conducted in cooperation with imec, the Leuven-based nanotechnology research centre. The concentrations we re dealing with are extremely low: parts per billion   a drop of water in an Olympic swimming pool   and parts per trillion. The chemical sensor can easily be integrated into existing electronic devices, Professor Rob Ameloot adds.  You can apply the MOF as a thin film over the surface of, for instance, an electric circuit. Therefore, it s fairly easy to equip a smartphone with a gas sensor for pesticides and nerve gas.   Further research will allow us to examine other applications as well,  Professor Ameloot continues.  MOFs can measure very low concentrations, so we could use them to screen someone s breath for diseases such as lung cancer and MS in an early stage. Or we could use the signature scent of a product to find out whether food has gone bad or to distinguish imitation wine from the original. This technology, in other words, offers a wide range of perspectives. ","Published: July 7, 2016"

Additionally, the agreement includes an exclusive option for Takeda to acquire Altos beginning on the date of the agreement and continuing for a period of time following the completion of ongoing Phase 1 studies of ATC-1906. The parties envision future development of ATC-1906 for the treatment of gastroparesis (GP) and its symptoms. GP is a chronic gastric motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms include early satiety, post-prandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. i Diabetic gastroparesis and idiopathic gastroparesis have high unmet need. Altos Therapeutics, a single asset company, is developing the ATC-1906 compound as an oral dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist that addresses the symptoms of nausea and vomiting in GP patients. As part of the agreement, Takeda will provide Altos an upfront payment for the option to acquire Altos. If Takeda elects to exercise the option, Takeda would make an additional payment to acquire Altos, and would then assume control over development and commercialization of ATC-1906. Altos would be eligible to receive additional payments linked to clinical development and achievement of key commercial milestones. No further details of the agreement were disclosed. In patients with GP, the activation of dopamine receptors drives an emetic response, also commonly known as vomiting. Altos & Takeda will seek to develop ATC-1906 and its dopamine receptor antagonist mechanism of action as an alternative treatment to target the symptoms of nausea and vomiting to relieve patient suffering with an improved safety profile.  There is a significant unmet need for a treatment to help patients with gastroparesis, and developing novel and innovative treatments for patients suffering from gastrointestinal disorders is a top priority for Takeda s global R&D strategy,  said Dr. Asit Parikh, senior vice president and head of Takeda s Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit.  This agreement reinforces Takeda s commitment to developing highly differentiated medicines to improve the health and quality of life of patients around the world.

HGGs, including glioblastoma, are the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumors and are treated initially with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, including temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar ). Response to TMZ treatment is variable and almost all tumors ultimately recur. Tumor sensitivity to TMZ correlates with the inactivation of MGMT and longer overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. Inactivation of MGMT is primarily caused by DNA methylation in the MGMT gene s control region. Given the prognostic and predictive value of MGMT methylation status, this test has become an informative tool in the management of glioblastoma. RiboMed has developed a new validated test, which improves the reliability and accuracy of MGMT testing. A full description and validation of this technology and comparison to other commonly used DNA methylation methods was recently published in Epigenomics (http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/epi-2016-0004).  Accurate diagnostics information is critical to help inform treatment decisions and expectations for outcomes,  said David Piccioni, M.D., Ph.D., neuro-oncologist at UC San Diego s Moores Cancer Center.  Having a test that can produce accurate and reliable MGMT promoter methylation data with minimal sample is an important advance for patients and their caregivers . Favorable safety and promising survival data from Tocagen s Phase 1, open-label, ascending dose, multicenter trial, that included analysis of epigenetic markers of tumors by RiboMed were published in the cover article of the June 2016 issue of Science Translational Medicine (http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/341/341ra75). Based on the positive results reported in this study, Tocagen is now conducting an international Phase 2/3 trial, Toca 5; more information can be found by searching www.clinicaltrials.gov using the clinical trial identifier NCT 02414165). In collaboration with RiboMed, the assay will be utilized to analyze MGMT status in tumors resected during the trial and evaluate association with potential treatment activity. The collaborative research also includes evaluation of RiboMed s GliomaSTRAT assay initially in tumor samples from earlier clinical trials. GliomaSTRAT is designed to stratify gliomas by both tumor aggressiveness and potential for drug activity. In addition to MGMT methylation, GliomaSTRAT includes a DNA methylation biomarker panel to determine the tumor s CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) and detection of the IDH1 R132H mutation known to cause CIMP. These prognostic biomarkers identify two distinct tumor subtypes that show significant differences in overall survival, independent of initial tumor grade classification. The ability to reliably analyze HGGs for multiple DNA methylation biomarkers, particularly with minimal material from FFPE tumor samples, has only recently become possible through the development of RiboMed s extremely sensitive detection method for measuring both DNA methylation and point mutations using its core technology, Abscription .","Published: July 7, 2016"

This is the finding of new research from scientists at Imperial College London and University of Washington, who analysed data from 183 countries collected between 1990 and 2013. Viral hepatitis exists in five forms   A, B, C, D and E and is transmitted through bodily fluids, or, in the case of A and E, through food or drink contaminated with faeces. A majority of the deaths   96 per cent - were due to hepatitis B and C which cause liver damage (cirrhosis), and liver cancer. Symptoms include fatigue, jaundice and nausea, however in many people the infection is symptomless - and so an individual may not know they are infected until they develop serious complications. The researchers, who published their findings in journal The Lancet, found that viral hepatitis deaths increased by 63 per cent over the 23-year period. The study, which was co-led by scientists at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, found deaths from viral hepatitis was were higher in high and middle-income countries than lower income countries. The authors say the overall disease burden is now more evenly divided between higher and lower income nations. The team say we now urgently need international measures to address this crisis. Dr Graham Cooke, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the research at Imperial said:  This is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the global burden of viral hepatitis. And it reveals startling findings   showing the death toll from this condition is now 1.45 million. Whereas deaths from many infectious diseases   such as TB and malaria - have dropped since 1990, viral hepatitis deaths have risen.  Dr Cooke added:  Although there are effective treatments and vaccines for viral hepatitis, there is very little money invested in getting these to patients  especially compared to malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB. We now have a viral hepatitis global action plan approved in May by the World Health Assembly, and we now need to implement it.  In the study, the team analysed data from the Global Burden of Disease study - an ongoing project that collects data from around the globe. The researchers assessed deaths from the four major viruses - A, B, C and E (hepatitis D only infects people already infected with hepatitis B). The researchers found deaths from acute infection, cirrhosis and liver disease caused by viral hepatitis had increased by 63 per cent from 890,000 in 1990 to 1.45 million in 2013. By comparison, in 2013, 1.3 million people worldwide died from AIDS, 1.4 million from TB, and 855,000 from malaria, according to a 2015 study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In the current study, most hepatitis deaths were found to occur in East Asia, and the majority of global deaths were due to hepatitis B and C. One potential reason for the high number of deaths from hepatitis B and C, explained Dr Cooke, is these strains cause long-term infections with very few immediate symptoms. They can therefore progress silently until they trigger serious liver damage or cancer. He added:  Although we have had an effective hepatitis B vaccine for some years, there is still a large proportion of the world which is unvaccinated. We have no similar vaccine for hepatitis C.  In addition to hepatitis-related deaths, the researchers estimated years of life lost. This is calculated by subtracting the age at death from the longest possible life expectancy for a person at that age. The team found that years of life lost in 2013 exceeded 41 million. Furthermore, there were more than 870,000 years in which people lived with disabilities related to hepatitis. Assistant Professor Jeff Stanaway, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, explained that viral hepatitis is unusual amongst leading communicable diseases because it is evenly divided between higher and lower income nations.  We explored the relationship between the burden of viral hepatitis and economic status. Viral hepatitis has consistently been ranked as a leading cause of mortality in upper-middle income countries, but a relative rise in mortality in lower-middle income countries has been associated with a narrowing in the rankings by 2013. Our results suggest that an evolution in funding structures is required to accommodate viral hepatitis and allow effective responses in low and low-to-middle middle income countries.  Dr Cooke added:  We have tools at our disposal to treat this disease   we have vaccines to hepatitis A and B, and we have new treatments to C. However the price of new medicines is beyond the reach of any country   rich or poor. This study will hopefully highlight that we should be doing more to make treatments for viral hepatitis affordable and accessible. ","Published: July 7, 2016"

This collaborative research project will identify genetic factors that may underlie breast cancer disparities. The effort is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The Breast Cancer Genetic Study in African-Ancestry Populations initiative does not involve new patient enrollment but builds on years of research cooperation among investigators who are part of the African-American Breast Cancer Consortium, the African-American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) Consortium, and the NCI Cohort Consortium. These investigators, who come from many different institutions, will share biospecimens, data, and resources from 18 previous studies, resulting in a study population of 20,000 black women with breast cancer.  This effort is about making sure that all Americans   no matter their background   reap the same benefits from the promising advances of precision medicine. The exciting new approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment ring hollow unless we can effectively narrow the gap of cancer disparities, and this new research initiative will help us do that,  said Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., acting director of NCI.  I m hopeful about where this new research can take us, not only in addressing the unique breast cancer profiles of African-American women, but also in learning more about the origin of cancer disparities.  Survival rates for women with breast cancer have been steadily improving over the past several decades. However, these improvements have not been shared equally; black women are more likely to die of their disease. Perhaps of most concern is that black women are more likely than white women to be diagnosed with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. The rate of triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype, is twice as high in black women as compared to white women. The exact reasons for these persistent disparities are unclear, although studies suggest that they are the result of a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and societal factors, including access to health care. Large studies are needed to comprehensively examine these factors, and NCI is supporting several such efforts. As part of the study, the genomes of 20,000 black women with breast cancer will be compared with those of 20,000 black women who do not have breast cancer. The genomes will also be compared to those of white women who have breast cancer. The project will investigate inherited genetic variations that are associated with breast cancer risk in black women compared to white women. In addition, researchers will examine gene expression in breast cancer tumor samples to investigate the genetic pathways that are involved in tumor development.  This $12 million grant   in combination with previous investments   should help advance our understanding of the social and biological causes that lead to disparities in cancer among underserved populations,  said Robert Croyle, Ph.D., director of NCI s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), which is administering the grant.  A better understanding of the genetic contributions to differences in breast cancer diagnoses and outcomes among African-Americans may lead to better treatments and better approaches to cancer prevention.   A number of studies have suggested that genetic factors may influence breast cancer disparities, so we re hopeful that this project can help to shed further light on this matter.  said Damali Martin, Ph.D., program director for the DCCPS Genomic Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Martin s office is working directly with the grant recipients as well as the consortia groups that have been researching black women and breast cancer. The grant has been awarded to Wei Zheng, M.D., Ph.D., of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennesee; Christopher Haiman, Sc.D., of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles; and Julie Palmer, Sc.D., of Boston University. Additionally, minority scientists from various institutions, including from one Historically Black College and University medical school, are playing an important role in this study, and they have been involved in previous research that this study builds upon. For example, the Southern Community Cohort Study, a contributing study for this grant, represents a 15-year partnership between Vanderbilt and historically black Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition, this grant will provide training opportunities for scientists from minority populations. Support for ongoing research in this area represents NCI s continued commitment to fund a comprehensive portfolio of research aimed at reducing cancer risk, incidence, and mortality, as well as improving quality of life for cancer survivors across all demographic groups. The National Cancer Institute leads the National Cancer Program and the NIH s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers.","Published: July 7, 2016"

The group's prior research showed that alcohol consumption alters the physical structure and function of neurons, called medium spiny neurons, in the dorsomedial striatum. Essentially, they found that activation of one type of neuron, called D1, determines whether one drink leads to two. Now, they've discovered the ones that tell us to stop. See Also: Alcohol exposure during pregnancy affects multiple generationsThese neurons can be thought of like a tree, with many branches, and many small protrusions, or spines, coming off of them. Each neuron has one of two types of dopamine receptors D1 or D2 and so can be thought of as either D1 or D2 neurons. D1 neurons are informally called part of a ""go"" pathway in the brain, while D2 neurons are in the ""no-go"" pathway. In other words, when D2 neurons are activated, they discourage action telling you to wait, to stop, to do nothing. ""At least from the addiction point of view, D2 neurons are good,"" said Jun Wang, MD, PhD, the corresponding author on the paper and assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics at the Texas A&M College of Medicine. ""When they are activated, they inhibit drinking behavior, and therefore activating them is important for preventing problem drinking behavior."" The trouble is, even in individuals without alcoholism, D2 neurons tend to become deactivated when we drink too much. This deactivation means there is nothing telling us to stop drinking, so we drink more, in a self-perpetuating cycle. Learn More: Mutation stops worms from getting drunk The researchers found that in animal models, repeated cycles of excessive alcohol intake, followed by abstaining from alcohol, actually changed the strength of these neuronal connections, making D2 signals less powerful--which results in essentially training the individual to seek alcohol. ""Think of the binge drinking behavior of so many young adults,"" Wang said. ""Essentially they are probably doing the same thing that we've shown leads to inhibition of these so-called 'good' neurons and contributes to greater alcohol consumption."" These findings provide insight into another mechanism underlying the complicated disease we call alcoholism. ""Our current and previous research are essentially two sides of the same coin,"" Wang said. ""D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons have essentially opposing roles in alcohol consumption."" By manipulating the activity of these neurons, the researchers were actually able to change the alcohol-drinking behavior of the animal models who had been ""trained"" to seek alcohol. By activating D2 neurons, they were able to decrease alcohol consumption, and the more the D2 neurons were activated, the greater the effect is likely to be. The research was supported in part by a grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Related: The genetics of alcoholism Although Wang cautions that we are still a long way from testing this in humans, in theory, if we could someday use drugs or electrical stimulation or some other method of activating the D2 neurons these so-called ""no-go"" neurons then we might be able to prevent alcoholics from wanting another drink. ""That's the ultimate goal,"" Wang said. ""I hope these findings will eventually be able to be used for treatment for alcohol addiction."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis provides clues to why some patients with glioblastoma fare worse and identifies a drug target that potentially could improve survival. The research shows that glioblastoma patients with a protein called oncostatin M receptor on their tumors face a particularly poor prognosis. Further, the findings suggest that treatments that target the receptor have the potential to halt progression of the especially aggressive tumor. The research is available online in Nature Neuroscience.  None of the treatments developed for glioblastoma over the past decades has been effective,  said senior co-corresponding author Azad Bonni, MD, PhD, the Edison Professor of Neuroscience and head of the Department of Neuroscience at Washington University.  We wanted to go back to the basic science and understand how these tumors arise so that we can identify new targets for potential therapy.  Tumors arise when cells accumulate mutations that allow them to escape normal constraints and start multiplying uncontrollably. The typical tumor cell carries mutations in multiple genes, and the effect of mutating one gene can depend on which other genes also are mutated in the cell. For example, earlier work by Bonni and colleagues at Harvard Medical School had shown that a protein called STAT3 protects against tumor formation, unless a mutated form of another protein, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is present. In such cases, STAT3 switches from protecting against tumor growth to actively promoting tumors. More than half of glioblastoma tumors contain mutations in the gene for EGFR or the sections of DNA that control how much EGFR is produced. Researchers reasoned that since mutated EGFR promotes tumor formation, inhibiting it should shrink tumors. Drugs that target EGFR, however, have had little effect on the survival of glioblastoma patients.  It looked like we were missing something in the EGFR-STAT3 pathway,  Bonni said.  If inhibiting EGFR didn t work, maybe it was because we needed to hit something else, too.  Using brain tumor stem cells derived from human tumors, Arezu Jahani-Asl, PhD   lead author of the study and an assistant professor at McGill University   and colleagues looked for other genes in the pathway. They found that the oncostatin M receptor, a protein associated with cell proliferation, was produced in cells that carried both STAT3 and the mutated form of EGFR. Furthermore, the receptor paired up with the mutated EGFR to trigger the production of even more of the receptor in a positive feedback loop.  Oncostatin M receptor started looking like an important target because it amplifies the EGFR pathway, which we already know is important in glioblastoma,  Bonni said.  But before going further, we asked,  Is this really relevant to human patients?  Two publicly available databases collect information about the molecules expressed on tumors from individual patients and how long those patients survived. In both datasets, the researchers found that the more oncostatin M receptor on the tumor, the sooner the patient died. The researchers then removed the receptor gene from human brain tumor stem cells and injected the modified cells into mice. The cells lacking the receptor formed tumors a fraction of the size of those formed by the same human brain tumor stem cell line with the receptor, indicating that the protein plays a key role in tumor formation, growth or both.  Being able to stop tumor formation entirely was a dramatic and shocking result,  said senior co-corresponding author Michael Rudnicki, PhD, a professor at the University of Ottawa.  It means that this protein is a key piece of the puzzle and could be a possible target for future treatments.  Scientists now are looking for drugs that can inhibit the receptor or block its interaction with EGFR. Such drugs potentially could lengthen survival times for glioblastoma patients.  It really gets down to personalized medicine,  Bonni said.  People whose tumors don t express the receptor wouldn t see an effect. But for people who overexpress the receptor, blocking it might really help. ","Published: July 6, 2016"

Scientists at the Salk Institute discovered that miR-19 guides the placement of new neurons in the adult brain, and the molecule is disrupted in cells from patients with schizophrenia. The findings published in the journal Neuron pave the way toward a better understanding of how the adult brain controls the growth of new neurons and how it can go wrong. See Also: MicroRNA could help diagnose and treat mental disorders  This is one of the first links between an individual microRNA and a specific process in the brain or a brain disorder,  says senior author Rusty Gage, professor in Salk s Laboratory of Genetics and holder of the Vi and John Adler Chair for Research on Age-Related Neurodegenerative Disease. While most RNA molecules contain the instructions for making proteins the physical workhorses of cells microRNAs don t encode proteins. Instead, they re active themselves, binding to other strands of RNA to block them from creating proteins. Previously, scientists have shown that levels of microRNA molecules are altered in brain disorders but not which microRNAs are responsible.  People have broadly studied microRNAs in the brain quite a bit,  says Jinju Han, a senior research associate at Salk and first author of the new paper.  But there are more than 2,000 microRNAs and only a few have been looked at in any depth.  In a few discrete areas of the human brain, new cells can emerge during adulthood. Gage, Han and their colleagues found that levels of miR-19 changed more than levels of any other microRNA when precursors to new brain cells in these areas (called neural progenitor cells) were coaxed to become neurons in the adult brain. Learn More: Powerful genetic regulator identified as risk factor for schizophrenia The microRNA miR-19 has been implicated in cancer and people never thought it was related to the brain,  says Han.  But we saw that its levels changed quite dramatically when stem cells differentiated into neurons.  The researchers went on to show that when miR-19 was blocked in neural progenitor cells, levels of RNA corresponding to a gene called Rapgef2 were altered. Moreover, new neurons did not migrate to the correct areas of the brain. Because the incorrect migration of new brain cells has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, Gage s group next analyzed the levels of miR-19 and Rapgef2 in neural progenitor cells that had been created by reprogramming skin cells from schizophrenic patients. Although the patients had no mutations in the gene for Rapgef2, they had high levels of miR-19 that corresponded with low levels of both the RNA and protein for Rapgef2. The team is now studying the role of miR-19 in mouse models of schizophrenia, as well as looking at cells from broader cohorts of human patients. Don't Miss: Important gene interaction that drives aggressive brain cancer defined Because miR-19 has been linked to cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer and B cell lymphoma researchers have already been working to develop drugs that block the molecule. But the new results, Han says, suggest that such drugs could have an effect on the brain.  This means that if miR-19 is being targeted in cancer, effects on the brain need to be carefully considered,  she says.  But it also means that people might use these therapies to treat neuropsychiatric disorders.  More work is needed, though, to see whether the results hold true in humans.

A new NASA-led study finds the geology of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is responsible. A NASA/NOAA/university team led by Son Nghiem of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, used satellite radar, sea surface temperature, land form and bathymetry (ocean depth) data to study the physical processes and properties affecting Antarctic sea ice. They found that two persistent geological factors -- the topography of Antarctica and the depth of the ocean surrounding it -- are influencing winds and ocean currents, respectively, to drive the formation and evolution of Antarctica's sea ice cover and help sustain it. ""Our study provides strong evidence that the behaviour of Antarctic sea ice is entirely consistent with the geophysical characteristics found in the southern polar region, which differ sharply from those present in the Arctic,"" said Nghiem. Antarctic sea ice cover is dominated by first-year (seasonal) sea ice. Each year, the sea ice reaches its maximum extent around the frozen continent in September and retreats to about 17 percent of that extent in February. Since the late 1970s, its extent has been relatively stable, increasing just slightly; however, regional differences are observed. Over the years, scientists have floated various hypotheses to explain the behaviour of Antarctic sea ice, particularly in light of observed global temperature increases. Are changes in the ozone hole involved? Could fresh meltwater from Antarctic ice shelves be making the ocean surface less salty and more conducive to ice formation, since salt inhibits freezing? Are increases in the strength of Antarctic winds causing the ice to thicken? Something is protecting Antarctic sea ice, but a definitive answer has remained elusive. To tackle this cryospheric conundrum, Nghiem and his team adopted a novel approach. They analyzed radar data from NASA's QuikScat satellite from 1999 to 2009 to trace the paths of Antarctic sea ice movements and map its different types. They focused on the 2008 growth season, a year of exceptional seasonal variability in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Their analyses revealed that as sea ice forms and builds up early in the sea ice growth season, it gets pushed offshore and northward by winds, forming a protective shield of older, thicker ice that circulates around the continent. The persistent winds, which flow downslope off the continent and are shaped by Antarctica's topography, pile ice up against the massive ice shield, enhancing its thickness. This band of ice, which varies in width from roughly 62 to 620 miles (100 to 1,000 kilometres), encapsulates and protects younger, thinner ice in the ice pack behind it from being reduced by winds and waves. The team also used QuikScat radar data to classify the different types of Antarctic sea ice. Older, thicker sea ice returns a stronger radar signal than younger, thinner ice does. They found the sea ice within the protective shield was older and rougher (due to longer exposure to wind and waves), and thicker (due to more ice growth and snow accumulation). As the sea ice cover expands and ice drifts away from the continent, areas of open water form behind it on the sea surface, creating ""ice factories"" conducive to rapid sea ice growth. To address the question of how the Southern Ocean maintains this great sea ice shield, the team combined sea surface temperature data from multiple satellites with a recently available bathymetric chart of the depth of the world's oceans. Sea surface temperature data reveal that at the peak of ice growth season, the boundary of the ice shield remains behind a 30-degree Fahrenheit (-1 degree Celsius) temperature line surrounding Antarctica. This temperature line corresponds with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, a boundary that separates the circulation of cold and warm waters around Antarctica. The team theorized that the location of this front follows the underwater bathymetry. When they plotted the bathymetric data against the ocean temperatures, the pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Pronounced seafloor features strongly guide the ocean current and correspond closely with observed regional Antarctic sea ice patterns. For example, the current stays near Bouvet Island, located 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) from the nearest land, where three tectonic plates join to form seafloor ridges. Off the coast of East Antarctica, the -1 degree Celsius sea surface temperature lines closely bundle together as they cross the Kerguelen Plateau (a submerged microcontinent that broke out of the ancient Gondwana supercontinent), through a deep channel called the Fawn Trough. But those lines spread apart over adjacent deep ocean basins, where seafloor features are not pronounced. Off the West Antarctica coast, the deep, smooth seafloor loses its grip over the current, allowing sea ice extent to decrease and resulting in large year-to-year variations.   Study results are published in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.

Wine possesses very subtle flavors and characteristics. But this is not happenstance. Producing wine is a complex undertaking. The fermentation process in particular plays a key role in how different flavors develop. Daniel Attinger is a professor at Iowa State University (USA) who has been invited to visit EPFL's Microsystems Laboratory. He is the inventor of a ""micro winery  on a chip, to help wine experts better understand and improve the fermentation process. The device, which an EPFL team will also work on, is capable of producing wine non-stop at the rate of one milliliter per hour. It will be used for testing fermentation processes. This innovative approach has already attracted the attention of schools like the Changins School in Switzerland, one of the top winemaking schools worldwide. Dealing with climate change The idea originated with Attinger, a former EPFL student from the Canton of Valais who is also a wine connoisseur.  Climate change is having an impact on the quality of grape crops around the world,  he said.  Due to the heat, some crops ripen too quickly, the harvest takes place sooner and the wines end up with a higher alcohol content or a different taste. We need to find ways to analyze and adapt how the wine is made.  Drawing on his expertise in multiphase microfluidics, Attinger came up with the idea of a micro-channel device that could quickly identify the best temperatures and yeasts for the fermentation process. Winemakers traditionally add yeast to barrels full of grape juice. The yeast absorbs sugar and releases alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process, referred to as alcoholic fermentation, takes between 7 and 21 days and requires a large volume of liquid. Hundreds of types of yeast, each one associated with different flavors, are commercially available. Selecting the best ones is a time-consuming process. Attinger s micro winery is designed to help wine experts and winemakers test different fermentation processes. It uses very small quantities of liquid and produces a result in less than an hour.  Let s say a winemaker in the Lavaux region of Switzerland finds that a certain type of yeast or a certain fermentation temperature leads to an overly bitter wine,  said Attinger.  We could quickly test alternatives.  Because his device is so small, the temperature can be increased or decreased very quickly. The device has a main channel through which the grape juice winds its way. The yeast is placed in adjacent compartments and feeds into the main channel through a very thin membrane with holes called nanopores. It s almost as if they were in little tea bags. When the grape juice reaches the yeasts, they absorb the sugar and give off alcohol and CO2 through the membrane. This process takes place very quickly, since the sugar and yeast are confined in such a small space. The use of compartments means that the fermentation process can be repeated very easily.  At a traditional winery, it takes weeks to separate the yeast from the wine, because they re mixed together. That s not a problem here,  said Attinger. The role of the EPFL researchers is to monitor the behavior of the yeast in the bioreactors.  We  screen  the yeast, which consists of analyzing what the yeast produces as a function of the conditions that we determine,  said Philippe Renaud, the head of EPFL s Microsystems Laboratory. A future project for PhD students Industry professionals are keenly interested in this miniature wine-making device.  It s great,  said Ram n Mira de Ordu a Heidinger, a professor of wine chemistry at the Changins school of viticulture and enology.  We will be able to use it to characterize different types of yeast and study their resistance to sulfites and production of acetic acid.  Will wine lovers be able to use the device to whip up a batch of wine at home in just a few hours?  Why not?  said Renaud with a smile.  But that s more of a gimmick. It uses a simplified process and the result is currently not as good as normal wine.  The partners will continue collaborating on the project, with some working at EPFL and others in the United States.  It s a very good topic of study for PhD students: there's a fun side to it, but it also addresses a lot of fundamental concepts,  said Renaud, whose parents were winemakers.  Pharmaceutical companies are also interested in this type of process, and by the same type of yeast, in order to produce certain substances. So the real-world applications are actually much broader.  Daniel Attinger s team in the United States includes a professor in electrical engineering, an enologist, and a PhD student who specializes in microfabrication.","Published: July 6, 2016"

Now, research by Andrew West, Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of Alabama at Birmingham has revealed that the tubes hold a brand-new type of biomarker   a phosphorylated protein that correlates with the presence and severity of Parkinson s disease. West and colleagues, with support from the National Institutes of Health, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Disease Research and the Parkinson s Disease Foundation, are digging deeper into these biobanked samples, to validate the biomarker as a possible guide for future clinical treatments and a monitor of the efficacy of potential new Parkinson s drugs in real time during treatment.  Nobody thought we d be able to measure the activity of this huge protein called LRRK2 (pronounced lark two) in biofluids since it is usually found inside neurons in the brain,  said West, co-director of the Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics, and the John A. and Ruth R. Jurenko Professor of Neurology at UAB.  New biochemical markers like the one we ve discovered together with new neuroimaging approaches are going to be the key to successfully stopping Parkinson s disease in its tracks. I think the days of blindly testing new therapies for complex diseases like Parkinson s without having active feedback both for  on-target  drug effects and for effectiveness in patients are thankfully coming to an end.  A biomarker helps physicians predict, diagnose or monitor disease, because the biomarker corresponds to the presence or risk of disease, and its levels may change as the disease progresses. Validated biomarkers can aid both preclinical trial work in the laboratory and future clinical trials of drugs to treat Parkinson s. West and others are paving the way for an inhibitor drug that prevented neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in an animal model of the disease, as reported last year by West and colleagues. The new biomarker findings were published in Neurology in March and Movement Disorders in June. The biomarker, LRRK2, has been shown to play a role in hereditary Parkinson s, and the most common of these mutations   called G2019S   causes the LRRK2 kinase to add too many phosphates to itself and other proteins. Why this leads to Parkinson s disease is not yet clear. The key to West s biomarker approach was the recognition that LRRK2 can be purified from a new type of vesicle called exosomes found in all human biofluids, like urine and saliva. Cells in the body continually release exosomes that contain a mixture of proteins, RNA and DNA derived from different kinds of cells. West and colleagues were able to purify exosomes from 3- or 4-ounce urine samples donated by patients, and then measure phosphorylated LRRK2 in those exosomes. The findings In the Neurology study, they found that elevated phosphorylated LRRK2 predicted the risk for onset of Parkinson s disease for people carrying a mutation in LRRK2, which is about 2-3 percent of all Parkinson s disease patients. These findings were first tested with a preliminary, 14-person cohort of urine samples from the Columbia University Movement Disorders Center. That was followed by a larger replication study of 72 biobanked urine samples from the Michael J. Fox Foundation LRRK2 Cohort Consortium. All samples were provided to UAB in a blinded fashion to ensure the approach was rigorous. The follow-up Movement Disorders paper   the first study of its type   expanded the scope to people without LRRK2 mutations, which is most Parkinson s disease patients. Using 158 urine samples from Parkinson s disease patients and healthy controls enrolled in the UAB Movement Disorder Clinic as part of the NIH Parkinson s Disease Biomarker Program, West and colleagues found that approximately 20 percent of people without LRRK2 mutations but with Parkinson s disease also showed highly elevated phosphorylated LRRK2 similar to people with LRRK2 mutations, and this was not present in healthy controls. The study speculates that people with elevated phosphorylated LRRK2 may be particularly good candidates for future drugs that reduce phosphorylated LRRK2. Next steps Questions remain for this evidence of biochemical changes in LRRK2 in idiopathic Parkinson s disease. One is finding out where the urinary exosomes come from. Given a suspected role for inflammation in Parkinson s disease, it is interesting that LRRK2 is highly expressed in cells of the innate immune system. A possible explanation for the phosphorylated LRRK2 in patients with more severe disease may be an increased inflammation in those patients who have aggressive progression of disease. In May, West was awarded a new U01 collaborative grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to further explore urinary exosomes and extend the observations to cerebral-spinal fluid as a marker for disease prediction and prognosis.

Now, a new study in mice has shown that immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer can be effective when given in conjunction with drugs that break up the fibrous tissue in these tumors. The study, from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, appears July 4 in Nature Medicine. Based on the study s findings, doctors at Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital are conducting a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that will test the safety of this drug combination when given along with standard chemotherapy.  Pancreatic tumors are notoriously unresponsive to both conventional chemotherapy and newer forms of immunotherapeutics,  said senior author David G. DeNardo, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine.  We suspect that the fibrous environment of the tumor that is typical of pancreatic cancer may be responsible for the poor response to immune therapies that have been effective in other types of cancer.  Unlike other cancer types, pancreatic tumors are characterized by a large amount of what DeNardo describes as scar tissue. This extra connective tissue and the cells that deposit it provide a protective environment for cancer cells, stopping the immune system from attacking the tumor cells and limiting the cancer s exposure to chemotherapy delivered through the bloodstream. DeNardo and his colleagues investigated whether some of this protection might be lost if they could disrupt the proteins that help fibrous tissue adhere to itself and surrounding cells.  Proteins called focal adhesion kinases are known to be involved in the formation of fibrous tissue in many diseases, not just cancer,  DeNardo said.  So we hypothesized that blocking this pathway might diminish fibrosis and immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer.  Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors have been developed in other areas of cancer research, but DeNardo and his colleagues, including oncologist Andrea Wang-Gillam, MD, PhD, an associate professor of medicine, are the first to test them against pancreatic cancer in conjunction with immunotherapy. In the mouse study, an investigational FAK inhibitor was given in combination with a clinically approved immune therapy that activates the body s T cells and makes tumor cells more vulnerable to attack. Mice with a model of pancreatic cancer survived no longer than two months when given either a FAK inhibitor or immune therapy alone. Adding FAK inhibitors to standard chemotherapy improved tumor response over chemotherapy alone. But the three-drug combination   FAK inhibitors, immune therapy and chemotherapy   showed the best outcomes in laboratory studies, more than tripling survival times in some mice. Some were still alive without evidence of progressing disease at six months and beyond. The success of this mouse study provided a strong rationale for testing this drug combination in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, according to Wang-Gillam.  This trial is one of about a dozen we are conducting specifically for pancreatic cancer at Washington University,  she said.  We hope to improve outcomes for these patients, especially since survival with metastatic pancreatic cancer is typically only six months to a year. The advantage of our three-pronged approach is that we are attacking the cancer in multiple ways, breaking up the fibers of the tumor microenvironment so that more immune cells and more of the chemotherapy drug can attack the tumor.

According to Shin-ichiro Fujii, leader of the Laboratory for Immunotherapy, who led the study,  Cancer cells have different sensitivities to the innate or adaptive response, so it important to target both in order to eradicate it. We have developed a special type of modified cell, called aAVC, which we found can do this.  The aAVC cells are not taken from the subject s own body but are foreign cells. The cells are modified by adding a natural killer t-cell ligand, which permits them to stimulate natural killer T-cells, along with an antigen associated with a cancer. The group found that when these cells are activated, they in turn promote the maturation of dendritic cells, which act as coordinators of the innate and acquired response. Dendritic cells are key because they allow the activation of immune memory, where the body remembers and responds to a threat even years later.  To find whether it worked in actual bodies, they conducted experiments in mice with a virulent form of melanoma that also expresses a model antigen called OVA. Tests in mice showed, moreover, that aggressive tumors could be shrunken by vaccinating the animals with aAVC cells that were programmed to display OVA antigen. Following the treatment, the tumors in the treated animals were smaller and necrotic in the interior a sign that the tumor was being attacked by the killer CD8+T-cells.  Fujii continues,  We were interesting in finding a mechanism, and were able to understand that the aAVC treatment led to the development of blood vessels in the tumors that expressed a pair of important adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, that are not normally expressed in tumors. This allowed the killer CD8+T cells to penetrate into the tumor.  They also found that in animals that had undergone the treatment, cancer cells injected even a year later were eliminated.  This indicates,  says Fujii,  that we have successfully created an immune memory that remembers the tumor and attacks it even later.  Looking to the future, Fujii says,  Our therapy with aAVC is promising because typical immunotherapies have to be tailor-made with the patient s own cells. In our case we use foreign cells, so they can be made with a stable quality. Because we found that our treatment can lead to the maturation of dendritic cells, immunotherapy can move to local treatment to more systemic treatment based on immune memory.

MIT engineers have now developed a way to visualize these molecules in higher resolution than previously possible in intact tissues, allowing researchers to precisely map the location of RNA throughout cells. Key to the new technique is expanding the tissue before imaging it. By making the sample physically larger, it can be imaged with very high resolution using ordinary microscopes commonly found in research labs.  Now we can image RNA with great spatial precision, thanks to the expansion process, and we also can do it more easily in large intact tissues,  says Ed Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, a member of MIT s Media Lab and McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of a paper describing the technique in the July 4 issue of Nature Methods. Studying the distribution of RNA inside cells could help scientists learn more about how cells control their gene expression and could also allow them to investigate diseases thought to be caused by failure of RNA to move to the correct location. Boyden and colleagues first described the underlying technique, known as expansion microscopy (ExM), last year, when they used it to image proteins inside large samples of brain tissue. In a paper appearing in Nature Biotechnology on July 4, the MIT team has now presented a new version of the technology that employs off-the-shelf chemicals, making it easier for researchers to use. MIT graduate students Fei Chen and Asmamaw Wassie are the lead authors of the Nature Methods paper, and Chen and graduate student Paul Tillberg are the lead authors of the Nature Biotechnology paper. A simpler process The original expansion microscopy technique is based on embedding tissue samples in a polymer that swells when water is added. This tissue enlargement allows researchers to obtain images with a resolution of around 70 nanometres, which was previously possible only with very specialized and expensive microscopes. However, that method posed some challenges because it requires generating a complicated chemical tag consisting of an antibody that targets a specific protein, linked to both a fluorescent dye and a chemical anchor that attaches the whole complex to a highly absorbent polymer known as polyacrylate. Once the targets are labelled, the researchers break down the proteins that hold the tissue sample together, allowing it to expand uniformly as the polyacrylate gel swells. In their new studies, to eliminate the need for custom-designed labels, the researchers used a different molecule to anchor the targets to the gel before digestion. This molecule, which the researchers dubbed AcX, is commercially available and therefore makes the process much simpler. AcX can be modified to anchor either proteins or RNA to the gel. In the Nature Biotechnology study, the researchers used it to anchor proteins, and they also showed that the technique works on tissue that has been previously labeled with either fluorescent antibodies or proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP).  This lets you use completely off-the-shelf parts, which means that it can integrate very easily into existing workflows,  Tillberg says.  We think that it s going to lower the barrier significantly for people to use the technique compared to the original ExM.  Using this approach, it takes about an hour to scan a piece of tissue 500 by 500 by 200 microns, using a light sheet fluorescence microscope. The researchers showed that this technique works for many types of tissues, including brain, pancreas, lung, and spleen. Imaging RNA In the Nature Methods paper, the researchers used the same kind of anchoring molecule but modified it to target RNA instead. All of the RNAs in the sample are anchored to the gel, so they stay in their original locations throughout the digestion and expansion process. After the tissue is expanded, the researchers label specific RNA molecules using a process known as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which was originally developed in the early 1980s and is widely used. This allows researchers to visualize the location of specific RNA molecules at high resolution, in three dimensions, in large tissue samples. This enhanced spatial precision could allow scientists to explore many questions about how RNA contributes to cellular function. For example, a longstanding question in neuroscience is how neurons rapidly change the strength of their connections to store new memories or skills. One hypothesis is that RNA molecules encoding proteins necessary for plasticity are stored in cell compartments close to the synapses, poised to be translated into proteins when needed. With the new system, it should be possible to determine exactly which RNA molecules are located near the synapses, waiting to be translated.  People have found hundreds of these locally translated RNAs, but it s hard to know where exactly they are and what they re doing,  Chen says.  This technique would be useful to study that.  Boyden s lab is also interested in using this technology to trace the connections between neurons and to classify different subtypes of neurons based on which genes they are expressing. The research was funded by the Open Philanthropy Project, the New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Award, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and Jeremy and Joyce Wertheimer.","Published: July 6, 2016"

These infections worsen patient health and limit life-expectancy. Over the years of the infection, the bacteria evolve to become better adapted to the lung environment, becoming very difficult to treat. Tracking evolutionary change A team of scientists from the Universities of Liverpool, Salford and York evolved populations of the bacterium P. aeruginosa with or without bacteriophages in a growth medium designed to replicate the sputum in CF lungs. They then tracked evolutionary change in the bacterium using genome sequencing. The study reports that bacteria with bacteriophages evolved faster to adapt to life in sputum. This happened because the bacteriophage jumped into the bacterium s DNA, increasing the number of useful mutations that natural selection could use. Many of the mutations seen in the lab-evolved bacteria, including those caused by the bacteriophage, are also commonly seen in bacteria isolated from CF infections. Because bacteriophages live wherever you find bacteria, including in the lungs of CF patients, this could mean that bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution in the clinic. Antibiotic threat Dr Chloe James, lecturer in Medical Microbiology at the University of Salford, said:  We knew from our previous work that the bacteriophages infecting P. aeruginosa were commonly found in CF patient sputum. We now know that these bacteriophages can speed up evolution helping bacteria adapt to living in a sputum-like environment  Professor Craig Winstanley, from the University of Liverpool s Institute of Infection and Global Health, said:  Because some antibiotics can activate bacteriophages, some antibiotic therapies might help bacteria to adapt to the lung faster making the infections even more difficult to treat.  Professor Michael Brockhurst, of the University of York, added:  To design better treatments and preserve our antibiotics we urgently need to better understand how bacteria evolve in infections. These new results suggest that bacteriophages may play a much bigger role than previously thought, by turbo-charging evolutionary adaptation. ","Published: July 6, 2016"

Yet genomic studies in mice have lagged behind those in humans.  Genome-wide association studies   matching genes to diseases and other traits   have been a big deal in human genetics for the past decade,  said Abraham Palmer, PhD, professor of psychiatry at University of California San Diego School of Medicine.  But progress hasn t been so great in animal genetics. That s because researchers have mostly been using crosses between inbred strains, making it impossible to pinpoint specific genomic regions or individual genes associated with a trait. In addition, we didn t previously have good ways of genotyping animals in a cost-efficient way.  Now, in a study published July 4 in Nature Genetics, Palmer s team used 1,200 outbred mice, which are more similar to a natural population, to test a new cost-effective technique to search for specific genes linked with 66 different physical and behavioral traits.  This is a system that could be used to discover genes associated with any complex trait a researcher is interested in, in any animal model,  Palmer said.  We can look at any trait and rapidly develop hypotheses about specific genes. It s like genome-wide association studies in humans, but less expensive. And we can look at certain traits that we can t in humans.  Previously, only large regions of a chromosome could be associated with a particular mouse trait or behavior. Palmer s method takes advantage of the superior mixing that is present in an outbred population to help drill down to specific genes using two steps: genotype-by-sequencing, which sequences about one percent of the mouse genome; and RNA sequencing, which identifies only genes turned  on  in a particular tissue, such as the brain. With this approach, the researchers found numerous associations between genes and the traits they are associated with. For example, they report that the mouse gene Azi2 is associated with the effects methamphetamines have on body movements, and that mouse gene Zmynd11 is associated with anxiety-like behavior. The findings may be clinically relevant, as humans have analogous genes, Palmer said. Next, the team will engineer mice that specifically lack these genes to determine if the associations are truly causal and to better understand the underlying mechanisms.  This study has been extremely gratifying since this is the first time these two genes have been identified as playing roles in psychological conditions,  Palmer said.  And now we can think about targeting these genes or the proteins they encode with novel therapeutics. ","Published: July 6, 2016"

The study was performed by scientists from University Medical Centre Groningen, Radboud University Medical Centre (both in the Netherlands) and Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA).  We all encounter pathogens on a daily basis, but we don t all defend ourselves against bacteria or fungi, for example, in the same way. Some people experience mild symptoms, others may become violently ill or even die.  We wanted to discover how much individual genetic differences determine this variable response , said Dr. Vinod Kumar, assistant professor of functional genomics and infectious diseases at University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) and one of the senior authors of the paper. The study focused on the role of cytokines, small peptides used by immune cells as signals to guide their response to an infectious agent. Blood samples were obtained from 200 participants in the Human Functional Genomics Project, which was initiated by Professors Mihai Netea and Leo Joosten (Radboud UMC) and Prof. Cisca Wijmenga (UMCG). Immune cells were isolated from the blood and stimulated in the laboratory with ten different bacterial and fungal pathogens. The responses of eight different cytokines were measured after 24 hours and/or 7 days. Further quality filtering resulted in 62 different combinations.  We observed large differences in cytokine production between individuals , explained Kumar.  Their responses were also specific to the different pathogens . This suggests that cytokines contribute to the varied responses to pathogens, and that each infection triggers a specific cytokine response pathway. Previous studies on unstimulated immune cells had shown little variation between individuals. Dr. Yang Li, another author on the study, explained:  The key to our results is that we performed a large-scale study, using many pathogens and measuring different cytokines . The next step was to investigate if the responses were under genetic control. In a subset of participants, they tested 4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This pinpointed six genomic regions that influence cytokine responses, suggesting that cytokine production is at least partly genetically determined. One of the strongest examples is a SNP that affects the expression of the GOLM1 gene, which is known to express strongly in response to viral infections. In this case, there was a strong correlation with the response to the fungus Candida albicans, which is responsible for thousands of deaths each year.  When a particular variant of the SNP was present, the production of the cytokine interleukin-6 was reduced , said Kumar. The result was verified in a cohort of patients with candidemia, in which the fungus is present in the blood. The candidemia correlated strongly with the same SNP and with low levels of interleukin-6 in these patients, showing that the presence of the genetic variant results in an inability to clear the pathogen.  This study is a real proof-of-concept , says Li.  We found a lot of variation in cytokine production upon stimulation, and showed that an important part of this variation is explained by a genetic component . This opens the way for more applied studies that move towards personalized medicine. It might well be possible to find genetic markers that will predict the risk of infection in individuals. An understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying these different susceptibilities could lead to new therapeutic approaches.  And it s not just for infections , said Kumar:  Autoimmune diseases, for example inflammatory bowel disease, appear to be caused by an over-responsive immune system. So this work means we can learn more about the way infections trigger autoimmune diseases. ","Published: July 6, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/breathing-in-a-cure-189243,Breathing in a Cure Researchers working on inhalable ibuprofen to treat cystic fibrosis  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Ibuprofen: You can buy it at any drug store, and it will help with that stabbing headache or sprained ankle. One of the ways it does so is by reducing inflammation, and it is this property that may also help patients with cystic fibrosis. Research has found that ibuprofen, when taken at high doses, helps slow the progression of lung function decline in people with cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by having two  bad  copies of a gene that codes for a protein important in fluid secretion. Improved lung function is important, given that most people diagnosed die by their early 50s, usually due to chronic lung infections caused by their inability to move particles, including bacteria, up and out of the lungs. The downside is that ibuprofen doses that high, when taken routinely, can result in gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and when combined with the antibiotics that these patients often have to take for their recurring lung infections acute kidney injury. But what if you could get the drug just to the area that needs it: the lungs? You could harness ibuprofen s benefits without the negative side effects. Carolyn Cannon, MD, PhD, an associate professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine, is working on a way to do just that.  We feel that nanoparticle ibuprofen delivered by aerosol to the lungs would be a fantastic therapeutic,  Cannon said. And because it is essentially a repurposed drug only the delivery method is different the development and regulatory approval process should be relatively easy, in comparison to the requirements for a novel therapeutic.  The researchers who performed the original ibuprofen study thought it was working solely by inhibiting the migration of a type of white blood cell, called the neutrophil, to the lung. It goes hand-in-hand with acute inflammation,  Cannon said.  However, although this may be one mechanism of action, at the high doses that were being given to the cystic fibrosis patients, the drug also has antimicrobial properties.  The inhaled ibuprofen would work in conjunction with the antibiotics the patient is already being given for the underlying infection.  We determined that not only does ibuprofen act as an antimicrobial itself, it is also synergistic with the antibiotics we already give to these patients,  Cannon said.  Together, they kill the pathogens much better than either one does alone and we could get the same great effects of the high concentrations of ibuprofen without the side effects.  Cannon and her team are pursuing international patent protection on this technology and, in the next year or so, hope to begin discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about working towards receiving Investigational New Drug (IND) status to allow for future clinical trials.","Published: July 6, 2016"

Illumina s attempts to have the defence dismissed were refused. The Court also ordered Illumina to provide an unredacted copy of a Pooled Patents Agreement to the Company s legal advisers, which Illumina had previously refused.  The PPA was entered into by Illumina and Sequenom in late 2014 and is the basis for the patent litigation claims made by the Claimants against the Company in the UK and against its customers in Poland and Switzerland, along with similar litigation against other competitors that do not use Illumina sequencing platforms for their NIPT solutions.  In its reasoning, the Court stated that disclosure of the PPA will very probably  shed some light on the competition arguments that are being raised . During the CMC, Premaitha disclosed to the Court that it had been contacted by the Commission in relation to an investigation it opened into potentially anticompetitive conduct by Illumina and Sequenom.  Premaitha understands that the Commission is investigating whether the background to - and creation of - the PPA, and the Claimants  behaviour since then, infringes Articles 101 and/or 102 TFEU. The Company understands that the Commission is also examining whether the licensing practices of Illumina (the dominant supplier of DNA Sequencing hardware) raise competition law concerns. In a connected development, Premaitha announces that it has formally intervened in the defence in the previously announced Polish patent infringement action by the Claimants against its Polish customer, to ensure consistency of defence against the multinational Claimants. Stephen Little, CEO, commented:  We are very pleased that the EU Competition Commission will be looking closely at Illumina s and Sequenom s conduct in the NIPT sector, and that the English Court will consider the alleged anti-competitive conduct if necessary after the patent hearings, now scheduled for July 2017. We brought this conduct to their attention and will actively cooperate with these investigations to shine a light on what we believe is a pernicious strategy to buy up intellectual property in the sector, and then to use this combined patent pool and aggressive legal actions to stop developers of alternative genetic/sequencing technology, thereby suppressing competition and ultimately restricting patient choice.   We understand that if Illumina and/or Sequenom have infringed the EU competition rules, then the Commission has the power to impose far-reaching licensing remedies, as well as to impose significant fines against these companies (up to 10 per cent of each company s worldwide group turnover). We hope, therefore, that the Commission s investigation will urgently cause Illumina and Sequenom to reconsider and modify their current practices to address the very serious concerns that have been raised, including amending the infringing provisions of the Pooled Patents Agreement and ending their discriminatory licensing practices.  The English Courts also have the authority to impose licences on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis for any patent claims deemed to be infringed by Premaitha, which we continue to deny. The conduct of Illumina and Sequenom is denying women s choice and access to high quality localised NIPT screening. Premaitha continues to strongly oppose such conduct and to deliver leading NIPT solutions to an increasingly international population of pregnant women through our customers and partners, which include the NHS and other public and private healthcare providers.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/programmable-rna-vaccines-206021,Programmable RNA Vaccines Tests in mice show the vaccines work against Ebola  influenza  and a common parasite  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.MIT engineers have developed a new type of easily customizable vaccine that can be manufactured in one week, allowing it to be rapidly deployed in response to disease outbreaks. So far, they have designed vaccines against Ebola, H1N1 influenza, and Toxoplasma gondii (a relative of the parasite that causes malaria), which were 100 percent effective in tests in mice. The vaccine consists of strands of genetic material known as messenger RNA, which can be designed to code for any viral, bacterial, or parasitic protein. These molecules are then packaged into a molecule that delivers the RNA into cells, where it is translated into proteins that provoke an immune response from the host. In addition to targeting infectious diseases, the researchers are using this approach to create cancer vaccines that would teach the immune system to recognize and destroy tumors.  This nanoformulation approach allows us to make vaccines against new diseases in only seven days, allowing the potential to deal with sudden outbreaks or make rapid modifications and improvements,  says Daniel Anderson, an associate professor in MIT s Department of Chemical Engineering and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). Anderson is the senior author of a paper describing the new vaccines in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of July 4. The project was led by Jasdave Chahal, a postdoc at MIT s Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and Omar Khan, a postdoc at the Koch Institute; both are the first authors of the paper. Customizable vaccines Most traditional vaccines consist of an inactivated form of a virus or other pathogen. These vaccines usually take a long time to manufacture, and for some diseases they are too risky. Other vaccines consist of proteins normally produced by the microbe, but these don t always induce a strong immune response, requiring researchers to seek an adjuvant (a chemical that enhances the response). RNA vaccines are appealing because they induce host cells to produce many copies of the proteins they encode, which provokes a stronger immune reaction than if the proteins were given on their own. The idea of using messenger RNA molecules as vaccines has been around for about 30 years, but one of the major obstacles has been finding a safe and effective way to deliver them. Khan decided to package RNA vaccines into a nanoparticle made from a branched molecule known as a dendrimer. One key advantage of this material is that the researchers can give it a temporary positive charge, which allows it to form close associations with RNA, which is negatively charged. Khan can also control the size and pattern of the final structure. By inducing the dendrimer-RNA structure to fold over itself many times, Khan generated spherical vaccine particles with a diameter of about 150 nanometers. That makes them of similar size as many viruses, enabling the particles to enter cells by exploiting the same surface proteins that viruses use for this purpose. By customizing the RNA sequences, the researchers can design vaccines that produce nearly any protein they want. The RNA molecules also include instructions for amplification of the RNA, so that the cell will produce even more of the protein. The vaccine is designed to be delivered by intramuscular injection, making it easy to administer. Once the particles get into cells, the RNA is translated into proteins that are released and stimulate the immune system. Significantly, the vaccines were able to stimulate both arms of the immune system   a T cell response and an antibody response. In tests in mice, animals that received a single dose of one of the vaccines showed no symptoms following exposure to the real pathogen   Ebola, H1N1 influenza, or Toxoplasma gondii.  No matter what antigen we picked, we were able to drive the full antibody and T cell responses,  Khan says. The researchers also believe that their vaccines would be safer than DNA vaccines, another alternative that scientists are pursuing, because unlike DNA, RNA cannot be integrated into the host genome and cause mutations.  The option of rapidly creating a completely synthetic formulation that can be effective as a vaccine is an important addition to currently available vaccine strategies,  says Hidde Ploegh, an MIT professor of biology, a member of the Whitehead Institute, and an author of the paper, who added that it will be important to assess safety and cost. Rapid deployment The ability to rapidly design and manufacture these vaccines could be especially beneficial for fighting influenza, because the most common flu vaccine manufacturing method, which requires the viruses to be grown inside chicken eggs, takes months. This means that when an unexpected flu strain appears, such as the 2009 pandemic-causing H1N1 virus, there is no way to rapidly produce a vaccine against it.  Typically a vaccine becomes available long after the outbreak is over,  Chahal says.  We think we can become interventional over the course of a real outbreak.  Joseph Rosen, a professor of surgery at Dartmouth College s Geisel School of Medicine and adjunct professor of engineering at Dartmouth s Thayer School of Engineering, describes the new approach to vaccine development as  revolutionary,  because it could dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to respond to disease outbreak.  This could not only be applicable to the bugs they talked about, but could also be applicable for something even more important, which is an unknown virus,  says Rosen, who was not involved in the research.  In response to a pandemic, whether natural, accidental, or intentional, they could produce a vaccine in a week.  Khan and Chahal plan to start a company to license and commercialize the technology. In addition to the vaccines they have already designed, they hope to create vaccines for Zika virus and Lyme disease. They are also working on cancer vaccines. At a recent  Mission: Possible  competition hosted by the Koch Institute, Khan and Chahal were part of a team that ended up withdrawing from the competition because an outside funder, the Advanced Medical Research Foundation, offered to support them. For that project, the researchers designed vaccines that target genes that are normally turned on only during embryonic development. These genes, dormant in adults, often become reactivated in a type of cancer known as non-small cell lung tumors.  We are all excited about the potential of this new approach to provide a new way of vaccine delivery,  says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and an author of the paper.","Published: July 6, 2016"

Our work focuses on  causality-like  relationships among several genes and their mutations that drive the cancer progression as the tumor environment reacts to changes, such as lack of oxygen, cell mobility, or immune response,  explains New York University Professor Bud Mishra, one of the study s co-authors.  It then uses the model to predict how a tumor s genomes will change over time.   We are proposing a bioinformatics protocol to detect common  regularities  in tumors  origin and development,  adds co-author Giulio Caravagna, a research associate at the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation of the University of Edinburgh.  This might be a key step to understanding a disease characterized by a few common genomic lesions in different patients.  In their study, which appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers focused on colorectal cancer, taking into account relatively recent developments in our understanding of the disease. Previously, cancer was thought to start with one  renegade cell  and spread, in part, through a combination of cell-autonomous genetic interactions: mutations in oncogenes, which have the potential to cause cancer, and the failure of tumor suppressor genes to control them. However, in recent years, the availability of advanced genomics sequencing has revealed a more complex picture of cancer growth. Specifically, the interaction between cells in a tumor population appears to be more relevant than previously understood, as tumors have been shown to be more heterogeneous in their cellular makeup than once thought. The research team on the PNAS study, which involved collaborations with the Catalan Institute of Oncology-IDIBELL and University of Barcelona (Victor Moreno s lab) and the University of Milan-Bicocca (Marco Antoniotti and Giancarlo Mauri s lab), sought to capture these interactions through a model that would create a cellular picture of the spread of colorectal cancer. To do so, they developed a modeling system, Pipeline for Cancer Inference, or PiCnIc, that employs gene sequencing data to make predictions about causality: what are the conditions that will  cause  tumors to grow? PiCnIC, in particular, takes into account the function of  driver  mutations that spur cancer progression as well as other phenomena, such as how one driver mutation relates to another driver over time. To test the viability of their model, the researchers compared its predictions with existing knowledge on the nature of the growth of colorectal cancer. Their results showed that PiCnIC was effectively able to capture what current medical research knows about the growth of the disease: its forecast closely tracked what has been scientifically documented. Mishra s lab at NYU aims to combine these results with its work on other technologies and phenomena related to cancer and therapy design: improved studies using single molecules or cancer image analysis, as shown, for example, in a recent PLoS One paper on how oxygen deficiencies vary over a tumor. The research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (CCF-0836649, CCF-0926166), an NCI-PSOC (U54 CA193313) grant, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, which is supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (PI11-01439, PIE13/00022), the Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC) Scientific Foundation, and a Catalan Government DURSI grant (2014SGR647).","Published: July 6, 2016"

The system produces 1.3  W of power and 52.25  A of current yielding a power density of approximately 25 W/m3 for this experiment. These results show that the paper-based microbial fuel cells can create power in an environmentally friendly mode without the use of any outside power. ""All power created in this device is useable because no electricity is needed to run the fluids through the device. This is crucial in the advancement of these devices and the expansion of their applications."" says Nastaran Hashemi, PhD, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and the senior author of the paper. The biofilm formation on the carbon cloth during the test provides further evidence that the current measured was the result of the bio-chemical reaction taking place. This is important because the biofilm plays a vital role in current production of a microbial fuel cell. Increased biofilm size and thickness ultimately leads to increased current production. Individual bacterial cells metabolize electron-rich substances in a complex process involving many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The electrons are then free to travel to the anode through one of many modes of electron transport. Electron transport is very complicated, and evidence suggests that it is unique to each type of bacteria. For Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1, the most predominantly known ways of shuttling electrons from the individual bacteria cells to the anode are through direct contact, excreted soluble redox molecules, and biological nanowires. Of these, it is widely believed that excreted soluble redox molecules serving as extracellular electron shuttles makes up for as much as 70% of electron transfer mechanisms from individual bacterial cells to the electrode. Moreover, it is shown that direct contact between individual S. Oneidensis MR-1 and the electrode has little impact on the current generation, supporting a mediated electron transfer mechanism. Biofilm helps with the adsorption of the redox molecules to the electrode, which makes it important to have in high power density microbial fuel cells. There are not many studies on power production from paper-based microbial fuel cells running for few days. Without enough time for biofilm to form, the reported current and power data would predominantly be associated with extracellular electron transfer, which represents does not fully represent electrical producing capabilities of microbial fuel cells. This device for the first time demonstrates the longer duration of use and ability to operate individually, a development that could help increase the number of situations where microbial fuel cells can be applied. The Iowa State University team is currently exploring options to better control the voltage output and create constant current. Controlled environment tests will aid in the regulation of the systems output and yield more stable results. For optimal usability and decrease in cost, the team would also like to explore a device that would not need to use Nafion and Potassium Ferricyanide in its application.

The results of the open-label, phase-2 trial were published June 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Jason Gotlib, MD, an associate professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine, led a team of international investigators that conducted the study, which enrolled 116 patients at 29 sites around the world. The study was funded by Novartis Inc., which manufactures midostaurin, also known as PKC412.  Few patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis respond to the currently available drugs,  said Gotlib.  They desperately need an alternative treatment. We are very hopeful that midostaurin will soon be approved by the FDA for this rare disease.  Patients with advanced SM have a poor prognosis, with an expected life span of less than six months to 3.5 years, depending on the disease subtype. Gotlib is the lead author of the study; Andreas Reiter, MD, of the University of Heidelberg, is the senior author. Proliferation of mast cells Systemic mastocytosis is caused by the abnormal accumulation of a type of white blood cell called a mast cell in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, skin and gut. These cells mediate the body s allergic and inflammatory responses and play a role in defending the body against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Patients with systemic mastocytosis can experience flushing, itching, diarrhea and, in some cases, anaphylaxis, when the mast cells release inflammatory mediators such as histamine. In advanced forms of the disease, the infiltration of organs by the mast cells leads to low blood counts and liver function abnormalities as well as malabsorption and weight loss.  About 90 percent of patients with advanced SM have a particular mutation known as D816V in the gene that encodes a protein called KIT that controls the growth of mast cells. KIT is a member of a class of proteins called tyrosine kinases that modulate the activity of many signaling pathways within a cell. Mutations that cause kinases to be  always on  are responsible for many types of cancers, including advanced SM. Drugs known as protein kinase inhibitors are often used to block the activity of the mutated kinases in order to slow or stop disease progression. However, the only currently approved treatment for advanced SM, a kinase inhibitor marketed by Novartis as imatinib, or Gleevec, is not active against the KIT protein with the D816V mutation   leaving most patients without an effective treatment. Lack of options motivates researcher Gotlib, a hematologist, pioneered the testing of midostaurin for advanced SM after becoming frustrated with the lack of treatment options. In 2002, as a hematology fellow at Stanford, he treated a patient who was severely ill with another type of blood cancer caused by a mutated tyrosine kinase. The patient initially responded to imatinib, but developed another mutation in his cancer cells within a few months that led to resistance to the drug. Although Gotlib was unable to save that patient, the experience remained with him. Shortly thereafter, researchers at Harvard showed that the imatinib-resistant cancer that Gotlib s patient developed could be overcome by midostaurin in a mouse model of the disease.  I wondered if midostaurin could work for other patients resistant to imatinib,  Gotlib said. He realized that advanced SM might be a good disease in which to test the drug, given that the majority of patients suffering from it carry the mutated KIT D816V protein resistant to imatinib.  A dramatic response   I didn t have any patients with advanced SM at the time, but another physician in my division was treating someone with mast cell leukemia, a highly fatal variant of systemic mastocytosis,  Gotlib said. He convinced Novartis to allow him to give the patient midostaurin under the company s compassionate-use program.  We saw a dramatic response. The patient, who was near death, improved enough to be released from the hospital, go home and begin cooking meals again.  Although the patient s disease was controlled for only a few months, the experience established the potential activity of midostaurin in advanced SM. As a result, Gotlib, along with colleagues from Stanford and elsewhere, initiated further trials of midostaurin in the United States in 2005, as well as the current, international trial, which was launched in 2009. Study findings Sixty percent of patients in the current trial experienced complete or partial resolution of organ damage related to the disease. As a result, responding patients were less likely to need red blood cell or platelet transfusions and they experienced improvements in liver function and fewer signs of malabsorption such as weight loss. Patients treated with midostaurin who experienced improvement in organ damage or a significant decrease in the percentage of abnormal mast cells in the bone marrow survived significantly longer than those who did not demonstrate these responses. The median overall survival of patients was 28.7 months. The survival benefit among patients with a severe subtype of the disease called mast cell leukemia was particularly striking, according to Gotlib. Although most people succumb to this form of the disease within six months of diagnosis, the median overall survival of all midostaurin-treated mast cell leukemia patients was 9.4 months. Of 39 patients whose spleen size was evaluated, nearly 80 percent saw a reduction in the enlargement that is a common feature of advanced SM that contributes to abdominal pain and decreased appetite. The most frequent side effects of midostaurin were low-grade nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which were usually responsive to administration of the drug with meals and anti-nausea medicines. Patients otherwise reported a significant improvement in disease-related symptoms and quality of life. Midostaurin is currently available on a compassionate-use basis for patients with advanced SM. Gotlib said the investigators hope to evaluate its use in earlier-stage patients whose disease is unresponsive to conventional clinical approaches or to prepare more advanced-stage patients for a bone marrow transplant in an attempt to cure the disease.  This is an evolution of a treatment that originated in 2002 with a patient with an entirely different disease,  Gotlib said.  We hypothesized that midostaurin might work for patients with advanced SM, and that led to a case report and ultimately the current international trial. Our study represents more than a decade of work and collaboration between academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and the SM patient community, and we are very hopeful that it will lead to approval of a new treatment for this rare, devastating disease.

Our ability to observe and track each individual protein within these machines is crucial to our ultimate understanding of these processes. Yet, the advent of super-resolution microscopy that has allowed researchers to start visualizing closely positioned molecules or molecular complexes with 10-20 nanometer resolution is not powerful enough to distinguish individual molecular features within those densely packed complexes. A team at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering led by Core Faculty member Peng Yin, Ph.D., has, for the first time, been able to tell apart features distanced only 5 nanometers from each other in a densely packed, single molecular structure and to achieve the so far highest resolution in optical microscopy. Reported on July 4 in a study in Nature Nanotechnology, the technology, also called ""discrete molecular imaging"" (DMI), enhances the team s DNA nanotechnology-powered super-resolution microscopy platform with an integrated set of new imaging methods. Last year, the opportunity to enable researchers with inexpensive super-resolution microscopy using DNA-PAINT-based technologies led the Wyss Institute to launch its spin-off Ultivue Inc. ""The ultra-high resolution of DMI advances the DNA-PAINT platform one step further towards the vision of providing the ultimate view of biology. With this new power of resolution and the ability to focus on individual molecular features, DMI complements current structural biology methods like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. It opens up a way for researchers to study molecular conformations and heterogeneities in single multi-component complexes, and provides an easy, fast and multiplexed method for the structural analysis of many samples in parallel"" said Peng Yin, who is also Professor of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. DNA-PAINT technologies, developed by Yin and his team are based on the transient binding of two complementary short DNA strands, one being attached to the molecular target that the researchers aim to visualize and the other attached to a fluorescent dye. Repeated cycles of binding and unbinding create a very defined blinking behavior of the dye at the target site, which is highly programmable by the choice of DNA strands and has now been further exploited by the team s current work to achieve ultra-high resolution imaging. ""By further harnessing key aspects underlying the blinking conditions in our DNA-PAINT-based technologies and developing a novel method that compensates for tiny but extremely disruptive movements of the microscope stage that carries the samples, we managed to additionally boost the potential beyond what has been possible so far in super-resolution microscopy,"" said Mingjie Dai, who is the study s first author and a Graduate Student working with Yin. In addition, the study was co-authored by Ralf Jungmann, Ph.D., a former Postdoctoral Fellow on Yin s team and now a Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. The Wyss Institute s scientists have benchmarked the ultra-high resolution of DMI using synthetic DNA nanostructures. Next, the researchers plan to apply the technology to actual biological complexes such as the protein complex that duplicates DNA in dividing cells or cell surface receptors binding their ligands. ""Peng Yin and his team have yet again broken through barriers never before possible by leveraging the power of programmable DNA, not for information storage, but create nanoscale 'molecular instruments' that carry out defined tasks and readout what they analyze. This new advancement to their DNA-powered super-resolution imaging platform is an amazing feat that has the potential to uncover the inner workings of cells at the single molecule level using conventional microscopes that are available in common biology laboratories,"" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and also Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

The goal is to offer a quick, accurate and inexpensive method to help contain future epidemics.  ""We have had some very exciting initial results with this fast, low-cost platform for detecting infection with the Ebola virus,"" said Stephen Chou, the Joseph C. Elgin Professor of Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton. ""We believe it is now worthwhile to start up a much larger program to explore this emerging technology."" The test relies on technology developed at Princeton that uses nanoscale structures to significantly increase the detection of the Ebola virus in a sample of body fluid. Called the M-Plate, the technology works in part by amplifying the light emitted in testing for the virus. The researchers believe the M-Plate technology could provide hundreds of thousands, and possibly up to 10 million, times greater sensitivity compared to a standard test, called an immunoassay.  This improvement would allow health care workers to identify, quarantine and treat Ebola-infected people earlier than previously practical   possibly several days before they become contagious and begin to exhibit symptoms. The researchers expect the test results to be readable on a smartphone.  Chou and colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) recently received a $5.6 million grant to further develop the M-plate Ebola Virus Assay. The collaborators hope to develop a deployable version in about three years.  Princeton scientists including Chou and his key collaborator, Associate Research Scholar Liangcheng Zhou, have worked on the M-plate for six years. The M-Plate's surface consists of a thin layer of gold studded by hundreds of glass pillars just 60 nanometers across   about a thousandth of the width of a human hair. Gold particles measuring about 10 to 15 nanometers dot the pillars, which also sport large gold caps, making them look somewhat like mushrooms. This tiny, complex architecture captures and boosts light signals. In the M-plate Ebola Virus Assay, light is generated when viral proteins in a sample are captured by a specialized protein preloaded into the assay. The captured viral proteins are then tagged with an ""optical label,"" which are molecules that glow, or fluoresce, when a beam of ultraviolet light shines on them. Thanks to the light-amplifying properties of the M-plate, the researchers anticipate that only a very small amount of viral protein need be in the bodily fluid sample to generate sufficient fluorescent light for positive identification.  A low threshold for detection is important because when a person first becomes infected with the Ebola virus, the amount of viral protein in their blood, urine and saliva starts off small. As the pathogen invades its human host's cells and replicates, viral levels rapidly escalate. Yet the virus' presence often remains undetectable by traditional immunoassay until after the initial symptoms of a fever, sore throat, headaches and muscle pain have already set in, anywhere from two to 21 days post-infection, by which time the disease can be spread to others and spur an epidemic.  Another test, known as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), can also provide early detection   sometimes a day before symptom onset   but has drawbacks, including cost and complexity. The researchers believe it should be possible to use the M-Plate technology to develop a test that is simpler and less expensive than the PCR version but also provides more lead time.  ""Our grand goal is to have the M-plate Ebola Virus Assay make diagnoses before symptoms show up,"" said Chou.  ""Better, rapid tests that can quickly tell us who is and who is not infected will greatly improve our ability to respond effectively to future outbreaks of Ebola or similar epidemics from infectious diseases,"" said Arthur Reingold, professor and head of epidemiology at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health, who is not part of Chou's research effort.  While work on the M-Plate sensor continues at Princeton, the FDA will contribute its expertise in the study of Ebola virus detection antibodies and USAMRIID will advance the testing through its program of Ebola virus prevention and treatment research on nonhuman primates in its biosafety level 4 laboratories, the highest level of biosafety precaution.  Although sporadic outbreaks of viruses such as Ebola that cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans have been documented since the late 1960s, the largest epidemic in history struck just three years ago. Largely contained now, the Ebola outbreak has killed more than 11,300 people, mainly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Due to drops in trade, foreign investment and tourism, the epidemic has had severe economic consequences throughout Western Africa.  Numerous treatments, such as vaccines, and better lab and field tests like the M-plate Ebola Virus Assay, are in the works. The hope is that when the next outbreak happens, the world will be far better prepared, said Chou. Chou envisions that his testing apparatus will also be further expanded to detect Ebola's deadly cousins such as Sudan virus, as well as the closely related Marburg virus and other deadly viruses.  ""We want to do point-of-care as soon as possible,"" said Chou. ""Early detection of the Ebola virus will give us tremendous advantages in halting would-be epidemics in their tracks."" Previous funding for the Chou Lab, the M-plate platform and the M-plate EBOV assay has come partly from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Old School Fund, Helen Shipley Hunt Fund, and the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Transformative Technology Fund.

The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, in partnership with the Ministry of Health of Liberia and the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. The six-month study will enroll 60 to 120 EVD survivors whose semen has evidence of Ebola virus RNA prior to their enrollment. Participants in the double-blind trial will receive either investigational drug GS-5734, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or a placebo. Liberia was one of the hardest hit countries during the Ebola epidemic of 2014-15. On June 9, the World Health Organization declared the end of the most recent outbreak in Liberia and the country entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance to ensure that any new cases are quickly identified and contained.  We know that traces of Ebola virus can sometimes remain in a recovered person s body and can initiate a new bout of illness in the survivor or be passed onto others, which could start a new chain of infection in the community,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  The goal of the PREVAIL IV trial is to see if the experimental drug can eliminate the traces of Ebola virus from semen in men who have survived Ebola infection. It is anticipated that this would decrease the risk of passing the virus to their sexual partners. If so, the drug would be another weapon in our arsenal against Ebola virus disease.  Upon enrollment, volunteers in the new trial will receive the study drug (or placebo) once a day for five days and will provide multiple blood and semen samples during this period. All volunteers must have previously enrolled in the PREVAIL III Ebola Natural History study for survivors and their household and sexual contacts. Prior to enrollment, volunteers will be tested for normal kidney and liver function. Volunteers will be seen at the clinic 10 times in the first month and then once a month for the remaining five months. Volunteers will provide blood and semen samples throughout the trial period. Investigators will test the semen samples to see if Ebola viral RNA can continue to be detected. All volunteers will be counseled to use condoms during the course of the trial. GS-5734 has previously been tested for safety in healthy men and women in the United States. In that study, no serious side effects of the experimental drug were detected, but some volunteers experienced a rise and then a fall in liver enzyme levels. This information has been incorporated into the new trial by the study investigators, who will be monitoring volunteers for kidney and liver function during the trial. In non-human primates infected experimentally with a lethal dose of Ebola virus, GS-5734 has been shown to reduce viremia and to improve survival. The co-principal investigators of the PREVAIL IV trial are Dehkontee Gayedyu-Dennis, M.D., site physician at Duport Road PREVAIL site, Monrovia; Elizabeth Higgs, M.D., NIAID; and William A. Fischer II, M.D., of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Participants for the Prevail IV study will be recruited from the PREVAIL III study of Ebola survivors and their close contacts which opened in June 2015. Prevail III aims to better understand the long-term consequences of Ebola virus disease, Ebola virus persistence and transmission risk to close contacts, and includes components that assess mental health, eye health and other issues in survivors. NIAID conducts and supports research   at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide   to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.","Published: July 6, 2016"

The study, funded by NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and led by Carrie L. Byington, M.D., from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, aims to improve understanding of how the virus persists in the body and to identify potential factors that influence the course of infection.  Zika virus infection poses many unknown risks, especially to those of reproductive age,  said Catherine Y. Spong, M.D., acting director of NICHD.  Monitoring the health and reproductive outcomes of members of the U.S. Olympic team offers a unique opportunity to answer important questions and help address an ongoing public health emergency.  USOC established an Infectious Disease Advisory Group (IDAG), chaired by Dr. Byington, to help prepare the U.S. Olympic team for travel to Brazil, which is the epicenter of the Zika virus outbreak in the Americas. Dr. Byington proposed the project, which aims to enroll at least 1,000 men and women, in response to an NIH announcement designed to expedite review and funding for Zika-related research projects.  We partnered with the USOC to improve knowledge of the dynamics of Zika infection, so that we can better protect the health of athletes and staff who will participate in the 2016 Games,  said Dr. Byington.  This ongoing relationship also opens avenues for long-term research that promises to benefit not only the Americas, but also other regions facing the emergence of the virus.  The current study seeks to determine the incidence of Zika virus infection, identify potential risk factors for infection, detect where the virus persists in the body (blood, semen, vaginal secretions or saliva), evaluate how long the virus remains in these fluids, and study the reproductive outcomes of Zika-infected participants for up to one year. To prepare, USOC and the University of Utah conducted a pilot study in March and April 2016. The study was fully enrolled in two days and included 150 participants. Notably, one-third of the pilot group indicated that they or their partner planned to become pregnant within 12 months of the Olympic Games. Participants in the current study will complete health surveys and provide samples of bodily fluids for the detection of Zika and similar flaviviruses, such as dengue. Zika virus infection typically does not cause symptoms in adults, so routine sampling will detect asymptomatic infections and help shed light on symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections. Zika virus testing kits and training on how to use the tests will be provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before traveling to Brazil, all USOC staff, including athletes and coaches, will be briefed on a number of items, including the Zika outbreak. IDAG will provide educational materials to athletes and staff and answer questions. During this time, the NIH-funded researchers will present the study and enroll as well as consent USOC staff who are interested in participating. Approximately 3,000 USOC staff members are expected to travel to Brazil. In addition, spouses or sexual partners who are traveling to Brazil may be eligible to participate. The 2016 Summer Olympics will take place in Rio de Janeiro, from Aug. 5-21, 2016, and the Paralympic Games are scheduled for Sept. 7-18, 2016.","Published: July 6, 2016"

The findings, published online in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, represent a quicker and less invasive way to identify impending cognitive decline and begin treatment before progression to established, irreversible dementia. See Also: Being underweight in middle age associated with increased dementia risk ""MCI is often a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia,"" said senior author Robert A. Rissman, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, director of the Biomarker Core for the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and director of the Neuropathology Core and Brain Bank for the UC San Diego Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. ""It's associated with more minor cognitive impairment and carries an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia."" MCI patients progress to AD at rates as high as 10 to 15 percent per year, prompting an increased emphasis upon diagnosing MCI early and developing treatments that can delay or prevent conversion to AD. The need is underscored, write the authors, by the fact that clinical trials of treatments for established AD have thus far failed. While clinically distinguishable from normal aging and AD, MCI remains nonetheless a complex condition with many and varied causes. ""That has prompted great interest in pinpointing underlying biomarkers that can predict the conversion from MCI to AD dementia,"" said Rissman. ""Finding such biomarkers would also identify persons most likely to be responsive to preventive treatments."" Learn More: Three-minute test detects common form of dementia that's hard to diagnose Currently, the accepted methods for diagnosing preclinical AD patients is to detect protein biomarkers found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in combination with advanced neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing. But CSF sampling involves an invasive, often painful, process. Neuroimaging is expensive. Neuropsychological testing is time-consuming and can often vary from visit to visit. The new method described in the Alzheimer's & Dementia study evaluated the potential of exosomes -- extremely small vesicles or sacs found in most cell types, including neurons. Exosomes are thought to move materials inside cells and are used to dump cellular trash into the bloodstream for disposal. In the case of disease, Rissman's group predicted that neuronal derived exosomes (NDEs) would carry damaged or excess proteins and metabolites out of brain cells, among them amyloid and tau biomarker proteins that are strongly associated with AD. The researchers harvested NDEs from human blood plasma of 60 patients who participated in an 18-month ADCS clinical trial that enrolled MCI patients only. Some of these MCI patients converted to AD over the course of the study and some did not. Rissman's lab also gathered samples from control patients and samples from known AD patients. They enriched the NDE content of those originating from neurons. The samples represented patients with normal cognitive function, diagnoses of stable MCI and stable AD and patients who had recently transitioned from MCI to AD. After characterizing NDEs by size, shape and concentration, the researchers compared that data with the different patient cohorts. They found that NDEs carried targeted biomarker proteins, which have previously been found to predict development of AD up to 10 years before onset of clinical symptoms, and correctly distinguished 100 percent of patients with AD from normal cohorts. Don't Miss: Current screening methods miss worrisome number of persons with mild cognitive impairmentMoreover, the researchers showed for the first time that plasma NDEs from AD and MCI patients may propagate tau tangles in the brains of normal mice similar to what is seen in human AD brains. The fact that these NDEs could induce pathological-like structures in ""na ve"" mice (animals not previously subjected to experiments) suggests that the contents of NDEs are bioactive, said Rissman. It also suggests that released NDEs can be taken up by cells, raising the possibility of NDEs potential for drug delivery. The development of blood-based biomarkers for AD (and other neurodegenerative diseases) diagnostics could significantly improve the effectiveness and reliability of patient care and future research, said the authors, who encouraged further studies to refine and validate the approach.

So says lead author Yoko Sakuraba of Kyoto University, in an article in Primates, the official journal of the Japan Monkey Centre. In their normal work, researchers of the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University use chimpanzees' interaction with computers and touch screens to study the cognition and perception of these primates. When Reo was paralyzed from the neck down, dedicated staff put this technology to further use by encouraging the animal to walk again. This is the first case in which a paralyzed chimpanzee has been rehabilitated through such a dedicated programme. See Also: Non-surgical approach helps people with paralysis voluntarily move their legs   a first When Reo was 24 years old in 2006, he suddenly became paralyzed when a portion of his spinal cord became inflamed. For the first ten months thereafter, the chimpanzee was severely disabled, lying on his back. He gradually recovered enough to sit up, and could later pull himself upright by using suspended ropes. Intensive physiotherapy over a period of 41 months followed, after which he was able to climb about again using only his arms. To aid Reo's ultimate integration back among the other twelve animals held at the institute, his carers decided to try to get him walking again. They incorporate a computerised task in this process. This was considered an option because in his youth Reo had learnt how to perform cognitive tasks on a touch panel, and in so doing had become used to receiving food rewards whenever he succeeded at tasks presented to him. A computer-controlled monitor was therefore placed on one wall, and cognitive tasks were again put to him. It was not plain sailing at first, and the research team had to adapt their ideas seven times before they received any cooperation from a somewhat fearful Reo. Thereafter, whenever he completed a task successfully, a food reward was placed on a tray on the opposite side of the room. This meant that Reo had to move at least two meters to reach it. To busy himself at the screen again to start a new task, he had to make the two meter return journey. Don't Miss: Neuroprosthetics for paralysis: an new implant on the spinal cord At first he did so using a rope for assistance, but gradually he started travelling in an upright seated position which resembled the side-to-side manner of a penguin walking on land. The rehabilitation sessions encouraged him to increase his movements considerably, and he started walking up to five hundred meters in a two-hour session. ""Cognitive tasks may be a useful way to rehabilitate physically disabled chimpanzees, and thus improve their welfare in captivity,"" says Sakuraba, who says that euthanasia need not be the only option for animals injured in captivity. She further notes that the personality and physical condition of each animal must be considered when designing and adjusting such a rehabilitation program.

The researchers also found the copper-induced misfolding and clumping is associated with inflammation and damage to nerve cells in brain tissue from a mouse model. See Also: New test detects toxic prions in blood Prions are abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and induce abnormal folding of a specific type of protein called prion proteins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prion proteins are mostly found in the brain. The abnormal folding of prion proteins leads to brain damage and symptoms of neurodegenerative disease. A similar cycle of neuronal protein misfolding and clumping is observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. ""Our study establishes a direct link, at the molecular level, between copper exposure and prion protein neurotoxicity,"" the researchers wrote in a summary of the paper. The findings are published in the journal Science Advances. The corresponding author is Sanjeevi Sivasankar, an Iowa State University associate professor of physics and astronomy; the first author is Chi-Fu Yen, an Iowa State doctoral student in electrical and computer engineering. Co-authors are Anumantha Kanthasamy, an Iowa State Clarence Hartley Covault Distinguished Professor in Veterinary Medicine, chair of biomedical sciences and director of the Iowa Center for Advanced Neurotoxicology; and Dilshan Harischandra, an Iowa State doctoral student in biomedical sciences. Grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences at the National Institutes of Health supported the project, including one from the Virtual Consortium for Transdisciplinary Environmental Research. Although this study determined that copper-induced misfolding and clumping of prion proteins is associated with the degeneration of nerve tissues, Sivasankar cautioned that the study does not directly address the infectivity of prion diseases. Learn More: Solving the next step in the mystery of prions ""There are different strains of misfolded prion proteins and not all of them are pathogenic,"" Sivasankar said. ""Although we do not show that the strains generated in our experiments are infectious, we do prove that copper ions trigger misfolding of prion proteins which causes toxicity in nerve cells."" The Sivasankar and Kanthasamy research groups plan to perform additional studies to determine if the copper-induced misfolding causes disease. Integrating approaches Sivasankar also noted that a unique aspect of this project was the integration of biophysical and neurotoxicological research approaches. He said the combination has the potential to transform studies of the molecular basis for neurodegenerative diseases. The biophysical approaches Sivasankar's team developed for this study include: The Kanthasamy and Sivasankar research groups worked together on a real-time, quaking-induced conversion assay to demonstrate that misfolded prion proteins serve as seeds that trigger the misfolding and clumping of nearby prion proteins. Kanthasamy's research group also used its expertise in neurotoxicology to show the copper-induced, misfolded prion proteins damage nerve cells in slices of brain tissue from mice. Taken together, the results identify the biophysical conditions and mechanisms for copper-induced prion protein misfolding, clumping and neurotoxicity, the researchers wrote. Related: Prion trials and tribulations: Finding the right tools and experimental models""This was a very comprehensive study,"" Sivasankar said. ""We took it from single molecules all the way to tissues."" And, although the study doesn't address the infectious nature of prion diseases, Kanthasamy said it is still important: ""This study has major implications to our understanding the role of metals in protein misfolding diseases including prion, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.""

Diamond offers 26 separate beamlines to aid with research groups in the UK and abroad, allowing them to determine the three dimensional structure of matter, such as protein molecules, on the atomic scale. This can help to aid with drug design and to assist in the understanding of how these proteins function. There are several beamlines already running at Diamond which allow the study of protein crystals ranging from 5-100 microns in size. However, as the systems get more complicated, inherently the crystals get smaller, so the beamline currently being built will allow the study of crystals ~500 nm to 5 microns in size.  Due to the small size of these crystals, Dr Warren is using a JEOL SEM to visualise the crystals and align them to the X-ray beam to carry out the experiments. The crystals are very fragile and prone to dehydration. This means they have to be stored, handled and studied at liquid nitrogen temperatures. This is where the Quorum PP3000T cryo-SEM preparation system has been of great use. Dr Warren takes up the story:  It has allowed us to visualise crystals less than a micron in size at cryogenic temperatures. This technique has never been used in our field in this way so we are currently carrying out a lot of research to understand the best ways of handling and preparing samples to obtain the best quality images. This would be impossible without having the Quorum preparation system and cryo-stage as the crystals would deteriorate in quality. Quorum was very helpful when we started looking at systems to purchase, especially as they have an SEM and cryo-SEM set up in Laughton. We were able to test out our samples in advance to get an understanding of whether it would work for us. Since making our purchase decision, we found that the preparation desk/slushing station have become a vital part of our sample preparation and this has been invaluable for our experiments. The image at the top illustrates the data quality we get routinely   crystals of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV20). The crystals shown here are in the size range 2.5 to 5  m.  The Quorum PP3010T and PP3000T are highly automated, easy to use, column-mounted, gas-cooled cryo preparation systems suitable for most makes and models of SEM, FE-SEM and FIB/SEM. Highly efficient cooling allows temperatures of down to 190  C to be routinely achieved. The systems include facilities for rapid freezing, cold fracturing, controlled sublimation and high resolution sputter coating. The typical process time for samples is between five and ten minutes.

As an urban public university, Cleveland State has a dual mission to both serve the community and to contribute to the city's redevelopment in ways that many institutions cannot. By bringing a high level of engagement to our education, Cleveland State is developing into one of the best urban universities in the nation. Investment at the ground roots graduate level is illustrated by the recent purchase of benchtop NMR spectrometry to offer students hands-on experience of the latest in scientific instrumentation.  Dr Vania De Paoli is an associate college lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at Cleveland State University in Ohio. She is leading a program to create a solid environment for teaching Organic Chemistry. This focuses on critical thinking and analysis where every experiment is seen as a small project. The goal allows sudents to experience every experiment performed in lab as a (junior) scientist. Not only are synthetic skills important, but the students also need to be able to analyze their reagents and products to answer questions such as ""does what I have made need extra putification"" or ""what was my yield?""  Prior to investing in the Magritek benchtop NMR spectrometer, students' practical options were limited to the measurement of melting points and refractive index. Old gas chromatographs were so old, they were no longer functional. Students were not experiencing anything close to life in a modern organic chemistry laboratory.  As Dr De Paoli says, the Spinsolve has changed this position immensely. ""It is a small system, portable and lightweight. It is quickly ready to use allowing the students to have a real NMR analysis experience (they prepare the samples in standard NMR tubes, add the solvent and record the spectra in similar ways to a research grade NMR). The spectra are of good quality. The software is friendly and, overall, Spinsolve is readily affordable.""  To complement the spectrometer, Magritek provides a series of support aids to those teaching NMR. These include videos, practical experiment protocols and lab manuals.

But instead of popping up on the bicep of a bodybuilder, these muscles grow on a tiny scaffold or  chip  molded from a type of water-logged gel made from gelatin. First authors Archana Bettadapur and Gio Suh describe these muscles-on-a-chip in a new study published in Scientific Reports. During normal embryonic development, skeletal muscles form when cells called myoblasts fuse to form muscle fibers, known as myotubes. In past experiments, mouse myotubes have detached or delaminated from protein-coated plastic scaffolds after approximately one week and failed to thrive. In this experiment, the researchers fabricated a gel scaffold from gelatin, a derivative of the naturally occurring muscle protein collagen, and achieved much better results. After three weeks, many of the mouse myotubes were still adhering to these gelatin chips, and they were longer, wider and more developed as a result. The researchers anticipate that human myotubes would thrive equally well on gelatin chips. These new and improved  muscles-on-a-chip  could then be used to study human muscle development and disease, as well as provide a relevant testing ground for new potential drugs.  Disease and disorders involving skeletal muscle   ranging from severe muscular dystrophies to the gradual decrease in muscle mass with aging   dramatically reduce the quality of life for millions of people,  said McCain, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.  By creating an inexpensive and accessible platform for studying skeletal muscle in the laboratory, we hope to enable research that will usher in new treatments for these patients.  Lou Gehrig s disease McCain is already putting the gelatin chips into action as the winner of an Eli and Edythe Broad Innovation Award in Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at USC. The award provides $120,000 to McCain and her two collaborators: Justin Ichida, assistant professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine; and Dion Dickman, assistant professor of biological sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. In their project, they will use the gelatin chips for studying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig s disease, which damages the intersections between motor nerve cells and muscle cells, called neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). McCain, Ichida and Dickman will use skin or blood cells from patients with ALS to generate and study NMJs on gelatin chips.

Seven days after OLIG2 was switched on, cultured human stem cells started expressing neuronal marker gene (red). (Katayama S. et. al., Angewandte Chemie International Edition, April 15, 2016) The ability to control gene expression in cells allows scientists to understand gene function and manipulate cell fate. Recently, scientists have developed a revolutionary gene-editing tool, called CRIPSR/Cas9, which employs a system naturally used by bacteria as protection against viruses. The tool allows scientists to precisely add, remove or replace specific parts of DNA. CRISPR/Cas9 is the most efficient, inexpensive and easiest gene-editing tool available to date. However, scientists have not yet managed to effectively use it to activate genes in the cells. A team, led by Toru Kondo at Hokkaido University s Institute of Genetic Medicine, has developed a powerful new method that does just that. Genes in cells have their own switches called promoters. A gene is switched off, or silenced, when its promoter is methylated. The team effectively wanted to turn on a switched-off gene. They combined a DNA repair mechanism, called MMEJ (microhomology-mediated end-joining), with CRISPR/Cas9. They cut out a methylated promoter using CRISPR/Cas9 and then inserted an unmethylated promoter with MMEJ, replacing the off-switch with an on-switch. The scientists used this tool on the neural cell gene OLIG2 and the embryonic stem cell gene NANOG to test its efficiency in cultured cells. Within five days, they found evidence that the genes were robustly expressed. When they turned on OLIG2 in cultured human stem cells, the cells differentiated to neurons in seven days with high efficiency. The scientists also found that their editing tool could be used to activate other silenced promoters. In addition, they found that the system didn t cause unwanted mutations in other non-targeted genes in the cells. The tool has wide potential to be used to manipulate gene expression, create genetic circuits, or to engineer cell fates.","Published: July 5, 2016"

A Mediterranean emblem par excellence, it is of vital importance to the Spanish and other regional economies (Italy, Greece and Portugal). In fact, Spain is the leading producer of olive oil in the world. Every year, nearly three million tons of oil are produced, for local consumption and export. Spain produces one third of this total. Nonetheless, up to now, the genome of the olive tree was unknown. The genome regulate such factors as the differences among varieties, sizes and flavor of the olives, why the trees live so long or the reasons for their adaptation to dryland farming. Now a team of researchers from the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona, the Real Jardin Bot nico (CSIC-RJB) and the Centro Nacional de An lisis Gen mico (CNAG-CRG), has brought new insight to the genetic puzzle of the olive tree, by sequencing the complete genome of this species for the first time ever. The results of this work, fully funded by Banco Santander, have been published in the groundbreaking Open Access and Open Data journal GigaScience. The article will pave the way to new research work that will help olive trees in their development and protecting them from infections now causing major damage, such as the attacks of bacteria (Xilella fastidiosa) and fungi (Verticillium dhailae).  Without a doubt, it is an emblematic tree, and it is very difficult to improve plant breeding, as you have to wait at least 12 years to see what morphological characteristics it will have, and whether it is advisable to cross-breed,  says principal author of this paper Toni Gabald n, ICREA research professor and head of the comparative genomics laboratory at the CRG.  Knowing the genetic information of the olive tree will let us contribute to the improvement of oil and olive production, of major relevance to the Spanish economy,  he adds. Private funding to support public science The story of this project begins with a presentation, a coincidence and a challenge. Four years ago, Gabald n worked with Pablo Vargas, a CSIC researcher at the Real Jard n Bot nico, on the presentation of scientific results of projects focused on endangered species, such as the Iberian lynx, that had been financed by Banco Santander. At that time, Banco Santander had expressed great interest in financing scientific projects in Spain. Over the course of the presentation, Pablo Vargas proposed to Emilio Bot n the complete sequencing of the olive tree genome, using the same technology as had been used to sequence the lynx; in other words, the most state-of-the-art technological strategy to achieve a high-quality genome. Five months after that meeting, a contract was signed to carry out the first complete sequencing of the olive tree s DNA, a three-year research effort coordinated by Pablo Vargas.  There are three phases to genome sequencing: first, isolate all of the genes, which we published two years ago. Second, assemble the genome, which is a matter of ordering those genes one after the other, like linking up loose phrases in a book. Last, identify all of the genes, or binding the book. The latter two phases are what we have done and are now presenting,  says the CSIC Real Jard n Bot nico researcher. To continue with the book analogy, according to Tyler Alioto of the CNAG-CRG  this genome has generated some 1.31 billion letters, and over 1,000 GBytes of data. We are surprised because we have detected over 56,000 genes, significantly more than those detected in sequenced genomes of related plants, and twice that of the human genome.  Decoding its evolutionary history In addition to the complete sequencing of the olive tree genome, researchers have also compared the DNA of this thousand-year-old tree with other varieties such as the wild olive. They have also found the transcriptome, the genes expressed to determine what differences exist on the genetic expression level in leaves, roots and fruits at different stages of ripening. The next step, researchers say, will be to decode the evolutionary history of this tree, which has formed part of old-world civilizations since the Bronze Age. At that time, in the eastern Mediterranean, the process of domesticating wild olive trees that led to today s trees began. Later, selection processes in different Mediterranean countries gave rise to the nearly 1,000 varieties of trees we have today. Knowing the evolution of olive trees from different countries will make it possible to know their origins and discover the keys that have allowed it to adapt to very diverse environmental conditions. It will also help discover the reasons behind its extraordinary longevity, as the trees can live for 3,000 to 4,000 years.  That longevity makes the olive tree we have sequenced practically a living monument,  says Gabald n.  Up to now, all of the individuals sequenced, from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to the first human being analyzed, have lived for a certain time, depending on their life expectancy, but then died or will die. This is the first time that the DNA of an individual over 1,000 years old, and that will probably live another 1,000 years, has been sequenced.  say Gabald n and Vargas.","Published: July 5, 2016"

The good is that the drugs do often effectively kill cancer cells. The bad is that the drugs also damage other quickly dividing cells in the body, causing side effects ranging from cosmetic, like hair loss, to disabling. The ugly occurs when the drug dose needed to kill a tumor is more than what a person s body can handle. This might happen if the tumor doesn t have much of a blood supply and very little of the drug, which is delivered through the bloodstream, can get in. A dose high enough to infiltrate the tumor could be deadly to other cells in the body. Some recently approved therapies get around this problem using antibodies to deliver a drug directly to tumors, bypassing healthy cells and possibly overcoming some of the uglier aspects of cancer chemotherapy. Now Jennifer Cochran, associate professor of bioengineering, has built on this antibody approach using an engineered protein rather than an antibody to direct the drug to the tumor. Although the two techniques are conceptually similar, the specialized protein has the potential advantage of being able to pass through the barrier that protects the brain, thereby being able to treat brain tumors. It is also smaller than the antibody and might be able to reach dense tumors with little blood supply.  Antibodies can be limited for treating solid tumors because they are too big to penetrate well,  Cochran said.  The idea is that a smaller molecule could diffuse into the tumor better.  The work was published in a series of papers in the June issue of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics and the June 15 issue of Angewandte Chemie. Targeting cancer Cochran s idea originated with the knowledge that cancer cells, and the blood supply that feeds them, often produce particular molecules known as integrins on their surface. The goal of her team was to create an engineered protein that could latch tightly onto those integrins and be used as a drug delivery vehicle. First, the team needed to engineer a protein to bind integrins. Cochran employed a technique called directed evolution to rapidly engineer millions of proteins and screen for the qualities she s interested in. In this case, they started with a protein called knottin   so named for its knot-like shape   and used directed evolution to engineer a protein variant that would bind strongly to integrins. The researchers then worked on two strategies for attaching chemotherapeutic drugs to the evolved knottin. One strategy, carried out in collaboration with Sutro Biopharma, and led by postdoctoral fellow Nicolas Currier and bioengineering graduate student Shelley Ackerman, used a portion of an antibody to connect the drug to the knottin, mimicking antibody therapies that are already on the market   perhaps speeding the time it would take to get this therapy approved for patients. The team tested this approach in a lab dish and in mice with implanted human tumors and in each case the knottin successfully delivered the drug to the tumor and killed the cancer cells. A second approach, developed in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Nick Cox in the Stanford ChEM-H Medicinal Chemistry Knowledge Center, used a small chemical link to attach a chemotherapeutic drug directly to the knottin. The knottin-drug combination effectively killed breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells in a lab dish. The targeted drug delivery was highly effective against cancer cells, including those that had developed a resistance to the drug alone.  We found that when the drug was delivered by the knottin, its potency was greatly enhanced in treating highly resistant tumor cells, like those found in pancreatic cancer,  Cox said. In both examples, the knottin portion of these multipart compounds binds to integrins present at high levels on cancer cells, delivering the drug directly into the cancer cell and bypassing healthy cells. Once inside, the drug is released and kills the cell. Because the drug is less active when connected to the knottin and cannot get inside cells of the body that do not express integrins, this approach could significantly reduce side effects on other tissues and organs. Building on the past This isn t the first time Cochran has taken advantage of knottin s affection for cancer cells. In previous work her team had attached the engineered knottin to a fluorescent dye that was visible by molecular imaging techniques. This dye-labeled knottin could seek out and attach to cancer cells in the brain and elsewhere in the body and make them visible to doctors, who often have a hard time detecting whether drugs are shrinking tumors. That previous work gave Cochran and her team some useful information. First, they learned that the knottin can get past a barrier that protects the brain from many molecules. And second, they learned that the knottin does seek out cancer cells compared to healthy tissue. If it didn t, the imaging signal would show a blur of light rather than visibly highlighting tumors.  We ve shown that these knottins can pass the blood-tumor barrier so the hope is that we can use this to deliver chemotherapy to brain tumors,  Cochran said. Cochran is collaborating with Michelle Monje, assistant professor of neurology, and Gerald Grant, associate professor of neurosurgery, with the support of seed grants from Stanford Bio-X and the Stanford Child Health Research Institute to test this approach on childhood brain tumors. These two knottin-based therapies are a first step.  These studies showed that we could use these molecules to deliver drugs to tumors,  Cochran said.  What we still need to understand is which cancers it works best on and what is the best chemotherapeutic drug to use.  She and her team are also still exploring which of the two approaches will be most effective. The larger protein-drug combination might not work its way into dense tumors, for example, but will remain longer in the body and thus might deliver more benefits over time. The smaller compound could penetrate more effectively into tumors but will be cleared quickly from the bloodstream, possibly reducing its effectiveness. Cochran is a professor of bioengineering and, by courtesy, of chemical engineering. She is also a member of Stanford Bio-X, the Child Health Research Institute, the Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford ChEM-H and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute.

For decades, Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, has been known to be associated with the accumulation of so-called neurofibrillary tangles, consisting of abnormal clumps of a protein called tau inside brain nerve cells, and by neuritic plaques, or deposits of a protein called beta-amyloid outside these cells along with dying nerve cells, in brain tissue. See Also: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein In Alzheimer's disease, tau bunches up inside the nerve cells and beta-amyloid clumps up outside these cells, mucking up the nerve cells controlling memory, notes Philip C. Wong, PhD, professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. What hasn't been clear is the relationship and timing between those two clumping processes, since one is inside cells and one is outside cells, says lead and corresponding study author Tong Li, PhD, an assistant professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins. Prior studies of early-onset Alzheimer's disease have suggested that the abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain somehow triggers the aggregation of tau leading directly to dementia and brain cell degeneration. But the new research from Li, Wong and colleagues suggests that the accumulation of beta-amyloid in and of itself is insufficient to trigger the conversion of tau from a normal to abnormal state. Instead, their studies show, it may set off a chain of chemical signaling events that lead to the ""conversion"" of tau to a clumping state and subsequent development of symptoms. ""For the first time, we think we understand that the accumulation of amyloid plaque alone can damage the brain, but that's actually not sufficient to drive the loss of nerve cells or behavioral and cognitive changes,"" Wong says. ""What appears to be needed is a second insult the conversion of tau as well."" In humans, the lag between development of the beta-amyloid plaques and the tau tangles inside brain nerve cells can be 10 to 15 years or more, Li says, but because the lifetime of a mouse is only two to three years, current animal models that successfully mimic the appearance of beta-amyloid plaques did not offer enough time to observe the changes in tau. Learn More: Immunotherapy used to reduce memory problems with Alzheimer s disease To address that problem, the Johns Hopkins researchers genetically engineered a mouse model that used a tau fragment to promote the clumping of normal tau protein. They then cross-bred these mice with mice engineered to accumulate beta-amyloid. The result was a mouse model that developed dementia in a manner more similar to what happens in humans, Li says. The researchers found during brain dissections of the animals that the presence of beta-amyloid plaque alone was not sufficient to cause the biochemical conversion of tau, the repeat domain of tau the part of tau protein that is responsible for the conversion of normal tau to an abnormal state alone was insufficient for the conversion of tau, beta-amyloid plaques must be present in the brain for the conversion of tau and the tau fragments could ""seed"" the plaque-dependent pathological conversion of tau. One implication of the new research, Wong says, is to possibly explain why some drugs designed to attack the disease after the conversion of tau haven't worked. ""The timing may be off,"" he says. ""If you were to intervene in the time period before the conversion of tau, you might have a good chance of ameliorating the deficits, brain cell loss and ensuing consequence of the disease."" Related: Study finds brain receptor cell could be new target for Alzheimer s The work also suggests that combination therapy designed to prevent both the beta-amyloid plaque formation as well as pathological conversion of tau may provide optimal benefit for Alzheimer's disease, the researchers say. Their mouse model could be used to test new therapies. An estimated 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, according to 2016 statistics from the Alzheimer's Association.

""These are the first measurements of neural inputs between local circuits and faraway sites"", says Leopoldo Petreanu, who led the research. In doing so, Petreanu and co-authors Nicol s Morgenstern and Jacques Bourg have also discovered that the wiring of the brain is more complex than previously thought. Their results have been published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. ""We want to understand the structure of the brain, but the wiring diagram we have of the brain is still very rough"", says Petreanu. ""Except at the local level, we don't know how individual axons connect."" See Also: From transcription to function: mapping brain networks Thanks to a novel technique involving neural stimulation with laser light developed at their lab, the scientists were able to track the activity of individual axons, in the mouse brain, between a brain structure called the thalamus and the part of the visual cortex which receives, by way of the thalamus, the visual stimuli from the retinas. The visual cortex is structured in layers. One of them, called L4, is in fact the point of entry of most of the visual input into the cortex, and contains small groups of neurons that are highly and bidirectionally interconnected. It has been proposed that they may act as amplifiers of certain features of the visual signal enhancing the edges of objects in the outside world, for instance. But how this is achieved, and how they interact with remote inputs from the brain to integrate visual information is not known. Don't Miss: New mapping approach lets scientists zoom in and out as the brain processes sound Now, Petreanu and his team have found something that might give credit to this hypothesis: the fact that if two neurons in L4 are interconnected, an axon projecting from the thalamus to one of those neurons will ""bifurcate"" in order to also connect to the other. This means that these interconnected neurons receive the same input from the thalamus and are constantly signaling back and forth between them. Such a mechanism could generate an amplifying effect in these small neural circuits, according to Petreanu. There's more: once the incoming visual inputs travel along axons from cells in the thalamus to cells in L4 (where some processing has already taken place), they are then transmitted unidirectionally, for higher level processing, to another layer, called L2/3. Thus, the common view today is that ""visual processing is a serial process across layers"", says Petreanu. But that's not what the scientist now saw. In fact, they discovered that when two neurons were connected across these layers, an axon projecting from the thalamus to the neuron in L4 also ""bifurcated"" and connected, independently, to the neuron in L2/3. Learn More: New brain mapping reveals unknown cell types ""That's our main finding"", says Petreanu. The existence of these connections that ""skip a layer"" ensures that L2/3 not only receives processed visual inputs from L4, but also ""raw data"" from the thalamus. ""This might allow L2/3 cells to become very specialized in the detection of visual features"", he explains. ""Neural simulations on computers have shown that if you want an artificial neural network to be good at recognizing faces, you better have a layered structure and connections that 'skip a layer' "". The same may be true of the brain. ""This changes the way we understand how the brain receives information"", concludes Petreanu. And the same mechanism may be at work for other sensory inputs. The team now wants to determine if similar connection structures exist between different areas of the visual cortex. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

RA is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 1.3 million people in the United States and costs tens of billions of dollars annually to treat. The findings were announced by the Academic Medical Center/University of Amsterdam, the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and SetPoint Medical. See Also: Neurostimulation: What is being said in the media and academic literature? The publication highlights a human study designed to reduce symptoms of RA, cytokine levels and inflammation by stimulating the vagus nerve with a small implanted device.

""We have previously shown that targeting the inflammatory reflex may reduce inflammation in animal models and in vitro models of RA. The direct correlation between vagus nerve stimulation and the suppression of several key cytokines like TNF as well as reduced RA signs and symptoms demonstrates proof of mechanism, which might be relevant for other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases as well."" ""Our findings suggest a new approach to fighting diseases with bioelectronic medicines, which use electrical pulses to treat diseases currently treated with potent and relatively expensive drugs,"" said Anthony Arnold, Chief Executive Officer of SetPoint Medical. ""These results support our ongoing development of bioelectronic medicines designed to improve the lives of people suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases and give healthcare providers new and potentially safer treatment alternatives at a much lower total cost for the healthcare system."" ""This is a real breakthrough in our ability to help people suffering from inflammatory diseases,"" said co-author Kevin J. Tracey, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, discoverer of the inflammatory reflex and co-founder of SetPoint Medical. ""While we've previously studied animal models of inflammation, until now we had no proof that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can indeed inhibit cytokine production and reduce disease severity in humans. I believe this study will change the way we see modern medicine, helping us understand that our nerves can, with a little help, make the drugs that we need to help our body heal itself."" Learn More: New non-invasive form of vagus nerve stimulation works to treat depressionWhile focused on rheumatoid arthritis, the trial's results may have implications for patients suffering from other inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and others. In the study, a stimulation device was implanted on the vagus nerve during a surgical procedure, then activated and deactivated based on a set schedule to measure response over 84 days, with primary endpoints measured at day 42 using DAS28-CRP, a standard disease activity composite score for RA that includes counts of tender and swollen joints, patient's and physician's assessment of disease activity and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Of 17 patients with active RA in the study, several patients that had failed to respond to multiple therapies, including biologicals with different mechanisms of action, demonstrated robust responses. The findings indicate that active electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits TNF production in RA patients and significantly attenuates RA disease severity.

Yet genomic studies in mice have lagged behind those in humans. See Also: Origins of  rage  identified in brain in male animal model ""Genome-wide association studies matching genes to diseases and other traits have been a big deal in human genetics for the past decade,"" said Abraham Palmer, PhD, professor of psychiatry at University of California San Diego School of Medicine. ""But progress hasn't been so great in animal genetics. That's because researchers have mostly been using crosses between inbred strains, making it impossible to pinpoint specific genomic regions or individual genes associated with a trait. In addition, we didn't previously have good ways of genotyping animals in a cost-efficient way."" Now, in a study published in Nature Genetics, Palmer's team used 1,200 outbred mice, which are more similar to a natural population, to test a new cost-effective technique to search for specific genes linked with 66 different physical and behavioral traits. ""This is a system that could be used to discover genes associated with any complex trait a researcher is interested in, in any animal model,"" Palmer said. ""We can look at any trait and rapidly develop hypotheses about specific genes. It's like genome-wide association studies in humans, but less expensive. And we can look at certain traits that we can't in humans."" Previously, only large regions of a chromosome could be associated with a particular mouse trait or behavior. Palmer's method takes advantage of the superior mixing that is present in an outbred population to help drill down to specific genes using two steps: genotype-by-sequencing, which sequences about one percent of the mouse genome; and RNA sequencing, which identifies only genes turned ""on"" in a particular tissue, such as the brain. With this approach, the researchers found numerous associations between genes and the traits they are associated with. For example, they report that the mouse gene Azi2 is associated with the effects methamphetamines have on body movements, and that mouse gene Zmynd11 is associated with anxiety-like behavior. The findings may be clinically relevant, as humans have analogous genes, Palmer said.

Thirty-nine countries and territories in the Americas have been affected by the Zika epidemic, and it is expected that at least 4 million people will be infected by the end of the year. Scientists believe the virus is responsible for a host of brain defects in developing fetuses, including microcephaly, and has contributed to an uptick in cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome. There are not yet any approved Zika virus vaccines or antiviral medications, and ongoing mosquito control strategies have not been adequate to contain the spread of the virus. Researchers led by Jorge Osorio, a UW Madison professor of pathobiological sciences, and Scott O Neill of the the Eliminate Dengue Program (EDP) and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, are already releasing mosquitoes harboring the Wolbachia bacterium in pilot studies in Colombia, Brazil, Australia, Vietnam and Indonesia to help control the spread of dengue virus. Their work is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. An important feature of Wolbachia is that it is self-sustainable, making it a very low-cost approach for controlling mosquito-borne viral diseases that are affecting many tropical countries around the world.  In two of our initial study sites in Australia, approximately 90 percent of the mosquitoes continue to be infected with Wolbachia after initial release more than six years ago  says O Neill. EDP has now received additional endorsement from the World Health Organization s Vector Control Advisory Group to conduct further pilot studies and scale up in endemic areas. Wolbachia can be found in up to 60 percent of insects around the world, including butterflies and bees. While not typically found in the Aedes aegypti mosquito   the species that also transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses   O Neill discovered in the early 1990s that Wolbachia could be introduced to the mosquito in the lab and would prevent the mosquitoes from transmitting dengue virus. Zika virus belongs to the same family as dengue virus and Aliota and Osorio   with co-authors Stephen Penaido at SVM and Ivan Dario Velez, at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia   asked whether Wolbachia-harboring Aedes aegypti may also be effective against Zika virus. They were also interested in studying the mechanisms behind Zika virus infection and transmission in mosquitoes. In the study, the team infected mice with Zika virus originally isolated from a human patient and allowed mosquitoes from Medellin to feed on the mice either two or three days after they were infected. The mosquitoes were either harboring the same strain of the Wolbachia bacteria (called wMel) used in field studies or were Wolbachia-free and the mice had levels of virus in their blood similar to humans infected with Zika virus. An additional group of mosquitoes, both wild-type and Wolbachia-infected, was allowed to feed instead from a membrane containing sheep s blood spiked with a high concentration of Zika virus, per other standard laboratory studies. Four, seven, 10 and 17 days after the mosquitoes fed on Zika-virus-infected blood the researchers tested them for Zika virus infection, assessed whether the virus had disseminated   or spread to other tissues in the mosquito, and examined whether the virus made its way to the mosquito saliva, where it must be present to be transmitted.  The first site of replication for arboviruses is the mosquito midgut,  says Aliota.  It eventually leaves the midgut and is swept in their blood to secondary tissues and eventually to the salivary glands, where it replicates more and is eventually spit out.  They found that mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia were less likely to become infected with Zika virus after feeding on viral blood, and those that were infected were not capable of transmitting the virus in their saliva.  We saw reduced vector competence in Aedes aegypti with Wolbachia,  says Osorio, defined as the intrinsic ability of an insect to support the development or replication of a pathogen like a virus and then transmit it.  Mosquitoes with Wolbachia were less capable of harboring Zika virus, and though they do get infected with Zika, it is to a lesser extent than wild-type mosquitoes.  They also found that where mosquitoes got their blood meal   whether from mice or the membrane   impacted their infection and transmission status. This has implications for other laboratory-based Zika virus studies, Aliota says. Though mice had a lower concentration of virus in their blood than the blood contained in the membrane, mosquitoes that fed on the mice were infected at higher rates than those that were membrane-fed. The levels of virus found in the mice were also more similar to those seen in human infections. Non-Wolbachia-containing mosquitoes that acquired Zika virus from mice were also capable of transmitting the virus in a shorter number of days, and in less time than other studies have shown. Additionally, the researchers learned that a relatively low percentage of Zika-virus-transmitting mosquitoes may be sufficient to sustain an outbreak.  A surprisingly low percentage of mosquitoes are actually capable of transmitting the virus,  Aliota says,  but given the size of the outbreak, and that we think mosquitoes are the driver of the outbreak, the results were somewhat unexpected. It just goes to show you how much we still need to understand about the basic biology of this virus.  The study is one of the first to study Zika virus transmission dynamics using a living host, says Aliota. Importantly, the team also confirmed that the strain of Wolbachia used does not impact the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is important to the success of field studies. Once inside a mosquito, Wolbachia is passed from mother to offspring, so newborn mosquitoes will contain the bacteria and incorporate it into the wild population. EDP hopes to see greater than 80 percent of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in study areas harboring Wolbachia. According to Osorio, mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia in the study site in Medellin are close to reaching that number. Other studies show Wolbachia prevents mosquito transmission of yellow fever virus   which is causing an outbreak in Africa   and, in another studypublished in late April in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, Aliota, Osorio and their UW Madison and Universidad de Antioquia colleagues showed that Wolbachia prevents Colombian Aedes aegypti from transmitting chikungunya virus. Like Zika virus, chikungunya emerged out of Africa and spread to the Americas. It is now transmitted by mosquitoes on every inhabited continent around the globe, says Aliota. The virus can cause fever, chronic joint pain, fatigue, nausea and a rash. There is no cure or specific treatment. Aliota and Osorio continue to study Wolbachia in mosquitoes in relation to these viruses, monitoring for changes or developments that could affect ongoing field releases. So far the findings have been encouraging, Aliota says.  Our findings are complementary to results described earlier in the month in Cell Host & Microbe by our colleagues with EDP-Brazil, which is really exciting and really promising,  he says.","Published: July 4, 2016"

Using a super-sensitive cell-scanning device, researchers will analyse blood samples from patients with early-stage lung and bowel cancer to identify those who still have traces of cancer and so will be more likely to relapse. This will give doctors the opportunity to rapidly start second-line treatments. In early-stage lung cancer, as many as 50 per cent of patients relapse after surgery. Monitoring this  minimal residual disease  has transformed care in blood cancers like leukaemia, but techniques are not sensitive enough to monitor patients with  solid  tumours. The new technology will also allow researchers to analyse the cells they find in great detail, providing clues to the most effective therapy for each patient as their cancer re-emerges.  The partnership will use a platform, known as the high-definition single cell assay (HD-SCA*), developed by Professor Peter Kuhn at the University of Southern California. This identifies circulating tumour cells** (CTCs) far more sensitively than existing techniques by examining every single cell in a blood sample. Professor Caroline Dive and her team at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute at The University of Manchester, who has led the world in understanding these circulating tumour cells, will be using this technology for the first time in the UK. The US and the UK teams will build and operate identical laboratories with real-time sharing of research data and experimental procedures. Both research teams have a long track record in collaborative work across disciplines and laboratories. This will accelerate the development and testing of this technology in the clinic, getting it to patients around the world as quickly as possible. The US team will focus on bowel cancer, while the UK team   who are also part of the Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence   will lead the lung cancer research. As the teams refine and develop the technology, they eventually hope to use it to detect early signs of cancer in otherwise healthy people, ultimately leading to marked improvement in survival and cure.  Professor Caroline Dive, from the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, said:  The prospect of using blood samples to detect and track cancer   so-called liquid biopsies   is set to transform cancer care over the next few years. We are exhilarated by the prospect of this new partnership, and at bringing this exciting new technology to the UK.  Although early lung cancer can be treated successfully with surgery, patients face an anxious wait after treatment, and about half eventually relapse. Our new collaboration will let us spot those likely to relapse and get in early with other treatments, improving how we care for these patients, and delivering better outcomes, faster.  Professor Peter Kuhn, from the University of South California, said:  Our new technique, developed over the past 10 years, is able to detect cancer cells in the blood far more sensitively and characterise them far more deeply than ever before. We re excited to work with Caroline s team and accelerate its progression into routine use.  Professor Richard Marais, Director of the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute  Liquid biopsy research is a high priority in the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute and this exciting new collaboration will elevate our ongoing efforts as we seek to deliver personalised medicine for cancer patients at an earlier stage of their disease.  Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK s chief executive, said:  We re proud to be part of Vice President Biden s initiative and share his ambition to see progress accelerate so that more cancers are cured.

The autoimmune disease the team studied is called pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a condition in which a patient s own immune cells attack a protein called desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) that normally adheres skin cells.   Current therapies for autoimmune disease, such as prednisone and rituximab, suppress large parts of the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to potentially fatal opportunistic infections and cancers. The Penn researchers demonstrated their new technique by successfully treating an otherwise fatal autoimmune disease in a mouse model, without apparent off-target effects, which could harm healthy tissue.   This is a powerful strategy for targeting just autoimmune cells and sparing the good immune cells that protect us from infection,  said co-senior author Aimee S. Payne, MD, PhD, the Albert M. Kligman Associate Professor of Dermatology. Payne and her co-senior author Michael C. Milone, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, adapted the technique from the promising anti-cancer strategy by which T cells are engineered to destroy malignant cells in certain leukemias and lymphomas.  Our study effectively opens up the application of this anti-cancer technology to the treatment of a much wider range of diseases, including autoimmunity and transplant rejection,  Milone said. The key element in the new strategy is based on an artificial target-recognizing receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, which can be engineered into patients  T cells. In human trials, researchers remove some of patients  T cells through a process similar to dialysis and then engineer them in a laboratory to add the gene for the CAR so that the new receptor is expressed in the T cells. The new cells are then multiplied in the lab before re-infusing them into the patient. The T cells use their CAR receptors to bind to molecules on target cells, and the act of binding triggers an internal signal that strongly activates the T cells -- so that they swiftly destroy their targets. The basic CAR T cell concept was first described in the late 1980s, principally as an anti-cancer strategy, but technical challenges delayed its translation into successful therapies. Since 2011, though, experimental CAR T cell treatments for B cell leukemias and lymphomas -- cancers in which patients  healthy B cells turn cancerous -- have been successful in some patients for whom all standard therapies had failed. B cells, which produce antibodies, can also cause autoimmunity. Payne researches autoimmunity, and a few years ago, a postdoctoral researcher in her laboratory, Christoph T. Ellebrecht, MD, took an interest in CAR T cell technology as a potential weapon against B cell-related autoimmune diseases. Soon Payne s lab teamed up with Milone s, which studies CAR T cell technology, in the hope of finding a powerful new way to treat these ailments.  We thought we could adapt this technology that s really good at killing all B cells in the body to target specifically the B cells that make antibodies that cause autoimmune disease,  said Milone.  Targeting just the cells that cause autoimmunity has been the ultimate goal for therapy in this field,  noted Payne. A more disease-specific receptor In the new study, for which Ellebrecht was first author, the team took aim at pemphigus vulgaris. This condition occurs when a patient s antibodies attack molecules that normally keep skin cells together. When left untreated, PV leads to extensive skin blistering and is almost always fatal, but in recent decades the condition has been treatable with broadly immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab. To treat PV without causing broad immunosuppression, the Penn team designed an artificial CAR-type receptor that would direct patients  T cells to attack only the B cells producing harmful anti-Dsg3 antibodies. The team developed a  chimeric autoantibody receptor,  or CAAR, that displays fragments of the autoantigen Dsg3 -- the same fragments to which PV-causing antibodies and their B cells typically bind, as Payne s laboratory and others have shown in prior studies. The artificial receptor acts as a lure for the B cells that target Dsg3, bringing them into fatal contact with the therapeutic T cells. Testing many variants, the team eventually found an artificial receptor design that worked well in cell culture, enabling host T cells to efficiently destroy cells producing antibodies to desmoglein, including those derived from PV patients. The engineered T cells also performed successfully in a mouse model of PV, killing desmoglein-specific B cells and preventing blistering and other manifestations of autoimmunity in the animals.   We were able to show that the treatment killed all the Dsg3-specific B cells, a proof of concept that this approach works,  Payne said. T cell therapies can be complicated by many factors. But in these experiments, the Penn scientists  engineered cells maintained their potency despite the presence of anti-Dsg3 antibodies that might have swarmed their artificial receptors. In addition, there were no signs that the engineered T cells caused side effects by hitting the wrong cellular targets in the mice. The team now plans to test their treatment in dogs, which can also develop PV and often die from the disease.  If we can use this technology to cure PV safely in dogs, it would be a breakthrough for veterinary medicine, and would hopefully pave the way for trials of this therapy in human pemphigus patients,  Payne said. Also on the horizon for the Penn scientists are applications of CAAR T cell technology for other types of autoimmunity. The immune rejection that complicates organ transplants, and normally requires long-term immunosuppressive drug therapy, may also be treatable with CAAR T cell technology.  If you can identify a specific marker of a B cell that you want to target, then in principle this strategy can work,  Payne said.","Published: July 4, 2016"

Now scientists have found evidence that itaconate acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. These properties make itaconate promising for the treatment of pathologies caused by excessive inflammation or oxidative stress. Such conditions may be associated with cardiac ischemia, metabolic disorders and perhaps autoimmune diseases.  The work, which united scientists from Washington University in St. Louis, ITMO University, McGill University and Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, was based on the study of macrophages   immune system cells in charge of fighting pathogens. An important feature of macrophages is their ability to switch between different states depending on the concentration of various substances in the body. In total, there are three such states: M0   neutral, M1   pro-inflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory. M1 macrophages are the first who arrive to fight the infection. As they begin to swallow viruses and bacteria, an intense inflammatory process kicks in. This process may adversely affect the entire organism if the macrophages become overly diligent. Inflammation consumes energy resources of the organism and can lead to numerous complications or even death. That is why in order to mitigate the negative consequences of immune response, it is important to understand how we can reduce the excessive proinflammatory effect of macrophages. An in-depth study of macrophage metabolism during their transition from inactive to proinflammatory state helped researchers identify the substance that could suppress macrophage-related inflammations. Describing the working mechanism of this substance called itaconate became possible due to a complex map of metabolic pathways in macrophages that was developed by the group. Itaconate is produced by macrophages when they switch from M0 inactive state to M1 pro-inflammatory state. If the concentration of this substance increases to defined limit, macrophage activation falls.  Itaconate sets the bar controlling M1 macrophage formation,  says Alexey Sergushichev, one of the authors of the paper and PhD student at ITMO University.  Without this substance, the inflammation would increase more than required. In the future, with the help of itaconate, it will be possible to artificially manipulate the transition of macrophages from M0 to M1, meaning the possibility of restraining inflammations. The influence of itaconate on macrophages is a delicate mechanism that can ensure high selectivity of the immune system regulation.  Prior to the study, guesswork with respect to the function and origin of itaconate generated a lot of speculations. But the new study shows that itaconate plays the role of immune regulator. To understand how itaconate reduces the activity of immune cells, the researchers examined the so-called Krebs cycle, or tricarboxylic acid cycle and cellular respiration (processes of producing of vital substances and energy from the oxidation of glucose in cells). Having done so, the scientists identified two  bottlenecks  that can be influenced to reverse the reaction and send it another way. The Krebs cycle is preceded by signal transmission between cells through oxygen-sensitive pathways. Itaconate blocks the enzyme called Sdh (succinate dehydrogenase), which not only ensures the functioning of the tricarboxylic acid cycle but also links the cycle to cellular respiration and signaling pathways. Thus, itaconate acts on both functions of the Sdh enzyme, adjusting the cells  Krebs cycle and respiration. When the enzyme is blocked in macrophages, both processes become interrupted, and this impairs the cells  activation.  Noteworthy, itaconate acts as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent,  says Vicky Lampropoulou, the lead author of the paper and researcher at the laboratory of Maxim Artyomov at Washington University in St. Louis.  At the same time, itaconate is naturally produced by mammalian immune cells. These features make it attractive for use in adjuvant therapy for numerous diseases, in which excessive inflammation and oxidative stress associate with pathology, like heart ischemia, metabolic disorders and perhaps even autoimmunity.  The researchers have already demonstrated that they can use itaconate to reach the desired effect in living organisms. Experiments with mice have shown that the substance reduces damage after heart attack, acting by the same mechanism of locking the Sdh enzyme. However, according to the scientists, more work is needed to successfully apply the method to humans. ","Published: July 4, 2016"

Based on a recent study, monitoring PCT levels over 4 days (96 hours) can help doctors determine which septic patients are at the greatest risk of death, enabling them to adjust or intensify the medical care for those patients. As a pioneer dedicated to improving patient safety and infection control practices, bioM rieux was the first company to launch an automated test measuring PCT in the U.S.. Today, the VIDAS  B R A H M S PCT  test is the market leader for sepsis prognosis. PCT was originally cleared for use in the first day following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and this expanded claim demonstrates the usefulness of PCT levels which are monitored serially over 96 hours. Monitoring serial PCT levels over 96 hours, along with ongoing clinical assessment and other laboratory tests, will provide additional information to the clinician to help with a more robust prognosis and management of patients with sepsis and septic shock. This combination of tools and data will enable physicians to assess the risk of progression and ultimately the risk of mortality in the septic patient. Armed with this vital prognostic information, physicians can more appropriately manage and aggressively support and treat those with elevated risk.  In many patients, it can be very difficult to diagnose sepsis up until the moment of obvious shock,  said Devendra Amin, MD, FCCM, intensive care physician and medical director of Critical Care Services at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, FL.  The expanded indication for PCT will allow us to obtain vital information prior to the admission to the ICU and will give us vital information about the patient s prognosis, risk of mortality, response to treatment and likelihood of survival.  As part of the FDA filing, bioM rieux submitted equivalence results of the Thermo Fisher Scientific s Procalcitonin MOnitoring SEpsis Study (MOSES), which tracked PCT levels of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients whose PCT levels decreased by 80 percent or more during the 96 hour timeframe of the study had a significantly lower risk of 28-day mortality compared to those whose PCT measurements decreased less than 80 percent over 96 hours.  The study demonstrates that for patients diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock, failure of blood concentrations of PCT to decrease over 96 hours is a strong predictor of mortality over and above clinical indicators,  said Mark Miller, Chief Medical Officer at bioM rieux.  Measuring PCT at clinical presentation and serially over 4 days will provide clinicians with high medical value information to help them identify patients who are at greatest risk of mortality and ultimately can result in improved, more targeted and intensified patient care and better medical outcomes .","Published: July 4, 2016"

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/testing-for-malaria-or-cancer-at-home-211361,Testing for Malaria or Cancer at Home Chemist develops tech to save lives in rural Africa  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.What if testing yourself for cancer or other diseases were as easy as testing your blood sugar or taking a home pregnancy test? In a few years, it might be. Chemists at The Ohio State University are developing paper strips that detect diseases including cancer and malaria for a cost of 50 cents per strip. The idea, explained Abraham Badu-Tawiah, is that people could apply a drop of blood to the paper at home and mail it to a laboratory on a regular basis and see a doctor only if the test comes out positive. The researchers found that the tests were accurate even a month after the blood sample was taken, proving they could work for people living in remote areas. The assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Ohio State conceived of the papers as a way to get cheap malaria diagnoses into the hands of people in rural Africa and southeast Asia, where the disease kills hundreds of thousands of people and infects hundreds of millions every year. But in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, he and his colleagues report that the test can be tailored to detect any disease for which the human body produces antibodies, including ovarian cancer and cancer of the large intestine. The patent-pending technology could bring disease diagnosis to people who need it most those who don t have regular access to a doctor or can t afford regular in-person visits, Badu-Tawiah said.  We want to empower people. If you care at all about your health and you have reason to worry about a condition, then you don t want to wait until you get sick to go to the hospital. You could test yourself as often as you want,  he said. The technology resembles today s  lab on a chip  diagnostics, but instead of plastic, the  chip  is made from sheets of plain white paper stuck together with two-sided adhesive tape and run through a typical ink jet printer. Instead of regular ink, however, the researchers use wax ink to trace the outline of channels and reservoirs on the paper. The wax penetrates the paper and forms a waterproof barrier to capture the blood sample and keep it between layers. One 8.5-by-11-inch sheet of paper can hold dozens of individual tests that can then be cut apart into strips, each a little larger than a postage stamp.  To get tested, all a person would have to do is put a drop of blood on the paper strip, fold it in half, put it in an envelope and mail it,  Badu-Tawiah said. The technology works differently than other paper-based medical diagnostics like home pregnancy tests, which are coated with enzymes or gold nanoparticles to make the paper change color. Instead, the paper contains small synthetic chemical probes that carry a positive charge. It s these  ionic  probes that allow ultra-sensitive detection by a handheld mass spectrometer.  Enzymes are picky. They have to be kept at just the right temperature and they can t be stored dry or exposed to light,  Badu-Tawiah said.  But the ionic probes are hardy. They are not affected by light, temperature, humidity even the heat in Africa can t do anything to them. So you can mail one of these strips to a hospital and know that it will be readable when it gets there.  The chemists designed ionic probes to tag specific antibodies that extract the disease biomarker from the blood and onto the paper chip. Once they are extracted, the chemicals stay unchanged until the paper is dipped in an ammonia solution at the laboratory. There, someone peels the paper layers apart and holds them in front of a mass spectrometer, which detects the presence of the probes based on their atomic characteristics and, by extension, the presence of biomarkers in an infected person s blood. Badu-Tawiah and postdoctoral researchers Suming Chen and Qiongqiong Wan successfully demonstrated that they could detect protein biomarkers from the most common malaria parasite,Plasmodium falciparum, which is most prevalent in Africa. They also successfully detected the protein biomarker for ovarian cancer, known as cancer antigen 125, and the carcinoembryonic antigen, which is a marker for cancer of the large intestine, among other cancers. They worked with former doctoral student Yang Song in the lab of colleague Vicki Wysocki, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to study how the probes stick to the antibodies with a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Wysocki is the Ohio Eminent Scholar of Macromolecular Structure and Function and director of the Campus Chemical Instrument Center at Ohio State. After confirming that their tests worked, Badu-Tawiah and his team stored the strips away and re-tested them every few days to see if the signal detected by the mass spectrometer would fade over time. It didn t. The signal was just as strong after 30 days as on day one, meaning that the disease proteins were stable and detectable even after a month. Since the antibody strips survive more than long enough to reach a lab by mail, they could open up a whole new world of medical care for people in rural communities even in the United States, Badu-Tawiah said. Even for people living in the city, testing themselves at home would save money compared to going to the doctor. In the US, he said, the tests would be ideal for people who have a family history of cancer or have successfully undergone cancer treatment. Instead of waiting to visit a doctor every six months to confirm that they are still in remission, they could test themselves from home more frequently. In the case of malaria, the human and financial costs are high, especially in Africa. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by parasites. The infection starts with flulike symptoms that can develop into kidney failure or other complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there were 214 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2015, and 438,000 people died mostly children in Africa.  In Africa, malaria is so common that whenever you get feverish, the first thing you think is,  Oh, it s probably malaria,  Badu-Tawiah said. While the prototype test strips at Ohio State cost about 50 cents each to produce, those costs would likely go down with mass production, he said. The greatest cost of using the strips would fall to urban medical facilities, which would have to purchase mass spectrometers to read the results. Modelportable instruments can cost $100,000 but less expensive handheld mass specs are under development. Still, Badu-Tawiah pointed out, an initial investment in mass specs would be more than offset by the potential boon to Africa s economy. UNICEF estimates that malaria costs the continent $12 billion in lost worker productivity every year. In the United States, where mass spectrometers are more common, the cost savings would come in the form of reduced insurance use and fewer out-of-pocket expenses from going to the doctor less often.  Although this approach requires an initial investment, we believe the low-cost paper-based consumable devices will make it sustainable,  Badu-Tawiah said.  We can set one small instrument at a grocery store, then sell the paper strips for just 50 cents per test. The same for Africa, and perhaps much cheaper there.","Published: July 4, 2016"

Following initial clearance in March for detection and differentiation of carbapenemase genes in pure bacterial isolates, the latest clearance extends use of the assay to the analysis of direct rectal swab specimens, and positions Xpert Carba-R as a valuable tool for the identification of colonized patients and as an aid to infection control efforts, both of which Cepheid believes are needed to escalate the fight against antimicrobial resistance. ""The number of global incidents associated with these deadly bacteria is surging, and is frequently associated with high morbidity and mortality, in addition to increased hospital costs1,"" said David Persing, M.D., Ph.D., Cepheid's Chief Medical and Technology Officer. ""Xpert Carba-R delivers a highly accurate result in as little as 48 minutes, enabling clinicians to assess high-risk patients for colonization status at or prior to admission, to enact full preventative measures as necessary to reduce the risk to the patient, the broader patient population, and hospital staff. In contrast, traditional enriched culture methods typically take 3-5 days."" The CDC recommends comprehensive infection control measures for patients who are colonized or infected with carbapenemase-producing organisms2, known as CPOs or 'superbugs'. CPOs are often resistant to many of the beta-lactam antibiotics used for empiric therapy for gram-negative infections, in addition to other classes of antibiotics. ""Surveillance is a key infection prevention activity for monitoring and controlling the spread of CPOs in hospitals and long term care facilities,"" said Lance Peterson, M.D., Director of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Research, NorthShore University Health System. ""Xpert Carba-R is the first real time PCR test for CPOs in the United States that can be performed on demand, thus facilitating surveillance studies."" Xpert Carba-R adds to the portfolio of Xpert tests offered by Cepheid to help infection control professionals fight antimicrobial resistance including MRSA, C. difficile, VRE, and MTB-RIF. Xpert Carba-R runs on Cepheid's GeneXpert System, the world's leading molecular diagnostic platform with more than 10,000 systems installed globally. Xpert Carba-R with the extended claim will begin shipping in July.","Published: July 2, 2016"

Previous studies have shown bacteria in the gut release a compound called propionate when they digest the fibre inulin, which can signal to the brain to reduce appetite. However the inulin-propionate ester supplement releases much more propionate in the intestines than inulin alone. After drinking the milkshakes, the participants in the current study underwent an MRI scan, where they were shown pictures of various low or high calorie foods such as salad, fish and vegetables or chocolate, cake and pizza. The team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward - but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These areas, called the caudate and the nucleus accumbens, found in the centre of the brain, have previously been linked to food cravings and the motivation to want a food. The volunteers also had to rate how appealing they found the foods. The results showed when they drank the milkshake with the inulin-propionate ester supplement they rated the high calorie foods as less appealing. In a second part of the study, which is published in July edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the volunteers were given a bowl of pasta with tomato sauce, and asked to eat as much as they like. When participants drank the inulin-propionate ester, they ate 10 per cent less pasta than when they drank the milkshake that contained inulin alone. In a previous research study by the same team, published in 2013, they found that overweight volunteers who added the inulin-propionate ester supplement to their food every day, gained less weight over six months compared to volunteers who added only inulin to their meals. Professor Gary Frost, senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said:  Our previous findings showed that people who ate this ingredient gained less weight - but we did not know why. This study is filling in a missing bit of the jigsaw - and shows that this supplement can decrease activity in brain areas associated with food reward at the same time as reducing the amount of food they eat.  He added that eating enough fibre to naturally produce similar amounts of propionate would be difficult:  The amount of inulin-propionate ester used in this study was 10g - which previous studies show increases propionate production by 2.5 times. To get the same increase from fibre alone, we would need to eat around 60g a day. At the moment, the UK average is 15g."" Claire Byrne, a PhD researcher also from the Department of Medicine explained that using inulin-propionate ester as a food ingredient may help prevent weight gain: ""If we add this to foods it could reduce the urge to consume high calorie foods."" She added that some people's gut bacteria may naturally produce more propionate than others, which may be why some people seem more naturally predisposed to gain weight. Dr Tony Goldstone, co-senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine added:  This study adds to our previous brain imaging studies in people who have had gastric bypass surgery for obesity. These show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general, but also change how the brain responds when they see high-calorie foods, and how appealing they find the foods to be.  Dr Douglas Morrison, author of the paper from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre at the University of Glasgow, commented:  We developed inulin-propionate ester to investigate the role of propionate produced by the gut microbiota in human health. This study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice. This study also sheds new light on how diet, the gut microbiome and health are inextricably linked adding to our understanding of how feeding our gut microbes with dietary fibre is important for healthy living.  The research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Imperial Innovations, the College's technology transfer partner, has filed a patent on the underlying technology and is seeking commercial partners.

The first steps in visual processing take place in the retina, which is a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye containing more than 70 distinct types of nerve cells. Our visual system processes light stimuli to extract important information about the visual world, such as movement, orientation and colour. This information is processed at the cellular level before being transmitted via the optic nerve to the brain, where a visual image is formed. See Also: Which dot will they hunt? Prey is recognized even by the zebrafish retina Although some of the visual circuits underlying this image processing have been identified in previous research, this new study is the first to reveal the cellular and molecular building blocks in the retina which enable us to detect oriented visual stimuli, a feature of visual perception described as 'orientation selectivity'. Orientation selectivity is known to be important for various perceptual processes, including whether something is horizontal or vertical, which in humans is crucial for recognising faces. Published in Current Biology, the study shows how 'orientation selectivity' is orchestrated in the retina. The researchers studied larval zebrafish, which has become an organism of choice for many scientists because its biological processes are relatively similar to humans. The development of zebrafish is also very fast, going from fertilised egg to larvae in five days - at which point they have a fully formed visual system, equivalent in overall structure and function to that of humans. Crucially, larval zebrafish are also transparent, which means scientists can observe development and cellular processes as they happen, without using invasive experimental methods. The zebrafish were shown videos featuring shapes of different orientation, while at the same time their brain activity was measured. The researchers analysed levels of cellular activity in neurons of the visual system by recording the fluorescence of calcium indicators (i.e. the more fluorescent the indicators were, the higher the level of neural activity). By doing so, it was possible to identify specific neurons in the retina and measure how they are activated by oriented stimuli. Don't Miss: Bug eyes: Tiny glasses confirm 3D vision in insects Paride Antinucci, first author from the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology at King's College London, said: 'We heavily rely on our visual system to understand and interact with the world. A key property of visual perception is the ability of neural cells to selectively respond to oriented visual stimuli, a property called orientation selectivity. Our study reveals, for the first time, specific cell types and mechanisms responsible for the emergence of this property in the retina.' Previous findings from the research team have shown a functional link between a protein called Teneurin-3 and orientation selectivity in the retina. This protein is thought to act as a recognition molecule at the communication junctions of neurons, called synapses. In this new study using novel genome editing technology, the researchers also discovered that mutating the Teneurin-3 gene led to a loss of orientation selectivity in neurons of the retina. More specifically, the retinal output neurons that send visual information to the brain, called ganglion cells, lost their ability to 'see' certain orientations when Teneurin-3 was not present. The researchers also found that the structure of these special neurons played a crucial role in this process. The elongated shape of these cells directly determines if they are responding to oriented visual input and along which axis (i.e. vertical or horizontal). This 'shape-determines-function' mechanism is an important finding to explain visual processing. Dr Robert Hindges, senior author from the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology at King's, said: 'For almost 20 years I've been studying topography - that is, how we see what is up and what is down, what is left and what is right. Today we are focusing on the investigation of visual processing in much more detail with the aid of zebrafish studies. 'Our new research indicates that specifically shaped cells in the retina are activated when visual stimuli are horizontal, and other cells fire when they are vertical.' Learn More: Brain plasticity after vision loss has an  on-off switch  Dr Hindges added: 'These findings are important on two levels. Firstly, we finally get closer to understanding how different visual signals are shaped already in the retina before being transmitted to the brain. Secondly, our results help to explain how these types of proteins could work also in other contexts. Large genetic screens have previously shown that mutations in different members of the Teneurin gene family are strongly linked with mental health issues, bipolar disorder and epilepsy. We therefore believe our basic findings on the roles of these synaptic proteins could enhance our understanding of the development of these disorders.

One promising strategy for the treatment of these solid tumors and others is RNA interference (RNAi) nanotechnology, but delivering RNAi agents to the sites of tumors has proved challenging. Investigators at Brigham and Women s Hospital, together with collaborators from Massachusetts General Hospital, have developed an innovative nanoplatform that allows them to effectively deliver RNAi agents to the sites of cancer and suppress tumor growth and reduce metastasis in preclinical models of ATC. Their results appear this week in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  We call this a  theranostic  platform because it brings a therapy and a diagnostic together in one functional nanoparticle,  said co-senior author Jinjun Shi, PhD, assistant professor of Anesthesia in the Anesthesia Department.  We expect this study to pave the way for the development of theranostic platforms for image-guided RNAi delivery to advanced cancers.  RNAi, the discovery of which won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 10 years ago, allows researchers to silence mutated genes, including those upon which cancers depend to grow and survive and metastasize. Many ATCs depend upon mutations in the commonly mutated cancer gene BRAF. By delivering RNAi agents that specifically target and silence this mutated gene, the investigators hoped to stop both the growth and the spread of ATC, which often metastasizes to the lungs and other organs. When RNAi is delivered on its own, it is usually broken down by enzymes or filtered out by the kidneys before it reaches tumor cells. Even when RNAi agents make it as far as the tumor, they are often unable to penetrate or are rejected by the cancer cells. To overcome these barriers, the investigators used nanoparticles to deliver the RNAi molecules to ATC tumors. In addition, they coupled the nanoparticles with a near-infrared fluorescent polymer, which allowed them to see where the nanoparticles accumulated in a mouse model of ATC. By measuring the glow from the near-infrared fluorescent polymer, the team verified that nanoparticles had reached the primary site of ATC in the thyroid. The team found that the nanoparticles circulated for long periods of time in the blood stream and accumulated at high concentrations in the tumors. In addition, the team reports evidence that BRAF had been successfully silenced at these sites. They found that, for cells grown in a dish and treated with the nanoparticles containing RNAi agents, cell growth was drastically slowed and the number of cancer cells that were able to migrate decreased by as much as 15-fold. In mouse models, tumor growth was also slowed and fewer metastases formed.  In order to translate the new platform into clinical applications, the research team notes the importance of having an imaging diagnostic that will allow them to quickly assess which patients most likely to benefit from RNAi nanotherapeutics.  Most patients who present to surgeons with anaplastic thyroid cancer are out of options and this new research gives these patients some options. Having an approach that allows us to rapidly visualize and simultaneously deliver a targeted therapy could be critical for the efficient treatment of this disease and other lethal cancers with a poor prognosis,  said co-senior author, Sareh Parangi, MD, associate professor in the MGH Department of Surgery.","Published: July 1, 2016"

Publishing in Science, researchers at the Buck Institute harnessed a naturally-occurring and evolutionarily ancient anti-inflammatory mechanism that repaired the eye and significantly enhanced the success of retinal regenerative therapies in mice.  The results could be particularly significant for chronic inflammatory diseases of the eye, including macular degeneration.  The group discovered a previously unknown immunomodulatory property of an evolutionarily conserved factor, MANF (Mesencephalic Astrocyte-derived Neurotrophic Factor). MANF converts inflammatory immune cells into repairing immune cells; in this study it profoundly improved the endogenous repair capacity of the retina in both flies and mice. Strikingly, when the researchers used MANF as a supplement while transplanting photoreceptors into congenitally blind mice, MANF increased the efficiency of integration and accelerated and improved the recovery of visual function.  MANF promotes healing and helps create a microenvironment conducive to successful transplantation,  said Buck faculty and co-senior author Deepak Lamba, PhD, MBBS, who is among those developing stem cell technologies to treat degenerative eye diseases.  Lamba says that even though researchers around the world have successfully transplanted retinal stem cells in mice that success has not benefited the millions of people who suffer from vision problems related to retinal degeneration, because only about 1 percent of the transplanted cells survive and integrate over time.  We are hoping to turn that statistic around,  he said. Lamba and co-senior author Heinrich Jasper, PhD, say the research also raises the possibility of using MANF as a treatment early in the disease process as a way of preventing further symptoms from developing, noting that they used MANF to protect photoreceptors in three mouse models of photoreceptor degeneration.  Our hope is that MANF will be useful for treatment of inflammatory conditions in many disease contexts,  said Jasper, who is Chief Scientific Officer at the Buck Institute.  Focusing on immune modulation to promote a healthy repair response to tissue damage rather than a deleterious inflammatory response is a new frontier in aging research.  The initial discovery that fueled the project was made in genetic studies of fruit flies in the Jasper lab. Lead author Joana Neves, PhD, a Glenn Foundation for Medical Research postdoctoral research fellow who shares an appointment in both the Jasper and Lamba labs, found that MANF was secreted by the immune cells in the fly in response to damage to the retina. MANF then acted on the same cells to promote their transition from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory repair cells, promoting retinal repair. Once the team determined that MANF acts similarly in mammals, the research moved into mice. Jasper says the research demonstrates that combining genetic studies in invertebrates and vertebrates can lead to the rapid identification of new factors with promising therapeutic potential.  The early work in the fly allowed us to identify genes that led us to an immune modulator that is conserved among many species,  said Jasper.  We were able to do that work relatively quickly at a low cost and it helped us set up the pre-clinical work that is now taking place in mice and human cells. ","Published: July 1, 2016"

Using the sensors, the researchers hope to design lightweight, inexpensive radio-frequency identification (RFID) badges to be used for personal safety and security. Such badges could be worn by soldiers on the battlefield to rapidly detect the presence of chemical weapons   such as nerve gas or choking agents   and by people who work around hazardous chemicals prone to leakage.    Soldiers have all this extra equipment that ends up weighing way too much and they can t sustain it,  says Timothy Swager, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Chemistry and lead author on a paper describing the sensors that was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.  We have something that would weigh less than a credit card. And [soldiers] already have wireless technologies with them, so it s something that can be readily integrated into a soldier s uniform that can give them a protective capacity.  The sensor is a circuit loaded with carbon nanotubes, which are normally highly conductive but have been wrapped in an insulating material that keeps them in a highly resistive state. When exposed to certain toxic gases, the insulating material breaks apart, and the nanotubes become significantly more conductive. This sends a signal that s readable by a smartphone with near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows devices to transmit data over short distances. The sensors are sensitive enough to detect less than 10 parts per million of target toxic gases in about five seconds.  We are matching what you could do with benchtop laboratory equipment, such as gas chromatographs and spectrometers, that is far more expensive and requires skilled operators to use,  Swager says. Moreover, the sensors each cost about a nickel to make; roughly 4 million can be made from about 1 gram of the carbon nanotube materials.  You really can t make anything cheaper,  Swager says.  That s a way of getting distributed sensing into many people s hands.  The paper s other co-authors are from Swager s lab: Shinsuke Ishihara, a postdoc who is also a member of the International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics at the National Institute for Materials Science, in Japan; and PhD students Joseph Azzarelli and Markrete Krikorian.  Wrapping nanotubes In recent years, Swager s lab has developed other inexpensive, wireless sensors, called chemiresistors, that have detected spoiled meat and the ripeness of fruit, among other things. All are designed similarly, with carbon nanotubes that are chemically modified, so their ability to carry an electric current changes when exposed to a target chemical. This time, the researchers designed sensors highly sensitive to  electrophilic,  or electron-loving, chemical substances, which are often toxic and used for chemical weapons. To do so, they created a new type of metallo-supramolecular polymer, a material made of metals binding to polymer chains. The polymer acts as an insulation, wrapping around each of the sensor s tens of thousands of single-walled carbon nanotubes, separating them and keeping them highly resistant to electricity. But electrophilic substances trigger the polymer to disassemble, allowing the carbon nanotubes to once again come together, which leads to an increase in conductivity. In their study, the researchers drop-cast the nanotube/polymer material onto gold electrodes, and exposed the electrodes to diethyl chlorophosphate, a skin irritant and reactive simulant of nerve gas. Using a device that measures electric current, they observed a 2,000 percent increase in electrical conductivity after five seconds of exposure. Similar conductivity increases were observed for trace amounts of numerous other electrophilic substances, such as thionyl chloride (SOCl2), a reactive simulant in choking agents. Conductivity was significantly lower in response to common volatile organic compounds, and exposure to most nontarget chemicals actually increased resistivity. Creating the polymer was a delicate balancing act but critical to the design, Swager says. As a polymer, the material needs to hold the carbon nanotubes apart. But as it disassembles, its individual monomers need to interact more weakly, letting the nanotubes regroup.  We hit this sweet spot where it only works when it s all hooked together,  Swager says. Resistance is readable To build their wireless system, the researchers created an NFC tag that turns on when its electrical resistance dips below a certain threshold. Smartphones send out short pulses of electromagnetic fields that resonate with an NFC tag at radio frequency, inducing an electric current, which relays information to the phone. But smartphones can t resonate with tags that have a resistance higher than 1 ohm. The researchers applied their nanotube/polymer material to the NFC tag s antenna. When exposed to 10 parts per million of SOCl2 for five seconds, the material s resistance dropped to the point that the smartphone could ping the tag. Basically, it s an  on/off indicator  to determine if toxic gas is present, Swager says. According to the researchers, such a wireless system could be used to detect leaks in Li-SOCl2 (lithium thionyl chloride) batteries, which are used in medical instruments, fire alarms, and military systems. Alexander Star, a professor of chemistry and bioengineering and clinical and translational science at the University of Pittsburgh, says the researchers  design for a wireless sensor (or dosimeter) for electrophilic substances could improve soldier safety.  The authors were able to synthesize a [carbon nanotube] composite sensitive to   a class of chemicals of high interest for sensing,  Star says.  This type of device architecture is important for real-life application, due to the fact that a chemical weapon dosimeter worn by military and security personnel requires rapid reading.  The next step, Swager says, is to test the sensors on live chemical agents, outside of the lab, which are more dispersed and harder to detect, especially at trace levels. In the future, there s also hope for developing a mobile app that could make more sophisticated measurements of the signal strength of an NFC tag: Differences in the signal will mean higher or lower concentrations of a toxic gas.  But creating new cell phone apps is a little beyond us right now,  Swager says.  We re chemists.

Credit: Paul Foster, Penn Medicine In a study with potentially major implications for the future treatment of autoimmunity and related conditions, scientists from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have found a way to remove the subset of antibody-making cells that cause an autoimmune disease, without harming the rest of the immune system. The autoimmune disease the team studied is called pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a condition in which a patient s own immune cells attack a protein called desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) that normally adheres skin cells.   Current therapies for autoimmune disease, such as prednisone and rituximab, suppress large parts of the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to potentially fatal opportunistic infections and cancers. The Penn researchers demonstrated their new technique by successfully treating an otherwise fatal autoimmune disease in a mouse model, without apparent off-target effects, which could harm healthy tissue. The results are published in an online First Release paper in Science.  This is a powerful strategy for targeting just autoimmune cells and sparing the good immune cells that protect us from infection,  said co-senior author Aimee S. Payne, MD, PhD, the Albert M. Kligman Associate Professor of Dermatology. Payne and her co-senior author Michael C. Milone, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, adapted the technique from the promising anti-cancer strategy by which T cells are engineered to destroy malignant cells in certain leukemias and lymphomas.  Our study effectively opens up the application of this anti-cancer technology to the treatment of a much wider range of diseases, including autoimmunity and transplant rejection,  Milone said. The key element in the new strategy is based on an artificial target-recognizing receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, which can be engineered into patients  T cells. In human trials, researchers remove some of patients  T cells through a process similar to dialysis and then engineer them in a laboratory to add the gene for the CAR so that the new receptor is expressed in the T cells. The new cells are then multiplied in the lab before re-infusing them into the patient. The T cells use their CAR receptors to bind to molecules on target cells, and the act of binding triggers an internal signal that strongly activates the T cells -- so that they swiftly destroy their targets. The basic CAR T cell concept was first described in the late 1980s, principally as an anti-cancer strategy, but technical challenges delayed its translation into successful therapies. Since 2011, though, experimental CAR T cell treatments for B cell leukemias and lymphomas -- cancers in which patients  healthy B cells turn cancerous -- have been successful in some patients for whom all standard therapies had failed. B cells, which produce antibodies, can also cause autoimmunity. Payne researches autoimmunity, and a few years ago, a postdoctoral researcher in her laboratory, Christoph T. Ellebrecht, MD, took an interest in CAR T cell technology as a potential weapon against B cell-related autoimmune diseases. Soon Payne s lab teamed up with Milone s, which studies CAR T cell technology, in the hope of finding a powerful new way to treat these ailments.  We thought we could adapt this technology that s really good at killing all B cells in the body to target specifically the B cells that make antibodies that cause autoimmune disease,  said Milone.  Targeting just the cells that cause autoimmunity has been the ultimate goal for therapy in this field,  noted Payne. A more disease-specific receptor In the new study, for which Ellebrecht was first author, the team took aim at pemphigus vulgaris. This condition occurs when a patient s antibodies attack molecules that normally keep skin cells together. When left untreated, PV leads to extensive skin blistering and is almost always fatal, but in recent decades the condition has been treatable with broadly immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab. To treat PV without causing broad immunosuppression, the Penn team designed an artificial CAR-type receptor that would direct patients  T cells to attack only the B cells producing harmful anti-Dsg3 antibodies. The team developed a  chimeric autoantibody receptor,  or CAAR, that displays fragments of the autoantigen Dsg3 -- the same fragments to which PV-causing antibodies and their B cells typically bind, as Payne s laboratory and others have shown in prior studies. The artificial receptor acts as a lure for the B cells that target Dsg3, bringing them into fatal contact with the therapeutic T cells. Testing many variants, the team eventually found an artificial receptor design that worked well in cell culture, enabling host T cells to efficiently destroy cells producing antibodies to desmoglein, including those derived from PV patients. The engineered T cells also performed successfully in a mouse model of PV, killing desmoglein-specific B cells and preventing blistering and other manifestations of autoimmunity in the animals.   We were able to show that the treatment killed all the Dsg3-specific B cells, a proof of concept that this approach works,  Payne said. T cell therapies can be complicated by many factors. But in these experiments, the Penn scientists  engineered cells maintained their potency despite the presence of anti-Dsg3 antibodies that might have swarmed their artificial receptors. In addition, there were no signs that the engineered T cells caused side effects by hitting the wrong cellular targets in the mice. The team now plans to test their treatment in dogs, which can also develop PV and often die from the disease.  If we can use this technology to cure PV safely in dogs, it would be a breakthrough for veterinary medicine, and would hopefully pave the way for trials of this therapy in human pemphigus patients,  Payne said. Also on the horizon for the Penn scientists are applications of CAAR T cell technology for other types of autoimmunity. The immune rejection that complicates organ transplants, and normally requires long-term immunosuppressive drug therapy, may also be treatable with CAAR T cell technology.  If you can identify a specific marker of a B cell that you want to target, then in principle this strategy can work,  Payne said.","Published: July 1, 2016"

As the cell divides, these endcaps degrade, causing the cell to age   and it is believed this degradation may lead to some aspects of aging in humans. UT Southwestern scientists hope to use knowledge of telomeres to slow or stop cells from aging, or to potentially help stop the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells that maintain their telomeres. Finding the best and most sensitive methods for measuring telomeres is an important initial step that could eventually enable scientists to encourage healthy cell growth or, in the case of cancer, limit or halt the cell growth.  Probes generated using this new approach significantly enhance the sensitivity of telomere length measurements,  explained Dr. Jerry Shay, Professor of Cell Biology, who along with his postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Tsung-Po Lai, developed the new method together with Dr. Woodring Wright, Professor of Cell Biology and Internal Medicine. Dr. Shay and Dr. Wright, who hold The Southland Financial Corporation Distinguished Chair in Geriatrics, are members of UT Southwestern s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, and together direct a joint laboratory studying telomere biology. Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes, which package genetic information to pass from parents to children. As the cell divides, these endcaps help keep the genetic information stable and prevent the chromosomes from fusing together. But as cells divide, the telomeres shorten and, eventually, trigger DNA damage that in conjunction with other factors can lead to progression of aging and an increased chance of cancer emerging. Scientists are interested in understanding this cellular aging process to create an  immortal cell,  which could continue to create new cells without degrading and that could have important implications for diseases related to aging. In reverse, controlling the cellular aging process could accelerate the mortality of cancer cells. If telomeres in cancer cells shorten, this action could prevent the cancer cells from dividing uncontrollably in their early stages of development, slowing or halting cancer progression. In the event that a tumor has already developed, anti-telomerase therapy might be administered to prevent relapse. The first step is developing the ability to accurately measure telomeres. Radioactive probes often used for measuring lengths are less stable, require long exposure times, and result in hazardous waste disposal requirements and other potential safety issues. A popular nonradioactive alternative called DIG (digoxigenin) probes requires relatively large amounts of genomic DNA and is less sensitive. The new nonradioactive method developed by the researchers here uses multiple DIG molecules, which increases both the sensitivity and stability of telomere detection.","Published: July 1, 2016"

Under the terms of the agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Transition Therapeutics security holders will receive approximately 6.4 million shares of OPKO common stock. Based on the moving average price of OPKO common stock for the five trading days preceding the signing of the agreement, the transaction is valued at approximately US$60 million, or US$1.55 per share of Transition Therapeutics common stock, based on current outstanding shares. The companies expect the transaction to close during the second half of 2016, subject to approval of Transition Therapeutics stockholders and other customary conditions. The Transition Therapeutics clinical portfolio includes: TT401, a once or twice weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We believe TT401 to be the most clinically advanced drug candidate among the new class of GLP1-glucagon receptor dual agonists. In a recently completed phase 2 study of 420 patients with type 2 diabetes, subjects receiving the highest dose of TT401 peptide once weekly demonstrated significantly superior weight loss compared with currently approved extended release exenatide and placebo after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. TT401 also provided a reduction in HbA1c, a marker of sugar metabolism, similar to exenatide at weeks 12 and 24. TT401 strengthens OPKO's existing pipeline of oxyntomodulin drug candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. OPKO's MOD-6031, currently in a phase 1 study, is a once weekly oxyntomodulin with a proprietary delivery system to slowly release the natural oxyntomodulin, which allows the molecule to penetrate the blood brain barrier. The potential of MOD-6031 to interact with CNS, as well as peripheral receptors, is expected to mimic the natural effect of oxyntomodulin for its effects on satiety and weight loss. TT701 is a once daily oral selective androgen receptor modulator for patients with androgen deficiency. In a 12-week study of 350 male subjects, it resulted in significantly decreased fat mass and increased lean body mass and muscle strength without significantly changing prostate specific antigen levels. The selective and antagonistic properties of TT701 appear to be well suited to provide anabolic therapeutic benefits to specific patient populations, while potentially avoiding, or even reducing, prostate hypertrophy. ELND005, a neuropsychiatric drug candidate. ELND005 is an orally administered small molecule that has completed phase 2 clinical studies in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome patients. ""This acquisition provides OPKO with two late stage drug candidates, each of which holds exceptional market potential,"" stated Phillip Frost, M.D., CEO and Chairman of OPKO. ""We believe TT401, a once-weekly dual GLP1/Glucagon agonist that recently showed success in a 420-patient phase 2 study, will complement OPKO's existing oxyntomodulin product candidate (MOD-6031), which may provide enhanced therapeutic benefit through targeted delivery.""","Published: July 1, 2016"

Published in Nature Methods, the new tool is an important step towards fully exploiting data produced in discovery proteomics experiments. On average, almost three quarters of spectra measured in discovery proteomics experiments remain unidentified, regardless of the quality of the experiment, as they cannot be interpreted by standard sequence-based search engines. Alternative approaches to improve the rate of identification exist, but are fraught with disadvantages including ambiguous results. In today s study, researchers working on the PRIDE Archive public repository of proteomics data present a large-scale  spectrum clustering  solution that takes advantage of the growing number of mass spectrometry (MS) datasets to systematically study millions of unidentified spectra.  MS experiments produce huge amounts of data, but identifying meaningful sequences that could be assigned to specific biological functions can be troublesome,  says Johannes Griss, formerly at EMBL-EBI in the UK and now at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria.  Discovery proteomics is a mature technology, and it s crucial that we are able to exploit the data efficiently."" One of the challenges with these technologies is that a large proportion of the data generated can t be interpreted, as they correspond to peptides that have not yet been observed and are not available in databases. Such spectra could correspond to peptide variants derived from individual generic variation, or to peptides containing post-translational modifications, which are essential for the biological functions of proteins.  What we have now is an algorithm that shows us patterns, or groups of spectra, that we ve consistently missed, and helps us figure out which ones are good enough to pursue,  adds Johannes.  It s a valuable tool that helps us unpick what s going on in proteomics, so we can better understand basic biological processes.  The team used the approach to recognise 9 million consistently unidentified spectra, which can make post-translational modifications and peptides containing sequence variants more discoverable. They identified three distinct sets of spectra: those that have been incorrectly identified, those that are not of high enough quality to identify properly, and those that are truly unidentified. They also combined their new approach with other methods to identify roughly 20% of the originally unidentified spectra in the public archive.  Discovery proteomics is a mature technology, and it s crucial that we are able to exploit the data efficiently   but creating a sensible subset of spectra to start an in-depth analysis of unidentified spectra has been very challenging,  says Juan Antonio Vizca no, who leads the Proteomics team at EMBL-EBI.  We developed a comparatively lightweight computational approach that makes it much easier to detect sequences that have been incorrectly identified, or consistently observed but not identified. These ready-to-use collections of commonly unidentified spectra are a resource for the community, so that we can all pool our efforts to find lasting solutions for proteomics research.  The new algorithm will be used to improve quality control in the PRIDE Archive. The complete spectrum clustering results are available through the PRIDE Cluster resource, which aims to simplify further investigation into unidentified spectra.","Published: July 1, 2016"

The collaboration will combine Merck s established leadership in immuno-oncology with Moderna s pioneering mRNA vaccine technology and GMP manufacturing capabilities to advance individually tailored cancer vaccines for patients across a spectrum of cancers. Moderna and Merck will develop personalized cancer vaccines that utilize Moderna s mRNA vaccine technology to encode a patient s specific neoantigens, unique mutations present in that specific patient s tumor. When injected into a patient, the vaccine will be designed to elicit a specific immune response that will recognize and destroy cancer cells. The companies believe that the mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccines  ability to specifically activate an individual patient s immune system has the potential to be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitor therapies, including Merck s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA  (pembrolizumab). In addition, Moderna has developed a rapid cycle time, small-batch manufacturing technique that will uniquely allow the company to supply vaccines tailored to individual patients within weeks. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck will make an upfront cash payment to Moderna of $200 million, which Moderna will use to lead all research and development efforts through proof of concept. The development program will entail multiple studies in several types of cancer and include the evaluation of mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccines in combination with Merck s KEYTRUDA. Moderna will also utilize the upfront payment to fund a portion of the build-out of a GMP manufacturing facility in suburban Boston for the purpose of personalized cancer vaccine manufacturing.  Following human proof of concept studies, Merck has the right to elect to make an additional undisclosed payment to Moderna. If exercised, the two companies will then equally share cost and profits under a worldwide collaboration for the development of personalized cancer vaccines. Moderna will have the right to elect to co-promote the personalized cancer vaccines in the U.S. The agreement entails exclusivity around combinations with KEYTRUDA. Moderna and Merck will each have the ability to combine mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccines with other (non-PD-1) agents.  Combining immunotherapy with vaccine technology may be a new path toward improving outcomes for patients,  said Dr. Roger Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories.  While the area of personalized cancer vaccine research has faced challenges in the past, there have been many recent advances, and we believe that working with Moderna to combine an immuno-oncology approach, using KEYTRUDA, with mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccines may have the potential to transform the treatment of cancer.   Our team has made significant progress since beginning our work in personalized cancer vaccines just last year. Through this collaboration with Merck, we are now well-positioned to accelerate research and development with a goal of entering the clinic in 2017, as well as to apply our unique GMP manufacturing capabilities to support the rapid production of these highly individualized vaccines,  said St phane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna.  We value our continued collaboration with Merck, and we look forward to working together to harness the potential of personalized cancer vaccines and immuno-oncology to bring a new treatment paradigm to patients.  Merck and Moderna have an existing collaboration and license agreement focused on the discovery and development of mRNA-based infectious disease vaccines and passive immunity treatments. Moderna is also advancing its own pipeline of infectious disease vaccine candidates and currently has two phase 1 studies underway in Europe and the U.S.","Published: July 1, 2016"

Researchers from KU Leuven and the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology have now shown that some memories can also be erased when one particular gene is switched off. The team trained mice that had been genetically modified in one single gene: neuroplastin. This gene, which is investigated by only a few groups in the world, is very important for brain plasticity. In humans, changes in the regulation of the neuroplastin gene have recently been linked to decreased intellectual abilities and schizophrenia. In the reported study, the mice were trained to move from one side of a box to the other as soon as a lamp lights up, thus avoiding a foot stimulus. This learning process is called associative learning. Its most famous example is Pavlov s dog: conditioned to associate the sound of a bell with getting food, the dog starts salivating whenever it hears a bell. When the scientists switched off the neuroplastin gene after conditioning, the mice were no longer able to perform the task properly. In other words, they showed learning and memory deficits that were specifically related to associative learning. The control mice with the neuroplastin gene switched on, by contrast, could still do the task perfectly. Professor Detlef Balschun from the KU Leuven Laboratory for Biological Psychology:  We were amazed to find that deactivating one single gene is enough to erase associative memories formed before or during the learning trials. Switching off the neuroplastin gene has an impact on the behaviour of the mice, because it interferes with the communication between their brain cells.  By measuring the electrical signals in the brain, the KU Leuven team discovered clear deficits in the cellular mechanism used to store memories. These changes are even visible at the level of individual brain cells, as postdoctoral researcher Victor Sabanov was able to show.  This is still basic research,  Balschun adds.  We still need further research to show whether neuroplastin also plays a role in other forms of learning. ","Published: July 1, 2016"

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced that there was no need to postpone or move the Olympics due to Zika s presence, but concern over the virus  spread and its link to serious birth defects is far from allayed. Public health experts debate whether WHO made the right call. But while the discussion continues, scientists are working on new tools to help manage the outbreak. Current gold-standard tests to detect the virus require expensive lab equipment and trained personnel. Low-cost diagnostic methods have been reported but can t detect low levels of the disease or don t distinguish between Zika and similar viruses such as dengue. Changchun Liu and colleagues wanted to design a rapid, low-cost, and more reliable point-of-care detection test. To ensure their system would be highly selective for Zika without confusing it with similar viruses, the researchers looked for and found a stretch of genetic code that is nearly identical for 19 different strains of the Zika virus infecting people in the Americas but not in other pathogens. Then, with materials costing $2 per test, they developed a diagnostic system, which only requires the addition of water to operate. If the Zika-specific genetic sequence is in a saliva sample, a dye within the system will turn blue within 40 minutes. The test even works if low levels of the sequence are present.","Published: July 1, 2016"

But all this is predicated on a simple yet challenging task: controlling cellular behavior in three dimensions. So far, most cell culture approaches are limited to two-dimensional environments (e.g. a Petri dish or a chip), but that neither matches real biology nor helps us sculpt tissues and organs. Two EPFL scientists have now developed a new method that uses lasers to carve out paths inside biocompatible gels to locally influence cell function and promote tissue formation.  In the body, cells grow in 3D microspaces that are specific to each type of tissue   liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain etc. These microenvironments are important because they control the behavior of the cells, e.g. how they interact with other parts of the tissue to help it develop, function, and repair. In addition, the microenvironments themselves are very dynamic and adaptable, sending the cells various biochemical signals to adapt their behavior to physiological changes. This means that any successful merging of biology and engineering must first be able to grow cells in custom-built yet biologically active 3D spaces. Working at EPFL s Institute of Bioengineering, Matthias L tolf and his PhD student Nathalie Brandenberg have developed a method that uses a laser to cut three-dimensional pathways and networks for cells inside a hydrogel scaffold that matches their natural environment. The method combines lasers with microfluidics   the science of controlling fluids in micrometer-sized spaces. Here, the scientists used focalized short-pulsed lasers, which can generate enough power to create tiny tunnels in different biocompatible gels already used in cell biology and tissue engineering. The laser can be applied before or even during 3D cell culture, meaning that the cells can be controlled in real time to match their natural growth. Meanwhile, microfluidics have become the key to tissue engineering. The technology offers unprecedented control over the cells  microenvironment, as it can emulate the complex adaptability of biological microenvironments, allowing behavior-adjusting signals to be delivered to the cells in the form of drugs or other compounds. As such, microfluidics are extensively used to build cell culture systems for growing cells. However, microfluidics have been largely limited to 2D cell-culture applications, and are not easy to apply for long-term cultures. Some efforts to use microfluidics in 3D cultures have proven successful, but they involve multiple labor-intensive steps that render them inefficient for standardized applications. But by combining microfluidics with the flexibility of laser carving (or  photoablation ), Brandenberg and L tolf have brought ease, robustness and versatility to the approach.  Our method addresses the limitations of previous approaches,  says L tolf.  It is fully compatible with 3D cell cultures, and can be applied with a wide range of materials, different geometries, and can introduce or change existing microfluidic networks during the course of an experiment to control cells in an unprecedented way.

Now, in this month s issue of Immunity, a research team from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania describes how an antibody that recognizes the combination of a known cancer-associated surface protein and a cancer-associated carbohydrate can be applied as a CAR-based therapy for a wide range of solid tumors. The team demonstrated the new CARs  effectiveness in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. We engineered T cells to target a cancer-associated surface protein with shortened carbohydrate molecules,  said first author Avery Posey, PhD, an instructor in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.  Future cancer immunotherapies combining the targeting of cancer-specific carbohydrates and cancer proteins may lead to the development of incredibly effective and safe new therapies for patients. These engineered cells will be able to increase cancer specificity of this immunotherapy and decrease the potential for toxicity in patients.  In general, CAR T cell therapy involves collecting T cells from a patient s blood through a process similar to dialysis and engineering them to express cell-surface proteins that recognize specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells. The modified T cells are then given back to the patient to target and kill those cancer cells. Posey, along with co-senior authors Laura Johnson, PhD, director of the Solid Tumor Immunotherapy Laboratory in the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, and Carl June, MD, the Richard W. Vague Professor in Immunotherapy and director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen and University of Chicago, developed CAR T cells that express an antibody that specifically recognizes truncated carbohydrate molecules on a mucin 1 (MUC1) protein, which is absent on normal cells but abundant on cancer cells of many types of solid tumors and leukemias. When these CAR T cells were injected into mice with leukemia or pancreatic cancer, the tumors shrank, and were even eliminated in most animals, resulting in increased survival. The mice with pancreatic cancer were still alive 113 days after treatment with the CAR T cells; however, only one-third of the animals treated with CAR T cells that did not target the MUCI proteins with the truncated carbohydrate survived until the end of the experiment. Importantly, the CAR T cells could not damage normal human cells or cells without the abnormal carbohydrate. In addition, demonstrating through high-powered microscopy that normal cells express the immature, cancer-related version of the MUC1 protein only inside the cell while cancer cells shuttle the abnormal protein to the cell surface, was helpful to show why these CAR T cells can only recognize the cancer specific protein on tumors. These findings suggest that targeting abnormal, cancer-specific carbohydrates on proteins found in normal tissues and solid tumors could become a new immunotherapy for solid cancers. This combined tumor targeting may lead to future development of safe and effective therapies for patients. Posey is currently collaborating with University of Copenhagen colleague and co-author Catharina Steentoft, PhD to develop new therapies of this class.  Our study demonstrated safety and efficacy of this novel approach of cancer targeting,  Johnson said.  We are continuing to evaluate the safety of this therapy in additional models. Once the new models are complete, we plan to move this therapy into a phase I clinical trial for patients with solid tumors.  This research was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (5R01CA120409, 5R01CA037156, DP2CA174502), the Danish Research Councils (DFF   4004-00397B), and the Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF107).

The same is true for hydrogels. Made mostly of water, these gelatin-like polymer materials are stretchy and absorbent until they inevitably dry out.  Now engineers at MIT have found a way to prevent hydrogels from dehydrating, with a technique that could lead to longer-lasting contact lenses, stretchy microfluidic devices, flexible bioelectronics, and even artificial skin. The engineers, led by Xuanhe Zhao, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor in MIT s Department of Mechanical Engineering, devised a method to robustly bind hydrogels to elastomers   elastic polymers such as rubber and silicone that are stretchy like hydrogels yet impervious to water. They found that coating hydrogels with a thin elastomer layer provided a water-trapping barrier that kept the hydrogel moist, flexible, and robust.  Zhao says the group took inspiration for its design from human skin, which is composed of an outer epidermis layer bonded to an underlying dermis layer. The epidermis acts as a shield, protecting the dermis and its network of nerves and capillaries, as well as the rest of the body s muscles and organs, from drying out. The team s hydrogel-elastomer hybrid is similar in design to, and in fact multiple times tougher than, the bond between the epidermis and dermis. The team developed a physical model to quantitatively guide the design of various hydrogel-elastomer bonds. In addition, the researchers are exploring various applications for the hybrid material, including artificial skin. In the same paper, they report inventing a technique to pattern tiny channels into the hybrid material, similar to blood vessels. They have also embedded complex ionic circuits in the material to mimic nerve networks.  We hope this work will pave the way to synthetic skin, or even robots with very soft, flexible skin with biological functions,  Zhao says. The paper s lead author is MIT graduate student Hyunwoo Yuk. Co-authors include MIT graduate students German Alberto Parada and Xinyue Liu and former Zhao group postdoc Teng Zhang, now an assistant professor at Syracuse University. Getting under the skin In December 2015, Zhao s team reported that they had developed a technique to achieve extremely robust bonding of hydrogels to solid surfaces such as metal, ceramic, and glass. The researchers used the technique to embed electronic sensors within hydrogels to create a  smart  bandage. They found, however, that the hydrogel would eventually dry out, losing its flexibility. Others have tried to treat hydrogels with salts to prevent dehydration, which Zhao says is effective, but this method can make a hydrogel incompatible with biological tissues. Instead, the researchers, inspired by skin, reasoned that coating hydrogels with a material that was similarly stretchy but also water-resistant would be a better strategy for preventing dehydration. They soon landed on elastomers as the ideal coating, though the rubbery material came with one major challenge: It was inherently resistant to bonding with hydrogels.  Most elastomers are hydrophobic, meaning they do not like water,  Yuk says.  But hydrogels are a modified version of water. So these materials don t like each other much and usually can t form good adhesion.  The team tried to bond the materials together using the technique they developed for solid surfaces, but with elastomers, Yuk says, the hydrogel bonding was  horribly weak.  After searching through the literature on chemical bonding agents, the researchers found a candidate compound that might bring hydrogels and elastomers together: benzophenone, which is activated via ultraviolet (UV) light. After dipping a thin sheet of elastomer into a solution of benzophenone, the researchers wrapped the treated elastomer around a sheet of hydrogel and exposed the hybrid to UV light. They found that after 48 hours in a dry laboratory environment, the weight of the hybrid material did not change, indicating that the hydrogel retained most of its moisture. They also measured the force required to peel the two materials apart, and found that to separate them required 1,000 joules per square meters   much higher than the force needed to peel the skin s epidermis from the dermis.   This is tougher even than skin,  Zhao says.  We can also stretch the material to seven times its original length, and the bond still holds.  Expanding the hydrogel toolset Taking the comparison with skin a step further, the team devised a method to etch tiny channels within the hydrogel-elastomer hybrid to simulate a simple network of blood vessels. They first cured a common elastomer onto a silicon wafer mold with a simple three-channel pattern, etching the pattern onto the elastomer using soft lithography. They then dipped the patterned elastomer in benzophenone, laid a sheet of hydrogel over the elastomer, and exposed both layers to ultraviolet light. In experiments, the researchers were able to flow red, blue, and green food coloring through each channel in the hybrid material.   Yuk says in the future, the hybrid-elastomer material may be used as a stretchy microfluidic bandage, to deliver drugs directly through the skin.  We showed that we can use this as a stretchable microfluidic circuit,  Yuk says.  In the human body, things are moving, bending, and deforming. Here, we can perhaps do microfluidics and see how [the device] behaves in a moving part of the body.  The researchers also explored the hybrid material s potential as a complex ionic circuit. A neural network is such a circuit; nerves in the skin send ions back and forth to signal sensations such as heat and pain. Zhao says hydrogels, being mostly composed of water, are natural conductors through which ions can flow. The addition of an elastomer layer, he says, acts as an insulator, preventing ions from escaping   an essential combination for any circuit. To make it conductive to ions, the researchers submerged the hybrid material in a concentrated solution of sodium chloride, then connected the material to an LED light. By placing electrodes at either end of the material, they were able to generate an ionic current that switched on the light.  We show very beautiful circuits not made of metal, but of hydrogels, simulating the function of neurons,  Yuk says.  We can stretch them, and they still maintain connectivity and function.  Syun-Hyun Yun, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, says that hydrogels and elastomers have distinct physical and chemical properties that, when combined, may lead to new applications.  It is a thought-provoking work,  says Yun, who was not involved in the research.  Among many [applications], I can imagine smart artificial skins that are implanted and provide a window to interact with the body for monitoring health, sensing pathogens, and delivering drugs.  Next, the group hopes to further test the hybrid material s potential in a number of applications, including wearable electronics and on-demand drug-delivering bandages, as well as nondrying, circuit-embedded contact lenses.  Ultimately, we re trying to expand the argument of using hydrogels as an advanced engineering toolset,  Zhao says.","Published: July 1, 2016"

A team of scientists and program managers, led by the National Institutes of Health, has been studying a variety of implementation science approaches to prevent mother-to-child transmission and has published the results in a 16-article open-access supplement to the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes. In implementation science, scientists study how to integrate research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine care and services.  We have the tools at this moment to further decrease incidence of new infections, but we need to apply these tools more effectively to reach the undiagnosed and untreated mothers,  Fogarty Director, Dr. Roger I. Glass, and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, wrote in a foreword to the supplement. Preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) involves a cascade of factors that is inherently complex, crossing multiple biological phases for women and their infants   during pregnancy and after delivery   and requires deployment of multiple health services. Some studies used systems engineering approaches to examine treatment workflow, identify bottlenecks and gaps, task shifting options and other issues. Facility-level problems were considered, including drug shortages, overburdened staff, lack of service integration, insufficient mentoring, and poor patient-provider interactions. The scientists also identified domestic violence, abandonment and stigma as key barriers. The authors reported on the effectiveness of a variety of interventions:  Collaborating with churches to invite pregnant women to  baby showers,  which included HIV testing and gifts, was nearly twice as effective for screening and recruiting for treatment those who tested positive for HIV, than were invitations to clinic visits providing the same benefits.  Offering HIV testing and counseling for breastfeeding, family planning and other issues in the homes of study participants made it twice as likely the male partners   who often report feeling uncomfortable making clinic visits but are key to reducing HIV transmission   would be tested.  Training lay volunteers or  feeding buddies,  to provide information about breastfeeding, infant health and HIV treatment protocols may diminish the damaging impact of stigma on an HIV positive mother s ability to safely feed her child and adhere to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommend exclusive breastfeeding, antiretroviral therapy and early infant testing.  Providing cash incentives for prenatal clinic visits appeared to help keep women in care, but did not boost adherence to antiretroviral therapy.  Initiating drug therapy during pregnancy caused rapid declines in viral load, but more than 95 percent of women studied reported at least one side effect before delivery, which may lower adherence.  Deploying a point-of-care test for infant diagnosis of HIV using a portable, battery-operated device may result in more timely initiation of drug therapy, decreasing the number of children who are diagnosed with HIV weeks or months after birth and never receive treatment.  Administering pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention among pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa is likely cost-effective, economic modeling indicates. Researchers and policymakers from the United States and Africa who contributed to the supplement articles were part of the PMTCT Implementation Science Alliance, created and supported by the NIH and the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to investigate the role implementation science can play in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of PMTCT efforts. Research projects described in the supplement were funded by NIH grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of Research on Women s Health. The alliance was led by the Fogarty s Center for Global Health Studies. In addition to the funders, other participants in the alliance include, the Office of AIDS Research at NIH, along with outside agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, South Africa s Anova Health Institute, the United States Agency for International Development and the WHO. Despite enormous successes in PMTCT, important challenges remain. The scientists have identified priority areas for future study, including how to optimize linkage of HIV-positive infants into early treatment, improve models for retention and adherence of children receiving antiretrovirals, and prioritize locally driven research questions and processes that engage end users throughout.  Continuing to find innovative ways to foster collaboration of implementation science researchers with decision makers and program implementers will be critical to speed the translation of effective PMTCT interventions in the local context and health system programs,  the authors concluded.","Published: July 1, 2016"

That's the question Drexel University researchers hope to answer with one of two new studies launching this month. They have developed a computer game and smartphone app to help people control unhealthy eating habits and ultimately lose weight. The game is designed to improve a person's ""inhibitory control,"" the part of the brain that stops you from giving into unhealthy cravings even when the smell of french fries is practically begging you to step inside a fast food restaurant. See Also: New study reveals Tetris can block cravingsFor the second study, the researchers have developed a mobile app that intelligently detects patterns in a person's eating habits. When users are likely to slip from their dietary plans, the app provides tailored strategies to put them back on track. Researchers in Drexel's Laboratory for Innovations in Health-Related Behavior Change are now seeking participants for both studies. Sixty-nine percent of adults living in Philadelphia are overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While a number of factors contribute to the city's obesity epidemic, often the mind is the biggest barrier when it comes to losing weight, said Evan Forman, PhD, professor of psychology in the College of Arts and Sciences. It's been shown, for example, that sweet foods trigger the same feel-good brain chemicals as addictive drugs. ""Millions of people are trying to lose weight, and they are going about it in a reasonable way by trying to reduce calories. But you're going to slip from your diet plan. That pretty much happens to everyone,"" Forman said. ""You could say the secret of helping people actually lose weight is preventing these lapses, so we concentrated on how to best do that."" All day long, you have to make choices about what foods you consume. And it's no secret that there is ""a powerful part of your mind that drives you toward things that taste good and feel good,"" Forman said. Learn More: Scientists unravel brain circuits involved in cravingsLet's say a colleague brings a box of doughnuts into the office. For a person who habitually consumes sweets, the first reaction is, ""I want one."" The secondary response tries to pump the brakes on that urge. But that reaction is typically slower and less strong than impulse, according to Forman. ""However, studies have shown that if you do certain tasks that involve this inhibitory control over and over again, it actually gets stronger,"" he said. Forman and a team of researchers tested this theory in their study, published in the journal Appetite. Habitual snack food eaters were assigned to one of four short, training exercises designed to increase their mindful decision-making and strengthen their inhibitory control. The study concluded that both types of training were successful in reducing snack food eating. The researchers are now looking to find out whether inhibitory control training can help participants reduce their consumption of sugary foods, and ultimately lose weight. Their new training game called DietDash first requires study participants to disclose the types of sugary foods they consume most frequently. They will then be assigned to one of four versions of a game that is customized to their diet. For example, if someone lists soda and chocolate chip cookies as their favorite treats, those items will appear in the game. Players are instructed to press certain keys to respond to different types of images, including pictures of tasty sugary foods and pictures of healthy foods. As the player's inhibitory control improves, the game speed increases for an extra challenge. Users are instructed to play this game for eight minutes per day, every day for six weeks. Don't Miss: This is your brain on snacks: Brain stimulation affects craving, consumption Though other studies have shown this type of training at least temporarily affects users' eating habits, the researchers want to know what will happen over a course of two months. The project is funded with a grant from the National Institutes of Health. ""The study is really the first to attempt to train people for weeks in a row,"" Forman said. ""We think this can translate to real-world behaviors, because just like any task, it improves with practice."" Once the study is complete, Forman said the computer game could also be developed into a mobile app. The researchers' second design is a weight loss app called DietAlert, developed with funding from Weight Watchers and the Obesity Society. Used in conjunction with the Weight Watchers app, the smartphone application collects information about users' eating habits and uses a mathematical algorithm to determine when they are most likely to lapse from their diet plans. For example, the app may conclude that a person is most likely to eat junk food after lunch when she has skipped breakfast. As the app learns about someone's patterns, it will send out a warning alert and offer a tip to help the user stick to his or her health plan. ""Part of the difficulty with a diet plan stems from an inability to determine and target factors that continue to cause lapses over and over again,"" Forman said. Related: Using the fly to understand how pregnancy drives food cravingsThe DietAlert app distinguishes itself from the hundreds of other diet applications available, because it not only tracks a person's eating habits, but it uses that information to give personalized advice.

See Also: Important role nucleocytoplasmic transport in ALS & frontotemporal dementiaThe pioneering study, conducted by researchers from the Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), found that the C9orf72 protein, which is encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, functions in the autophagy pathway, something which is defective in patients with the most common inherited form of ALS and FTD. Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene carry a well-established risk for ALS and FTD which is the second most common cause of dementia in people under 65. However, until now the basis for this link has been unclear. Scientists believe one of the ways the C9ORF72 mutation may cause ALS and FTD is by reducing the amount of C9orf72 protein present in the cells, something which is very hard to verify without a clear understanding of the function of the C9orf72 protein. The Sheffield team led by Dr. Kurt De Vos and Dr. Andy Grierson investigated the role of the C9orf72 protein in nerve cells and found it regulates the initiation of a vital process called 'autophagy', which helps the cell to dispose of damaged proteins and cell parts, and recycles cell nutrients. ""Our study provides compelling evidence that the C9orf72 protein is required for the initiation of autophagy, a pathway essential for the survival of nerve cells,"" said De Vos. ""We could also show that that loss of C9orf72 protein function mimics the specific pathology observed in our ALS and FTD patients."" Grierson, fellow lead investigator, added: ""Diseases such as ALS and FTD are commonly associated with large protein clumps that accumulate in affected nerve cells. Our data now shows that the C9orf72 protein is involved in the cellular pathway that should dispose of these clumps and that the autophagy process is defective in the cells of our ALS and FTD patients. ""Further studies are needed to confirm if defective autophagy contributes to the disease process, but if this bears out then autophagy drugs may be beneficial for patients."" Related: Researchers develop strategy to combat genetic ALS, FTD Dr. Valerie de Broglie, Director of the Thierry Latran Foundation, said: ""We are pleased to see the positive outcome of the research selected by our European Scientific Advisory Board. Better understandings of pathways involved in ALS are of upmost importance to move towards a therapy."" Dr Doug Brown, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Frontotemporal dementia is the second most common form of dementia in those under the age of 65, and can include some upsetting symptoms, yet we know relatively little about its underlying causes. ""This study reveals what happens in the brain cells of people with a gene mutation that is known to cause frontotemporal dementia. Identifying the effects of faulty genes is a vital first step to being able to design drugs that could best help people living with the condition. The gene, known as C9ORF72, was only linked to dementia in the last five years so it's encouraging that advances are being made to piece together the important role it plays in the brain."" Dr Sadie Vile, Research Grants Manager at the MND Association, added: ""Although only about 10 per cent of MND cases are inherited, study of the genetic causes helps to understand the non-inherited or sporadic forms. The C9ORF72 gene was identified in 2011 as the most common cause (about 40 per cent) of all inherited MND.

The secret might lie in the brain activity they generate while relaxing. New findings by scientists at the University of Washington demonstrate that a five-minute measurement of resting-state brain activity predicted how quickly adults picked up a second language. The study, sponsored by the American Office of Naval Research (ONR), is the first to use patterns of resting-state brain waves to determine subsequent language learning rate. See Also: The brain watched during language learning""This is vital brain function research that could enable the military to develop a more effective selection process of those who can learn languages quickly,"" said Dr. Ray Perez, a program officer in ONR's Warfighter Performance Department, who oversees the research.

Study author Dr. Chantel Prat an associate professor and faculty researcher at the University of Washington's Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences wrote that the way someone's brain functions while at rest predicts 60 percent of their capacity for learning a second language. For the experiments, 19 participants adults between the ages of 18 and 31, with no previous experience learning French visited Prat's lab twice weekly over eight weeks for 30-minute French lessons delivered through an immersive, virtual-reality computer program called Operational Language and Cultural Training System (OLCTS). The ONR-funded OLCTS is designed to make military personnel proficient in a foreign language after 20 hours of training. The self-paced program guides users through a series of scenes and stories. A voice-recognition component enables users to check their pronunciation. Don't Miss: Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism To ensure experiment participants were progressing well, the researchers used periodic quizzes that required a minimum score before proceeding to the next lesson. The quizzes also served as measures for how quickly participants moved through the curriculum. For five minutes before and after the eight-week curriculum, Prat had participants sit still, close their eyes, breathe deeply and wear an EEG (electroencephalogram) headset measuring resting-state brain activity from the cerebral cortex an area of the brain crucial to memory, attention and perception. ""The brain waves we recorded reflect synchronized firing of large networks of neurons,"" said Prat. ""We found that the larger the networks were in 'beta' frequencies [brain frequencies associated with language and memory], the faster our participants learned French."" To confirm this, at the end of the eight-week language program, participants also completed a proficiency test covering the lessons they had finished. Those with the larger ""beta"" networks learned French twice as quickly. However, Prat is quick to point out that language learning rates were the only things predicted by the recorded brain activity. Participants with smaller ""beta"" networks still learned the material to which they were exposed equally well. ""There's more that goes into learning a new language than speed,"" said Prat. ""You also have to factor in motivation, study habits and practice methods.""

""By studying individual differences in the brain, we're figuring out key constraints on learning and information processing, to develop ways to improve language mastery,"" said Prat.

""I think of the entorhinal area as a funnel. It takes information from other sensory cortices the parts of the brain responsible for vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste and funnels it into the hippocampus. The hippocampus then binds this disparate information into a cohesive memory that can be reactivated in full by recalling only one part. But the hippocampus also plays a role in spatial navigation by telling us where we are in the world. These two functions converge in the same cells, and our study set out to examine this duality."" The new mouse model was genetically engineered to carry a particular surface receptor on the cells of the entorhinal cortex. When this receptor was activated by administering the drug ivermectin to the mice, the cells of the entorhinal cortex silenced their activity. They stopped funnelling information to the hippocampus. This system allowed the scientists to turn off the entorhinal cortex, and to determine how this affected hippocampal function. ""We know that the hippocampal neurons generate pulses of activity when the animal is in a particular space,"" said co-corresponding author Dr. Daoyun Ji, assistant professor of molecular & cell biology at Baylor.

As the mouse learned its environment, we picked up the electrical pulses produced by the neurons up to 50 neurons simultaneously so that we could examine the pattern that emerged. When the animal was in one area of the room, a particular brain pattern emerged. The pattern changed as the animal moved to another area. We could predict where the animal was by looking at its pattern of brain activity,"" said Ji. When the researchers turned off the entorhinal cortex with ivermectin, they saw the pattern of electrical signals in the hippocampus changed. Signals that had previously been associated with a particular location now became active in a different part of the room. ""We found that the hippocampus had remapped, the memory code was scrambled,"" said Ji. But would mice whose mental map had rearranged itself also lose their memory for the location they learned before re-mapping? To answer this question, the researchers trained mice to find a hidden escape platform submerged in a water maze using visual clues. Then some of the mice received ivermectin to inactivate the entorhinal cortex, while others did not. ""The mice had been trained for 7 to 10 days, so they knew where to go to escape the pool. But when we turned off the entorhinal cortex, their hippocampal map got scrambled and the animals couldn't remember how to exit the pool,"" said Ji.

Because ivermectin is both safe and inexpensive, this particular system can be used for longer periods of inactivation appropriate for studying chronic conditions like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.

The Mount Sinai study focuses on identifying the mechanisms by which specific brain reward regions interact to modulate the motivational or rewarding component of aggressive behavior using a mouse model. See Also: Aggression causes new nerve cells to be generated in the brainMaladaptive aggressive behavior is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders and is thought to partly result from inappropriate activation of brain reward systems in response to aggressive or violent social stimuli. While previous research has implicated the basal forebrain as a potentially important brain reward region for aggression-related behaviors, there had been limited functional evidence that the basal forebrain, or its projections to other brain regions, directly controls the rewarding aspects of aggression. ""Our study is the first to demonstrate that bullying behavior activates a primary brain reward circuit that makes it pleasurable to a subset of individuals,"" says Scott Russo, PhD, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Furthermore, we show that manipulating activity in this circuit alters the activity of brain cells and ultimately, aggression behavior."" To study individual differences in aggressive behavior, the current team established a mouse behavioral model that exposed adult males to a younger subordinate mouse for three minutes each day for three consecutive days, and found that 70 percent of mice exhibited aggressive behavior (AGGs) while 30 percent of mice show no aggression at all (NONs). Using conditioned place preference, a technique commonly used in animal studies to evaluate preferences for environmental stimuli that have been associated with a positive or negative reward, study investigators research found that AGGs mice bullied/attacked the subordinate mouse and subsequently developed a conditioned place preference for the intruder-paired context, suggesting that the aggressive mice found the ability to subordinate another mouse rewarding. Conversely, NONs mice did not bully/attack the intruder mouse and subsequently developed a conditioned place aversion. Related: Does sexual aggression alter the female brain?Neurotransmitters that cross the synapse and attach to receptors on a neighboring cell can change the properties of the receiving cell. Found throughout the brain and produced by neurons, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that binds to GABA receptors, making the neighboring neuron less excitable. The current study team investigated GABA projection neurons that can send long-range connections to inhibit neurons in other brain regions. Specifically, using electrophysiological and histological techniques, the research team found that when exposed to the opportunity to bully another individual, AGGs mice exhibit increased activity of the basal forebrain GABA projection neurons that reduce activity in the lateral habenula, an area of the brain that would normally encode an aversion to aggressive stimuli. Conversely, they found NONs exhibit reduced basal forebrain activation and a subsequent increase in lateral habenula neuronal firing, which makes the aggression stimuli aversive. While previous research has found the lateral habenula to play a role in negative moods states and aversion across a broad range of species, including mice and humans, little was previously known about the neural mechanisms that directly regulate the motivational component of aggressive behavior. Researchers then used optogenetic tools to directly manipulate the activity of GABA between the basal forebrain and the lateral habenula, demonstrating that stimulation or inhibition of BF-lHb projections is both sufficient and necessary to alter the inclination to engage in or avoid the opportunity to bully. Learn More: Omega-3 lowers childhood aggression in short term, research shows""When we artificially induced the rapid GABA neuron activation between the basal forebrain and lateral habenula, we watched in real time as the aggressive mice became docile and no longer showed bullying behavior,"" says Dr. Russo. ""Our study is unique in that we took information about the basal forebrain, lateral habenula projections and then actually went back and manipulated these connections within animals to conclusively show that the circuits bi-directionally control aggression behavior."" The study findings demonstrate a previously unidentified functional role for the lateral habenula and its inputs from the basal forebrain in mediating the rewarding component of aggression and suggest that targeting shared underlying deficits in motivational circuitry may provide useful information for the development of novel therapeutic drugs for treating aggression-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

They use an artificial language with real structures to show how new linguistic information is integrated into the same brain areas used for your native language. See Also: A dominant hemisphere for handedness and language? Learning a new language is a difficult task. It requires skills for memorizing new words, learning how to put those words together in a grammatical way, and integrating them with existing linguistic knowledge. Rresearchers at the Donders Institute and Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics observed these skills through brain imaging as native speakers of Dutch learned an artificial miniature language 'Alienese'. The major discovery was that the brain cares whether or not the grammatical properties of the new language (in this case, word order) resemble the grammatical properties of your native language. If they are similar, your brain uses its own grammar in learning the new language. And if the word order of the new language differs from your mother tongue, your brain needs to build a new grammatical repertoire. For the first time, researchers have shown that it helps the brain if it can reuse characteristics of our mother tongue when learning a new language. Alienese consisted of a set of words like josa 'woman', komi 'man', and oku 'to photograph'. These words could be combined in a particular order, which either did or did not conform for Dutch word order. For instance, both sentences Komi oku josa (man photograph woman) and Josa komi oku (woman man photograph) have the meaning ""The man photographs the woman"". The former sentence conforms to Dutch word order (and English), but the latter does not. Participants read sentences with familiar and unfamiliar word orders accompanied by pictures depicting the meaning (see image above). When the unfamiliar word orders (josa komi oku) were repeated, brain activation increased within regions of the brain network known to be involved for your native language. Lead author of the study Kirsten Weber proposes, ""The enhanced activity might reflect a brain mechanism to build and strengthen a neural network to process novel word order regularities."" When the familiar word order (komi oku josa) was repeated, brain activation decreased in language-related regions. ""That we found suppressed activation on the other hand, supports our ideas Learn More: First language wires brain for later language-learningthat a known structure in a novel language quickly behaves like a structure in your native language. Processing a known structure is easier for the brain second time round. As a whole, our study shows that we seem to use the same brain areas for native and new language structures and that Alienese was in the process of being integrated into the participants existing language brain networks.""

The assay strategy, which was recently published in Scientific Reports, can be used to better understand and improve the function of gene-editing technologies. Using Bio-Rad s Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR ) technology, researchers at the Gladstone Institutes and the Digital Biology Group at Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. were able to detect editing events at frequencies as low as one in 1,000 copies of the genome. Achieving this level of sensitivity allowed the researchers to examine how experimental conditions impact genome-editing outcomes. Scientists can use this assay strategy to optimize their experiments for increased effectiveness in their genome-editing protocols. Current Challenges in Measuring Genome-Editing Outcomes A number of methods exist for detecting genome-editing events, although each has drawbacks. High resolution melt analysis has limited sensitivity and quantitative ability, while next-generation sequencing is laborious and often cost-prohibitive. In addition, many methods for measuring genome-editing outcomes monitor only the random non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) edits and neglect to monitor the precise homology-directed repair (HDR) edits. What s needed is a method that can measure both types of repairs effectively and simultaneously.  There had been no quick and easy method to monitor HDR and NHEJ at the same time,  said Dr. Yuichiro Miyaoka, the study s lead author. Dr. Miyaoka conducted the research while he was at Gladstone. He is now a project leader for the Regenerative Medicine Project at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. Ultrasensitive Quantification of Genome Editing Events Using ddPCR Bio-Rad s ddPCR technology is well suited for the challenge of detecting rare events such as NHEJ and HDR edits by massively partitioning samples into thousands of droplets, effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of a rare target DNA in the reaction. For this study, the researchers used fluorescently labeled probes that bound the target DNA to create unique fluorescence signatures indicating if HDR, NHEJ, or no editing occurred at the chosen DNA site. The assay has a detection limit of <0.05% for HDR edits, and as low as 0.1% for NHEJ. The method also provides quicker results than next-gen sequencing.  Once you have a validated assay, you can go from sample to answer for dozens of experiments in a day,  said Dr. Jennifer Berman, co-first author on the study and a Digital Biology Group staff scientist. Gene-Editing Outcomes Depend Greatly on Experimental Conditions Most genome-editing conditions induce more NHEJ than HDR, but this study found some conditions that induce more HDR than NHEJ. The findings demonstrate that the HDR- and NHEJ-inducing activities are context dependent, and the ddPCR assay strategy is very powerful for monitoring genome-editing outcomes.  We are interested in exploring the therapeutic potential of genome editing but needed to better understand the factors that impact its effectiveness,  said senior author Dr. Bruce R. Conklin, a senior investigator at Gladstone and a Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that genome-editing outcomes depended greatly on experimental conditions, including the nuclease, cell type, and gene target.  Our results indicate that researchers have to carefully screen for the best conditions to achieve the desired outcomes for their application,  said Dr. Miyaoka. A Growing Application for ddPCR In addition to the Conklin laboratory, many other researchers have begun to use ddPCR for gene-edit detection, as well as for evaluating the molecular consequences of editing cells in living organisms. Recent research from Duke University and collaborators established genome editing as a potential therapy to treat Duchenne s muscular dystrophy (DMD). The researchers used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to remove a mutation in the dystrophin gene from a mouse model of DMD. Using ddPCR, they were able to detect precise edits from muscle lysate and quantify messenger RNA of the in vivo edited dystrophin gene. The result was an improvement of muscle function in mice containing the desired gene edit. Other research published in Nature Protocols from the laboratory of Dr. Boris Fehse addresses a current bottleneck for researchers using gene-editing tools in quantifying gene knockout rates. This work describes a ddPCR method for simultaneously detecting wild-type and NHEJ event frequencies with a new technique they termed gene-editing frequency digital PCR (GEF-dPCR).  Exact quantification of gene-editing frequencies is particularly important in translational medicine, but has so far been limited by the lack of suitable, straightforward methods,  said Dr. Fehse, Professor for Cell and Gene Therapy in Hamburg (Germany).  The new dPCR-based techniques now facilitate precise and sensitive assessment of gene editing even on precious in-vivo samples from preclinical and clinical studies. ","Published: June 30, 2016"

Ebola virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness in humans and Ebola viruses (EBOVs) are responsible for repeated outbreaks of fatal infections, including the recent epidemic in West Africa, which resulted in more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.  Currently, there are no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines for the disease, however, there is clearly an urgent need to find lead compounds for drug development or repurpose drugs for the treatment of EBOV disease. EBOV is an enveloped virus where the membrane envelope contains glycoprotein (GP), a molecule that is solely responsible for the three key stages of the viral attack. GP is therefore a primary target for the development of antiviral drugs.  Prof Dave Stuart, MRC Research Professor at the Division of Structural Biology at the University of Oxford and Diamond Light Source, explains,  Exploring the potential of drugs that are already licensed makes sense because they have already been through clinical trials so the timeframe for bringing them to market is usually much quicker. A set of potential inhibitors for EBOV had been identified, including an anticancer drug toremifene and the painkiller ibuprofen, however, their mechanism of action was largely unknown.   Using the crystallography beamlines at Diamond, we solved the structure of EBOV GP in its native state and also bound with toremifene and ibuprofen. The native structure gives a more complete and accurate picture of the molecule itself and the conformational changes that take place when an antibody is introduced and receptor binding takes place.   Our results, which we have published today in Nature, were unexpected.  The binding site is different to that predicted for ibuprofen. We were able to pinpoint the binding site of toremifene and ibuprofen on the surface of the molecule and reveal that the drugs decrease the stability of the viral GP, triggering premature release of one of its subunits and, crucially, preventing viral fusion. Toremifene was shown to lock in more tightly than ibuprofen.  This information can guide the design of more powerful anti-EBOV drugs.  My group will be continuing this project at Diamond on the new XChem fragment screening facility, which should help us to further accelerate the rational drug design process. We hope this research will lead to new drugs that can help to save lives if we are faced with further outbreaks of the disease in the future. ","Published: June 30, 2016"

This means that these devices have the potential to be used in the human body in the future in applications such as drug delivery and locating cancer cells. This new technique allows the researchers to use safer, non-toxic materials, meaning the micro-rockets will not cause harm or injure any living tissue or biological environment. This is a significant development as previous devices have been expensive to produce, complicated to manufacture and made from polystyrene beads, carbon nanotubes or metals which have to be covered in a catalyst layer (such as platinum) to be able to swim successfully, these devices are usually less friendly to the biological environment they are placed in. The rockets are just 300 microns in length and 100 microns in diameter, the thickness of a single human hair, and create their own thrust, allowing them to  swim  through any bio fluid containing the fuel. This is the first time these micro-rockets have been produced using a new reactive inkjet printing method, using a solution of dissolved silk mixed with an enzyme. This solution is then placed into a 3D inkjet printer, which, similar to normal inkjet printing, builds up layers of ink to create a column of the rocket. By printing methanol on top of the printed solution it triggers a reaction which forms rigid rocket shape which traps the enzyme within a silk lattice structure. This enzyme acts as a catalyst, reacting with fuel molecules to produce bubbles that propel the rocket forward. Using an enzyme as a catalyst and silk to form the rocket, produces a much safer device that is biodegradable, cheaper and simpler to makeway, removing a major barrier to micro-rockets becoming a reality outside of the lab. Dr Xiubo Zhao, from The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Sheffield states:  By using a natural enzyme like catalase and silk which are fully biodegradable, our devices are far more biocompatible than earlier swimming devices.   The inkjet printing technique also allows us to digitally define the shape of a rocket before it s produced. This makes it a lot easier to optimise the shape in order to control the way the device swims. ","Published: June 30, 2016"

When white blood cells need to get to the site of an infection, they can exit the bloodstream via a process called diapedesis. In diapedesis, the white blood cell changes its shape in order to squeeze between or through the epithelial cells that form the walls of the blood vessel. Diapedesis is a well-understood process, and researchers believed that other types of cells, like therapeutic stem cells or even metastatic cancer cells, exited blood vessels in a similar way   with the cells pushing or squeezing themselves out. But a group of researchers led by Ke Cheng, associate professor of molecular biomedical sciences at NC State with a joint appointment in the NC State/UNC-Chapel Hill Department of Biomedical Engineering, found that these stem cells behaved differently. Therapeutic stem cells share the same ability to exit the bloodstream and target particular tissues that white blood cells do. But the precise way that they did so was not well understood, so Cheng and his team utilized a zebrafish model to study the process. The genetically modified zebrafish embryos were transparent and had fluorescently marked green blood vessels. Researchers injected the embryos with white blood cells and cardiac stem cells from humans, rats and dogs. These cells had all been marked with a red fluorescent protein. Through time-lapse three-dimensional light sheet microscopic imaging, Cheng and his team could trace the progress of these cells as they left the blood vessel. The white blood cells exited via diapedesis, as expected. When stem cells exited the blood vessel, however, the endothelial cells lining the vessel actively expelled them. Membranes surrounding the endothelial cells on either side of the stem cell stretched themselves around the stem cell, then met in the middle to push the stem cell out of the vessel.  When you re talking about diapedesis, the white blood cell is active because it changes its shape in order to exit. The endothelial cells in the blood vessel are passive,  Cheng says.  But when we looked at therapeutic stem cells, we found the opposite was true   the stem cells were passive, and the endothelial cells not only changed their shape in order to surround the stem cell, they actually pushed the stem cells out of the blood vessel. We ve named this process angiopellosis, and it represents an alternative way for cells to leave blood vessels.  The researchers found two other key differences between angiopellosis and diapedesis: one, that angiopellosis takes hours, rather than minutes, to occur; and two, that angiopellosis allows more than one cell to exit at a time.  Angiopellosis is really a group ticket for cells to get out of blood vessels,  Cheng says.  We observed clusters of cells passing through in this way. Obviously, this leads us to questions about whether other types of cells, like metastatic cancer cells, may be using this more effective way to exit the bloodstream, and what we may need to do to stop them.

In this way we can unlock those membrane proteins that are currently intractable for structure-based drug discovery.  Fiona Marshall, Heptares  Chief Scientific Officer, said:  We are delighted to enter this new collaboration with leadXpro and excited to see if these cutting-edge technologies can generate new insights for structure-based drug discovery with GPCR crystals that prove challenging to standard X-ray crystallography. Serial crystallography and free electron laser technology are powerful new techniques that could open many new opportunities for drug discovery when applied to StaR  proteins. This collaboration is a further demonstration of our commitment to remain at the forefront of GPCR structure based drug discovery. ","Published: June 30, 2016"

This new insight can contribute to the understanding of why some but not others are affected by memory impairment. The results have been published in the journal PNAS. See Also: Is there a connection between heavy metals and aging? Using brain-imaging technologies (PET and MRI), memory tests and statistical analyses, Professor Lars Nyberg and his colleagues are trying to capture what happens to our memory and our brain as we grow old. The neurotransmitter dopamine is of significance to our motor functions but also to memory and other cognitive functions. The D1 receptor system has been linked to functions mediated by the frontal lobe, but it has been unknown what specific role the D2 receptor system has. In this study, a PET camera was used to examine individual differences in the D2 system in a vast group consisting of 181 healthy individuals between the age of 64 and 68. All participants also had to take part in an all-inclusive performance test of the long-term episodic memory, working memory and processing speed along with an MRI assessment (which was used to measure the size of various parts of the brain). Researchers could see that the D2 system was positively linked to episodic memory, but not to working memory or to processing speed by relating PET registrations to the cognitive data. Researchers could also see that the D2 system affects the functioning of the hippocampus in the brain. The hippocampus is since long linked to long-term episodic memory.

(FMI), a molecular information company that has generated genomic profiles of people with cancer. NCI s GDC is a unified data system that promotes the sharing of genomic and clinical data among researchers and is a core component of the Cancer Moonshot and the President s Precision Medicine Initiative. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. The expanded number of cancer cases in the GDC will allow researchers to identify genomic changes that are responsible for the cancerous growth of tumors in individual patients, and identify which drugs may block the effects of these mutations.  Such targeted drugs can produce remissions in certain patients. When the GDC was launched earlier this month, it was able to immediately capitalize on the genomic data that existed in several large-scale NCI programs, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and its pediatric equivalent, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). Together, TCGA and TARGET represent some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomic datasets in the world, with information generated from about 14,500 patients.  The addition of data from 18,000 adult patients with a diverse array of cancers that underwent genomic profiling using FMI s proprietary comprehensive genomic profiling assay, called FoundationOne, will provide a major boost to the GDC. FMI developed FoundationOne as a commercially available test that uses advanced sequencing technology to routinely analyze cancer specimens.  This major infusion of data in the GDC will greatly enhance our ability to use this tool to explore genetic abnormalities in cancer,  said Douglas Lowy, M.D., NCI Acting Director.  Through TCGA and TARGET, we had already established a strong cancer genomic foundation for the GDC at its launch, but with the addition of the genomic data from FMI, we believe that the GDC will be an even more useful resource for researchers worldwide to help us unravel the complexities of many forms of cancer.  Importantly, in both the NCI and the Foundation Medicine databases, all patient information has been de-identified, meaning that personal information, such as addresses, Social Security numbers, and other possible identifiers, are not present   only crucial genetic data and key demographic information are available.  We re honored to participate in this important global effort to transform patient care and to be the first commercial entity to contribute data to the NCI s GDC, which we believe underscores the quality, integrity and richness of the genomics information contained in the Foundation Medicine database,  said Vincent Miller, M.D., chief medical officer, Foundation Medicine.  The amount of genomics information within Foundation Medicine database has reached unparalleled scale. The insights gleaned from this data release will be instrumental in accelerating research and development efforts for targeted agents and immunotherapies.  The genomics information contributed by Foundation Medicine can be used by authorized researchers following approval by an NIH Data Access Committee. Requesters must affirm that their use of the data is solely for biomedical research purposes and for publication or presentation in scientific journals or at research meetings.","Published: June 29, 2016"

This comprehensive map will focus on enzymes involved in the control of metabolism and will be developed through the use of a fast and highly accurate, high content proteomics platform using SCIEX micro-flow chromatography and data-independent SWATH  acquisition.  There is a growing demand for dramatic improvements in the speed and the robustness of large-scale proteome analysis. The SWATH platform that will be utilized for this study allows systematic recording of semi-targeted proteomic profiles at a significantly higher throughput than with previous methods, and will be fundamental to the success of the research.  The project is supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) UK and will yield a unique resource for the scientific community and industry as it explores metabolic regulation and its effect on aging and age-associated diseases. Understanding the function and activity of the metabolic network is of paramount importance for the biotechnology industry. New insights into these processes will allow scientists to modify and exploit the metabolic network to alter the yield and nature of metabolites. It has particular application for medical research into the aging process, where increased understanding of enzymatic controls could provide new potential targets or candidate therapies in precision medicine and age-associated diseases. The study will be led by internationally recognized researchers within the field of metabolic regulation and proteomics: the Francis Crick s Dr. Markus Ralser and Professor Kathryn Lilley from the University of Cambridge. Dr. Ralser s lab focuses on the dynamics of metabolic networks during stress situations, aging, the role of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway in cancer, and the early evolution of metabolic pathways. Professor Lilley leads a research group that is interested in what determines the spatial arrangement of the proteome and has developed a suite of protocols and software for organelle proteomics data. Dr. David Roblin, Chief Operating Officer and Director of Scientific Translation at the Francis Crick Institute, said,  We are delighted that this collaboration with SCIEX, the University of Cambridge and the Crick will go forward.  The grant from the BBSRC demonstrates that the multidisciplinary nature of the Crick is creating new scientific ideas that are leading to translation and commercial opportunities. This accelerated translation of our science for health and wealth benefits is a key feature of our strategy.  The success of precision medicine will depend on so-called industrialized proteomics, allowing faster analysis of larger sample sets than the current, widely-used omics methods. SCIEX is leading the development of industrialized proteomics workflows, including Microflow SWATH, which delivers significantly faster proteome analysis than traditional nanoflow-based SWATH Acquisition, while retaining comprehensive proteome coverage.  The body of work that will result from this collaboration is highly sought after in life science research today. Gaining and sharing knowledge around the aging process has great potential for unlocking answers to the questions of precision medicine and SCIEX is proud to be part of this effort,  states Chris Radloff, Global Vice President & General Manager of the LC-MS Business at SCIEX.  This work is an excellent example of how SCIEX solutions enable the scientific community to face the most pressing analytical challenges of today. ","Published: June 29, 2016"

At the same time, in laboratory experiments, antibodies against dengue could enhance Zika virus infection of human cells. Zika virus is similar genetically to dengue virus and part of the same flavivirus family. They are both transmitted by Aedes mosquitos. Dengue is endemic in several countries currently experiencing Zika outbreak, leading to proposals that pre-existing dengue immunity is influencing the severity of the Zika epidemic.  There are really two sides of the coin here: both cross-neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement,  says Jens Wrammert, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics (infectious diseases) at Emory University School of Medicine and Emory Vaccine Center.  We find antibody-mediated enhancement of infection with cells in the laboratory, but we have yet to clarify what effects these antibodies have on the outcome of infection in humans.   Zika immune responses and disease severity may be different in dengue-endemic areas, or among dengue-experienced vs dengue-na ve groups. These factors must be taken into account when doing Zika vaccine or other clinical studies.  There are four strains of dengue virus, and infection with one strain does not lead to long-lasting immunity against the other three. In fact, secondary infection with a different strain can increase the risk of developing a more severe illness, called dengue hemorrhagic fever. This is thought to happen through  antibody-dependent enhancement : pre-existing antibodies to the first strain, unable to stop the secondary infection, instead bind to immune cells and help the new strain infect them. Emory scientists found that a similar phenomenon occurs with Zika. Antibodies obtained from nine dengue-infected patients at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok   both during acute infection and after recovery   could help Zika virus (a strain isolated in 2015 from Puerto Rico) infect immune cells in cell culture.  It will be important to know whether anti-dengue antibodies facilitate Zika virus penetrating the placental barrier and allowing access to the developing fetus,  says co-author Mehul Suthar, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics (infectious disease) at Emory University School of Medicine and Emory Vaccine Center. Since 2012, a handful of cases of Zika have been reported in Thailand, ( sporadic transmission  according to the World Health Organization), but not at the numbers seen in South America or the Caribbean. The co-first authors of the paper are Emory graduate students Lalita Priyamvada and Kendra Quicke. They tested serum samples from the Thai patients and also isolated antibody genes from plasmablasts, the immune cells responsible for pumping out antibodies. All the serum samples tested were able to cross-react with Zika, both by binding and by neutralization. Nearly half the dengue-reactive monoclonal antibodies isolated bound to samples of Zika proteins. A bright spot for the future is that the team has identified potent Zika neutralizing antibodies.  Determining what part of the virus the various neutralizing antibodies target could help with design of vaccines or antibody-based therapies,  Wrammert says. Wrammert and Suthar are planning to examine immune responses in returning travelers who experienced Zika infection in collaboration with co-author Mark Mulligan, MD, director of the Hope Clinic of Emory Vaccine Center.

We have potentially found an important target for anti-cancer treatment,  said TSRI Professor Xiang-Lei Yang, who led the study. Catching a Double Agent Since the early days of life on Earth, GlyRS has played a role in protein synthesis, helping cells function and grow. The new study, a collaboration with Professor Patrick Griffin s lab on the Florida campus of TSRI, reveals that GlyRS is actually a double agent in addition to its biologically essential role in making proteins, it can help to further modify proteins in a way that launches cancer growth. The researchers found that overexpression of GlyRS may lead to too little p27 a protein than Yang compared to a stop sign for cell growth. Specifically, the team found that GlyRS creates a protective shield around a modifier protein, called NEDD8, and safely  chaperones  it to meet its target protein, called cullin. With NEDD8 in place, cullin is activated to degrade p27. Kept at the right levels, p27 regulates the cell cycle, stopping potential cancer growth. But when GlyRS levels increase, too much p27 gets degraded and cells multiply unchecked.   Cancer cells hijack and over-exaggerate the system,  said TSRI Research Associate Zhongying Mo, first author of the study.  This can lead to tumorigenesis.  This process is especially dangerous given GlyRS s additional function in protein synthesis, which supplies cancers with the proteins they need to keep growing.  Ultimately, both functions are linked to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis,  Yang said. Indeed, when Mo analyzed data from a breast cancer tissue database, she found that patients with increased GlyRS had higher mortality. Although this research is at the basic stage, the team believes it could guide future cancer diagnostics and therapies. For example, measuring GlyRS may provide a marker to help doctors predict how quickly a patient s cancer might progress. The team now plans to study the effects of GlyRS in different types of cancer and the possibility of developing a drug to inhibit GlyRS.","Published: June 29, 2016"

Pilot Growth Equity, a technology growth equity firm with offices in San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC, led the round and is the sole institutional investor. Perthera is the market and technology leader in Precision Cancer Analysis ( PCA ), which provides physicians a more accurate understanding of a patient s cancer and thereby the ability to identify prospective treatment options personalized to the individual patient. At the same time, a PCA provides individuals access to a world-class actionable therapy plan wherever in the world they may be.  With Operation Moonshot and other initiatives worldwide exploring how new medical technologies can finally put an end to cancer, we think current practices are going to evolve and change dramatically,  said Perthera CEO Andrew Mignatti.  One major change in the foreseeable future will be that a PCA will be the first step undertaken by people diagnosed with cancer just as today an MRI is the first step of those who need detailed pictures of a body s structural and organic systems. That detailed level of analysis will, in turn, lead to the identification of specific therapies, including those in clinical trials, appropriate for individual patients. One major result will be that oncologists, families and patients can make more informed decisions about their care,  he said. Emmanuel  Chip  Petricoin, PhD, who co-founded the company with well-known investor and tech executive Dendy Young, explained,  The rapid progress being achieved in the field of precision medicine offers the very real promise of more successful new treatments for cancer. But a precise understanding of an individual s particular cancer tumor is a prerequisite to the use of precision medicines, and that s what a PCA can provide,  he said.  We do that by using the most sophisticated and comprehensive molecular analysis available. Although genomic testing has proven to be a breakthrough technology, an even more comprehensive portrait of a patient s cancer can be obtained through our multi-omic analysis. Our unique workflow protects tissue, utilizes best-in-class molecular testing, and leverages our unique and growing databank of previous treatment histories and patient outcomes. The PCA is becoming a critical part of the future of cancer treatment,  Petricoin added. Neil Callahan, a co-founder and managing director of Pilot Growth Equity, who has joined Perthera s board, said,  Perthera s growth over the last four years has been compelling. Hundreds of oncology practices, including many of the most respected cancer treatment centers and hospitals across the United States, have ordered the PCA. Adoption of the PCA as the oncologist s and patient s first step in developing a cancer treatment strategy is accelerating at a rapid pace. Perthera s proprietary software platform automates the creation of the PCA, integrates the data from all previous analyses and patient history, produces a detailed personalized analysis of the patient s unique cancer, and delivers an improved patient experience plus an increasingly higher probability of medical success. In addition to its technology innovations, Perthera has formed a world class Virtual Tumor Board made up of leading oncologists who provide the treating physicians and patients with a  virtual second opinion  based on their expertise in concert with the Perthera PCA,  he said.

In order to efficiently breed new crop varieties it is necessary to rapidly identify the genes related to high crop yields and analyze what makes them special. Until now the genetic analysis of crops has mainly been based on quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, but this method requires time to develop experimental populations. Another method known as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), frequently used to analyze human genes, uses data from many extant individuals to analyze genes in a short time span. Various plant species have also been analyzed using this method, but there have been very few cases of successful analysis. In order to produce results using GWAS analysis, the research team limited their targets to 176 Japanese rice cultivars, including 86 cultivars used in Japanese-sake brewing that Kobe University has maintained over many years. Using next-generation sequencing, the group determined the whole sequence of each cultivar, and discovered a total of 493,881 of the DNA-based polymorphisms. Based on these results, the team carried out GWAS analysis on each trait and rapidly identified four genes within a group of 12 rice plant chromosomes. Chromosome 1 contains a gene that decides rice flowering date; chromosome 4 contains a gene that influences panicle number produced, leaf breadth, and rice grain number; a chromosome 8 gene affects awn length (a factor which influences harvesting); and a gene within chromosome 11 decides flowering date, plant height, and panicle length. Genetic analysis of plants based on GWAS has been carried out many times but with limited success. The success of this experiment could aid the discovery of genes in other plant and animal species and potentially contribute towards solving food shortages caused by population growth. The Japanese rice varieties maintained by Kobe University and used in this research could be used as valuable genetic resources to help identify other genes and breed new crop species.","Published: June 29, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/hiv-structure-stabilized-196965,HIV Structure Stabilized Findings represent  big accomplishment  in biomedical engineering and design  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Want to catch a criminal? Show a mugshot on the news. Want to stop HIV infections? Get the immune system to recognize and attack the virus s tell-tale structure. That s part of the basic approach behind efforts at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) to design an AIDS vaccine. This strategy may hinge on finding new ways to stabilize proteins called HIV-1 surface antigens and in designing HIV-like particles to prompt the body to fight the real virus. Now two new studies led by TSRI scientists advance these efforts. The first describes a strategy to stabilize an important HIV structure and potentially create HIV lookalikes for large-scale vaccine production. The second study engineers novel nanoparticles as vaccine candidates, using this new knowledge.  This is a big accomplishment in terms of engineering and design,  said TSRI biologist Jiang Zhu. Zhu co-led the first study with Ian Wilson, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and chair of the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at TSRI, and co-led the second with TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward. The findings were published June 28, 2016 in the journal Nature Communications. Stabilizing HIV In the first publication, Zhu and researcher Leo Kong (a study first author now at the National Institutes of Health) built on previous structural studies from the Ward and Wilson labs to investigate a trait called  metastability.  Metastability describes the tense state of the HIV Envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer when it is poised like a loaded spring to undergo the dramatic changes that allow the virus to enter cells. Metastability poses a problem for scientists who want to create a precise image of this viral target and see what the human immune system is up against. Metastability also stands in the way of naturally occurring immunity and vaccine production. For the adaptive immune system to work in either case, it needs to recognize a functional, stable version of a virus s proteins a sort of mugshot so it can produce antibodies and attack the actual virus upon encountering it. Unfortunately, because of the virus s metastability, or shape-shifting tendency, structures of HIV s proteins have proven difficult to establish for use in vaccine design. The Ward and Wilson groups at TSRI have previously determined cryo-EM and x-ray structures for other Env constructs; however, current methods to stabilize Env in one strain of HIV won t necessarily stabilize it in another, making it hard to design an arsenal of Env proteins to help elicit  broadly neutralizing antibodies  that could fight many types of HIV. To advance the vaccine effort, TSRI researchers wanted to track down the root cause of metastability, and Jiang and Kong hypothesized that altering a key region of Env would improve its overall properties. They hypothesized that a region of the Env called HR1 could be linked to metastability.  The HR1 basically resembles a highly bent twig that is ready to spring back straight,  said Kong.  This small bend in the HR1 region is likely ground zero for metastability. In most published Env structures, this region appears disordered when mutated or loosely packed when in its native form. From these observations, it seemed reasonable that rewiring the HR1 bend could greatly stabilize Env.  Indeed, when the scientists tweaked HIV s genetic sequence, they were able to shorten the HR1 region, preventing its transformation and keeping the rest of the structure stable.  We ve figured out one of the fundamental reasons why HIV is metastable,  said Zhu. The researchers then demonstrated that their stabilized Env trimers also almost perfectly mimicked the structure of the real HIV trimer, suggesting they could be useful in vaccines. Since rewiring the HR1 should prevent Env undergoing its necessary shape-shifting changes to infect cells, the stabilization strategy also could lead to protein or DNA-based vaccines. Furthermore, the modified trimer also has the potential to be produced in reasonably large quantities and at high purity important considerations in industrial-scale vaccine production. Finally, since many viruses contain metastable Env proteins with HR1-like regions, this TSRI-developed engineering approach may be applicable in the design of vaccines against other viral pathogens such as influenza and Ebola virus. New Vaccine Candidates In the second paper, the researchers looked into designing nanoparticles that could mimic HIV. Particles aren t new in vaccine design. They provide the backbone of successful vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B and hepatitis E the most efficacious human vaccines ever made,  according to Zhu. These nanoparticles are called virus-like particles (VLPs) and are hollow shells of other proteins found in nature. Scientists have found that they can add viral proteins to the outside of a shell, creating a phony virus. The imposter then prompts the body to produce antibodies for long-term protection against the real virus. But as Zhu and his colleagues focused on creating HIV-like VLPs, the Env trimer, once again, presented a challenge. The trimer is made of three subunits that come together to form a base with a crown shape on top. The top of the crown is where the tips of the three subunits meet. Scientists have found that the immune system cannot produce broadly neutralizing antibodies when a vaccine contains only one part of the trimer. The immune system needs to see intact HIV proteins also called antigens when they stimulate the immune system to create antibodies in their native trimeric context. To construct an artificial virus, in the new study the researchers added HIV trimers to nanoparticles that naturally lock their own subunits together in clusters of three. As the three subunits come together, the researchers hypothesized, they could bring the HIV antigens together to form a trimer.  Our idea was to  fuse  a trimeric HIV-1 antigen to a nanoparticle subunit, so when the subunits  self-assemble  they bring three attached HIV-1 antigens together,  said TSRI Staff Scientist Linling He, who served as co-first author of the study with Natalia de Val, a researcher at TSRI at the time of the study. It was a feat of geometry and engineering and it worked.  It has been really challenging to properly present HIV Env on nanoparticles while keeping its natural trimeric form but we did it,  said Zhu,  Multiple copies of Env are now displayed on the nanoparticle surface, just like what a real virus would do.  The team then tested different nanoparticles and versions of the trimer, including one based on the stabilized Env in the first study, to find the best combinations. Six designs worked well in laboratory tests and now await trials in animal models.  We are still pushing hard to find new vaccine candidates to elicit a protective response in humans,  said Wilson.  The challenges going forward are to understand how to use these new vaccine candidates to induce a protective broadly neutralizing antibody response and to develop the appropriate regimens to initiative this response.  In addition to Zhu, Wilson, Ward, Kong, He and de Val, authors of the first study,  Uncleaved prefusion-optimized gp140 trimers derived from analysis of HIV-1 envelope metastability,  were Nemil Vora, Charles D. Morris, Parisa Azadnia and Bin Zhou of TSRI; Devin Sok of TSRI, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Neutralizing Antibody Center and Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery (CAVD), and TSRI Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology & Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID); and Dennis R.

There are no known triggers, and diagnosis requires lengthy tests administered by an expert. Now, for the first time, Cornell University researchers report they have identified biological markers of the disease in gut bacteria and inflammatory microbial agents in the blood. In a study published June 23 in the journal Microbiome, the team describes how they correctly diagnosed myalgic encephalomyeletis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in 83 percent of patients through stool samples and blood work, offering a noninvasive diagnosis and a step toward understanding the cause of the disease.  Our work demonstrates that the gut bacterial microbiome in chronic fatigue syndrome patients isn t normal, perhaps leading to gastrointestinal and inflammatory symptoms in victims of the disease,  said Maureen Hanson, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Cornell and the paper s senior author.  Furthermore, our detection of a biological abnormality provides further evidence against the ridiculous concept that the disease is psychological in origin.   In the future, we could see this technique as a complement to other noninvasive diagnoses, but if we have a better idea of what is going on with these gut microbes and patients, maybe clinicians could consider changing diets, using prebiotics such as dietary fibers or probiotics to help treat the disease,  said Ludovic Giloteaux, a postdoctoral researcher and first author of the study. In the study, Ithaca campus researchers collaborated with Dr. Susan Levine, an ME/CFS specialist in New York City, who recruited 48 people diagnosed with ME/CFS and 39 healthy controls to provide stool and blood samples. The researchers sequenced regions of microbial DNA from the stool samples to identify different types of bacteria. Overall, the diversity of types of bacteria was greatly reduced and there were fewer bacterial species known to be anti-inflammatory in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy people, an observation also seen in people with Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis. At the same time, the researchers discovered specific markers of inflammation in the blood, likely due to a leaky gut from intestinal problems that allow bacteria to enter the blood, Giloteaux said. Bacteria in the blood will trigger an immune response, which could worsen symptoms. The researchers have no evidence to distinguish whether the altered gut microbiome is a cause or a whether it is a consequence of disease, Giloteaux added. In the future, the research team will look for evidence of viruses and fungi in the gut, to see whether one of these or an association of these along with bacteria may be causing or contributing to the illness. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.","Published: June 29, 2016"

The new findings, published in the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, suggest that future therapies might target this protein, called GlyRS, to halt cancer growth.  We have potentially found an important target for anti-cancer treatment,  said TSRI Professor Xiang-Lei Yang, who led the study. Catching a Double Agent Since the early days of life on Earth, GlyRS has played a role in protein synthesis, helping cells function and grow. The new study, a collaboration with Professor Patrick Griffin s lab on the Florida campus of TSRI, reveals that GlyRS is actually a double agent in addition to its biologically essential role in making proteins, it can help to further modify proteins in a way that launches cancer growth. The researchers found that overexpression of GlyRS may lead to too little p27 a protein than Yang compared to a stop sign for cell growth. Specifically, the team found that GlyRS creates a protective shield around a modifier protein, called NEDD8, and safely  chaperones  it to meet its target protein, called cullin. With NEDD8 in place, cullin is activated to degrade p27. Kept at the right levels, p27 regulates the cell cycle, stopping potential cancer growth. But when GlyRS levels increase, too much p27 gets degraded and cells multiply unchecked.   Cancer cells hijack and over-exaggerate the system,  said TSRI Research Associate Zhongying Mo, first author of the study.  This can lead to tumorigenesis.  This process is especially dangerous given GlyRS s additional function in protein synthesis, which supplies cancers with the proteins they need to keep growing.  Ultimately, both functions are linked to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis,  Yang said. Indeed, when Mo analyzed data from a breast cancer tissue database, she found that patients with increased GlyRS had higher mortality. Although this research is at the basic stage, the team believes it could guide future cancer diagnostics and therapies. For example, measuring GlyRS may provide a marker to help doctors predict how quickly a patient s cancer might progress. The team now plans to study the effects of GlyRS in different types of cancer and the possibility of developing a drug to inhibit GlyRS. In addition to Yang, Griffin and Mo, authors of the study  Neddylation requires glycyl-tRNA synthetase to protect activated E2,  were Qian Zhang, Ze Liu, Yi Shi and Litao Sun of TSRI s California campus and Janelle Lauer of TSRI s Florida campus.

The findings, based on testing in mice, will appear this week in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which causes the deadly anthrax disease, produces a toxin made of three proteins that individually are non-toxic. Because the proteins can be engineered to suppress tumor growth they have emerged as a potential cancer therapy. Until now, however, scientists have been unsure how the anthrax toxin proteins control tumor growth. In this study, NIH scientists used mouse models to show that anthrax toxin proteins work by specifically targeting the cells that line the inner walls of the blood vessels feeding the tumor. The proteins, which reach these cells through a surface receptor called CMG2, prevent the cells from reproducing. Because the toxin does not target the tumor cells themselves but rather the host-derived blood vessel cells, the strategy could be efficacious for a wide range of tumor types, the NIH team notes. Unfortunately, the immune system produces antibodies in response to the anthrax toxin proteins, making additional courses of treatment ineffective. To circumvent this problem, the investigators examined in mice whether a regimen of the chemotherapy drugs pentostatin and cyclophosphamide (PC) could block production of the antibodies that neutralize the anthrax toxin proteins. Mice were inoculated with tumors and treated with one of the following regimens: saline (for use as a placebo), anthrax toxin protein therapy, PC, or a combined regimen of anthrax toxin protein therapy and PC. After four cycles of therapy (42 days), all mice receiving the combined regimen were alive, whereas mice in the other groups had to be euthanized due to tumor growth. In addition, the investigators could not detect any neutralizing antibodies in the combined regimen group, even after the fourth round of therapy. Together, the results showed that the combined anthrax toxin protein and PC therapy has durable, anti-tumor effects worthy of further exploration, according to the authors.","Published: June 29, 2016"

The study is expected to commence shortly after receipt of regulatory approval, anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. The Phase 2a study, named the COMBAT study, is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of BL-8040 and KEYTRUDA  (pembrolizumab), MSD s anti-PD-1 therapy, in up to 30 subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study is designed to evaluate the clinical response, safety and tolerability of the combination of these therapies as well as multiple pharmacodynamic parameters, including the ability to improve infiltration of T cells into the tumor and their reactivity. It is expected to take place in the US, Israel and additional territories. In January 2016, BioLineRx entered into a collaboration with MSD, known as Merck in the US and Canada, to support a Phase 2 study investigating BioLineRx s BL-8040 in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. BL-8040, BioLineRx s lead oncology platform, is a CXCR4 antagonist that has been shown in several clinical trials to be a robust mobilizer of immune cells and to be effective at inducing direct tumor cell death. Additional findings in the field of immuno-oncology suggest that CXCR4 antagonists may be effective in inducing the infiltration of anti-tumor T cells into the tumor. Therefore, when combined with KEYTRUDA, which blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells, BL-8040 has the potential to enable activated T cells to better reach tumor cells in the fight against pancreatic cancer.

Aligned with the environment by external forces such as sunlight and ambient temperature, circadian rhythms are important for animal health and survival. Disturbances of the circadian clock are associated with a variety of diseases in humans and animals, including cancer, mental illnesses and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. See Also: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions The dominant role of light in adjusting the circadian rhythm to the local environment has consistently been emphasized in studies on individually-isolated animals in laboratories. Interactions with others of the same species, while very important for animal survival and fitness in nature, are not considered important external stimuli that affect the animal circadian clock. Now, a study conducted by researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and published in the journal Nature Communications challenges this view. The researchers performed a set of large scale experiments in which they manipulated social interactions and light exposure for more than 1,000 honeybees in cages, or in freely foraging colonies housed in observation hives, allowing research in an ecologically relevant context. Every experiment was repeated two to four times, each with bees from a different source colony (which were genetically different). Nurse honey bees in observation hive monitored during experiments by Hebrew University researchers. Credit: Muki Nagari ""We show for the first time that social time cues stably adjust the clock, even in animals experiencing conflicting light exposure and social cycles,"" said Prof. Guy Bloch from the Department of Ecology, Evolution & Behavior at The Hebrew University's Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, who led the study. The researchers collected a massive data set which demonstrated that in honeybees, social interactions can override potent light exposure as external cues that influence the biological clock. Learn More: Setting the circadian clock The data showed that resetting the circadian rhythm by manipulating the social environment had a robust and stable effect for several days even for 2-day-old bees, which are typically active around the clock with no overt circadian rhythms. Remarkably, young bees that experienced conflicting light and social cycles showed a phase that was more similar to the social cycle. When removed from the hive and monitored individually in constant laboratory conditions, they maintained the phase of the social cycle, meaning this potent social factor does not depend on physical contact with other bees in the colony. ""This study provides the strongest available evidence for the power of social entrainment, and emphasizes the importance of studying circadian rhythms in a species-specific, ecologically-relevant context,"" said Prof. Bloch. Social insects are ecologically important and offer attractive model systems for studies on the interplay between social behavior and circadian rhythms. The best evidence for the influence of social activity on the internal clock is found in dark cavity-dwelling social animals, such as bees and bats. These species may be especially responsive to social influence, because individuals may not experience ambient conditions directly, but rather rely on information received from group mates that forage outside their domicile. This study adds to recent research showing the circadian rhythms in complex natural environments may profoundly differ from those in controlled laboratory conditions. ""Studies in the real world will provide a better understanding of the function and regulation of biological clocks,"" said Prof. Bloch. Related: Scientists discover protein that controls the strength of body's circadian rhythms The study also indicates that social signals may be important time-givers for the clocks of other animals, including mammals, and could contribute to the research on sleep and behavioral disorders, as well as for the understanding of the complex life of bee societies.

That's what National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST) researchers (U.S.) advised collaborators hunting for molecules that, by linking to a normally occurring enzyme, rev up the brain's capacity for clearing cholesterol a boost associated with improvements in memory and other benefits in animal studies. See Also: Promising Alzheimer s treatment moves toward clinical trials The target pinpointed by the NIST scientists is where an approved anti-HIV drug efavirenz latches to the enzyme already responsible for about 80 percent of the cholesterol elimination from the human brain. Obtained with a cutting-edge atom-substitution technology called hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX), the molecular roadmap shows how small amounts of the drug can kick the enzyme, called CYP46A1, into higher gear. With this information, a team led by Irina Pikuleva of Case Western Reserve University now has the full story behind the drug's mechanism of action, key evidence in their proposal to launch clinical trials of efavirenz as an Alzheimer's treatment. The analytical sleuthing that exposed the dynamics of the cholesterol-clearing connection was reported in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Analyses of NIST's HDX data and follow-on experiments helped to explain why, in studies of mice, tiny doses of efavirenz ramped up CYP46A1's cholesterol-removal capability while larger doses had an inhibiting effect. The explanation: At low doses, efavirenz binds to a site on the enzyme that boosts cholesterol breakdown at another location on the enzyme, an increase enabled by changes in shape initiated by the drug. At higher doses, however, drug molecules begin to compete with cholesterol for the same site where cholesterol normally binds. The shape-changing effect of efavirenz ""is a classic example of a basic tenet of biology structure determines function,"" Pikuleva said. And the effect can be dramatic. Learn More: New Alzheimer s drug to enter clinical trials In mouse studies, the enzyme-drug connection triggered a 40 percent increase in cholesterol breakdown and removal from the brain. In people, the boost is likely to be significantly higher, Pikuleva said, since the enzyme plays a larger disposal role in the human brain than in the mouse's. Studies of over the past 15 years persuaded Pikuleva's team to pursue an Alzheimer's treatment strategy focused on ratcheting up the cholesterol-clearing capabilities of CYP46A1, part of a large family of iron-containing enzymes that strongly influence how the body processes drugs. Studies by other scientists that used genetic manipulations in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease showed that cranking up CYP46A1's activity reduced development of plaque, or clumps of protein pieces called beta amyloids. These studies also reported improvements in memory and learning. And, even in plaque-free, normal mice, increased cholesterol removal resulted in memory improvement. Conversely, mouse studies also found that suppressing CYP46A1 led to learning deficiencies.Focusing on efavirenz as part of its strategy to ""repurpose"" already-approved drugs, the Case Western team set out to uncover how the drug stimulates the enzyme's activity. Computational simulations and modeling suggested more than 30 locations on the enzyme where efavirenz molecule might bind. Seeking to winnow down the options, Pikuleva turned to Kyle Anderson and colleagues at the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, a partnership between NIST and the University of Maryland. In HDX analyses, proteins are immersed in ""heavy water,"" in which normal hydrogen, containing a single proton in its nucleus, is replaced by deuterium, a rarer type of hydrogen whose nucleus holds both a proton and neutron. Protein and heavy water exchange hydrogen and deuterium. As the protein swaps out hydrogen for heavier deuterium, its mass increases. The process involves a series of steps that include quenching--or locking in the deuterium in the protein--and then breaking the protein into electrically charged fragments for analysis. With a device called a mass spectrometer, researchers can measure the mass of these fragments to determine how quickly these protein pieces exchange hydrogen for deuterium. A protein fragment that is largely exposed to water will have a fast exchange rate, but a fragment that comes from a site buried inside the protein or is covered up by a molecule binding to the protein will have a slower exchange rate. ""HDX mass spectrometry opens a window that allows you to look in on how proteins behave under physiologically relevant conditions,"" Anderson explained. ""It provides the pieces to a puzzle that you can assemble to show how their three-dimensional shape changes over time."" Related: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression The NIST team used HDX to compare and contrast CYP46A1 in four different states: alone, with cholesterol only, with efavirenz only, and with cholesterol and efavirenz. Subsequent analyses of the resulting torrents of experimental data a computationally intensive process that Anderson performed in triplicate to ensure accuracy revealed not only where the drug attached to the enzyme but also how the cholesterol-binding site adjusted in response. The structural changes enabled CYP46A1 to bind cholesterol molecules more tightly than in the absence of the drug. Following up with a study using a different method, Pikuleva's team further confirmed the site of efavirenz binding as determined with HDX. The evidence strongly suggests, she said, at doses a hundred times lower than prescribed for treating HIV, efavirenz might be an effective therapy for stimulating cholesterol turnover from the brain and slowing or preventing Alzheimer's disease. Pikuleva and colleagues now are seeking to obtain funding for a clinical trial on humans to investigate the effects of small doses of efavirenz.

Rett syndrome is a childhood disorder that typically manifests after the first birthday. Early symptoms include delayed development and poor coordination while, during the second stage, a child will gradually or suddenly develop severe problems with communication, language, learning, co-ordination and other brain functions. It can cause seizures, breathing difficulties and sometimes premature death. See Also: Effective drugs for Parkinson's found to reduce symptoms of Rett syndrome in mice Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene which makes a protein with a similar name, MeCP2, that is essential for proper function of neurons in the brain. When MeCP2 is missing from all cells, mice develop symptoms similar to those seen in Rett syndrome and male mice die prematurely. The two major types of neurons in the brain are excitatory neurons, which send signals to other neurons telling them to be active, and inhibitory neurons, which stop or dampen the activity of other neurons to control the timing and rate of incoming information. These neurons must act in balance with each other for the brain to work correctly, otherwise disruptions can lead to the onset of neurological disorders. One study in mice, published in the journal eLife, shows that expressing MeCP2 only in inhibitory neurons increases lifespan and rescues most but not all behavioral deficits. A second study, published at the same time in eLife, shows that removing MeCP2 only from excitatory neurons in mice contributed to the onset of several Rett-like symptoms, some of which are distinct and complementary to those mediated by inhibitory neurons. ""Together, our findings show that rescuing the activity of MeCP2 in certain cell types can have a profound effect on improving symptoms,"" says Huda Zoghbi, senior author of both papers and a recent winner of the Shaw Prize for her research leading to the discovery of the gene causing Rett syndrome. Related: Mouse version of an autism spectrum disorder improves when diet includes a synthetic oil Approximately one in every 10-12,000 females are affected by the disorder, while it is much rarer in males who have more severe symptoms and die early in life. The two studies showed that MeCP2 is important for both inhibitory and excitatory neurons in terms of motor function and survival, but also revealed that each type of neuron is key for distinct neuropsychiatric features. For the first study, the team asked if expressing MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons, while the gene remains missing from the rest of the body, would be enough to prevent some or all of the symptoms seen in the Rett syndrome mouse model. ""Our data suggest that when a brain is missing MeCP2 everywhere, turning on the gene in inhibitory neurons can make the brain network nearly normal and prevent most Rett-like symptoms,"" says Kerstin Ure, Postdoctoral Fellow and lead author of the study. ""However, when both normal cells and cells with mutated MeCP2 are present in the same brain, as seen in female mutant mice, the abnormalities caused by this mixture cannot be overcome just by rescuing the function of inhibitory neurons. This highlights the importance of doing future studies in female mice to better understand how Rett syndrome develops."" Taking these new insights into account, the authors of the second paper set out to learn what aspects of the syndrome would appear or recover if MeCP2 was removed or re-expressed in excitatory neurons. ""We showed that mice lacking the gene from these neurons develop tremor and anxiety-like behaviors, abnormal seizure-like brain activity, severe obesity, and early death, which is surprisingly different from mice missing MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons,"" says Xiangling Meng, a neuroscience graduate student at Baylor College of Medicine, and lead author of the second study. Learn More: In mice, experimental drug treatment for Rett syndrome suggests the disorder is reversible""When the gene was re-expressed in excitatory neurons, the female mice were almost completely recovered. In the case of more severe males, their anxiety and tremors were rescued, suggesting that impairment of excitatory neurons by removing MeCP2 contributes to the onset of specific symptoms such as these."" The team believes the next steps will be to investigate if drugs that improve the function of both inhibitory and excitatory neuron activity can be used for treating patients with Rett syndrome. Further studies will be focused on improving the function of these neurons in the hope of restoring the balance between them. Zoghbi adds: ""For now, we are looking at different ways of activating inhibitory neurons in the female mouse brain, including testing drugs and special channels that can activate a cell when a specific chemical is given to the mice. We hope these methods will help us refine a path forward for potential new therapies for patients."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

This finding emerges from a Weizmann Institute study published in Science. See Also: The immune system, microglia, and the brain The study may explain, among other things, how the mother's infection with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) during pregnancy, which affects her own and her fetus's immune system, increases the risk that her offspring will develop autism or schizophrenia, sometimes years later. This increased risk of neurodevelopmental diseases had been discovered many years ago in epidemiological studies and confirmed in mouse models. The Weizmann study, led by Dr. Ido Amit and Prof. Michal Schwartz, of the Immunology and Neurobiology Departments, respectively, provides a possible explanation for this increase on the cellular and the mechanistic molecular levels. ""Previous studies had shown that the timing of the disruption in the mother's immune system during pregnancy affects the type of brain damage her child may develop. For example, a viral infection in early pregnancy raises the risk of autism, whereas an infection later in the pregnancy raises the risk of schizophrenia,"" said Amit. ""We've set out to examine the mechanisms behind these phenomena, while focusing on the role the immune system plays in brain development."" Orit Matcovitch-Natan, a graduate student in the laboratories of both Amit and Schwartz, and other members of the two teams, studied the sole immune cells present in the brain the microglia, which contribute to the brain's development and maintenance. The scientists discovered that the development of these cells in the mouse fetus and in newborn mice proceeds in three distinct stages, parallel to those of the developing brain: early cells that populate the brain of the embryo shortly after its inception, pre-microglia and adult cells. By screening the genomes of these cells and testing them extensively, the scientists were able to define each stage in terms of its activated genes, their control mechanisms and the epigenetic features, that is, the activation of proteins that ""package"" the DNA and affect gene expression in the course of development. The scientists also characterized the functions of some of these genes in the microglia, which contributed to an in-depth understanding of the developmental processes. Learn More: Body s immune system may play larger role in Alzheimer s disease than thought The second stage that of the pre-microglia proved the most sensitive to disruptions. This stage takes place close to birth and shortly afterwards, just when the developing brain undergoes the vital process of ""pruning,"" in which inappropriate synapses among neurons are lopped off. The pre-microglia play an important role in pruning, helping remove the superfluous neuronal networks, and shaping and strengthening the connections among the remaining neurons. When the scientists exposed the brains of pregnant mice to synthetic materials that mimic a CMV infection, they found that the development of the pre-microglia was disrupted in their offspring. Genes involved in the maturation of these cells were expressed at the wrong time, and the cells proceeded to an adult stage earlier than usual. The offspring later exhibited abnormal behavior, including disturbances in social interaction and behaviors similar to those of people with schizophrenia. ""We've discovered that it's essential for the development of immune cells in the brain to be synchronized with the development of the brain itself,"" says Schwartz. ""Premature shift of the microglia in mice to the adult stage leads to brain malfunction later on."" Though these findings have been obtained in mice, the scientists hypothesize that disrupted coordination between the development of the microglia and that of the brain contributes to an increased risk of such neurodevelopmental disorders as autism and schizophrenia in human beings. The scientists believe that the heightened immune response to viral infection in the mother's body may be responsible for disrupting the timing of microglia development. ""Our research has paved the way for studying the effects of other viruses on the mother's immune system in general, and on her offspring's brain development. It can also advance the study of neurodevelopmental disorders and their connection to the immune system,"" says Orit Matcovitch-Natan. Don't Miss: Missing link found between brain, immune system -- with major disease implicationsIn yet another series of experiments, the Weizmann scientists established a connection between the development of the microglia in the brains of mice and intestinal microbes the microbiome. They found that in newborn mice that were free of any microbes, the maturation of the microglia was delayed. This finding suggests that in human babies, factors that shape the microbiome - natural ones such as breastfeeding, or therapeutic, such as antibiotics may affect the immune cells in the baby's brain and consequently the brain's development. It's still unknown to what extent this research, conducted in mice, is relevant to human beings, but the scientists hope that an improved understanding of this process may in the future help prevent certain neurological disorders in babies, caused by disruptions in the mother's immune system.

There are no known triggers, and diagnosis requires lengthy tests administered by an expert. Now, for the first time, Cornell University researchers report they have identified biological markers of the disease in gut bacteria and inflammatory microbial agents in the blood. See Also: Study shows why exercise magnifies exhaustion for chronic fatigue syndrome patients In a study published in the journal Microbiome, the team describes how they correctly diagnosed myalgic encephalomyeletis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in 83 percent of patients through stool samples and blood work, offering a noninvasive diagnosis and a step toward understanding the cause of the disease. ""Our work demonstrates that the gut bacterial microbiome in chronic fatigue syndrome patients isn't normal, perhaps leading to gastrointestinal and inflammatory symptoms in victims of the disease,"" said Maureen Hanson, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Cornell and the paper's senior author. ""Furthermore, our detection of a biological abnormality provides further evidence against the ridiculous concept that the disease is psychological in origin."" ""In the future, we could see this technique as a complement to other noninvasive diagnoses, but if we have a better idea of what is going on with these gut microbes and patients, maybe clinicians could consider changing diets, using prebiotics such as dietary fibers or probiotics to help treat the disease,"" said Ludovic Giloteaux, a postdoctoral researcher and first author of the study. In the study, Ithaca campus researchers collaborated with Dr. Susan Levine, an ME/CFS specialist in New York City, who recruited 48 people diagnosed with ME/CFS and 39 healthy controls to provide stool and blood samples. The researchers sequenced regions of microbial DNA from the stool samples to identify different types of bacteria. Overall, the diversity of types of bacteria was greatly reduced and there were fewer bacterial species known to be anti-inflammatory in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy people, an observation also seen in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. At the same time, the researchers discovered specific markers of inflammation in the blood, likely due to a leaky gut from intestinal problems that allow bacteria to enter the blood, Giloteaux said.

Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes anthrax, is recognized as one of the most significant bioterrorism threats. It produces three main components that allow it to cause disease lethal toxin, edema toxin, and capsule. During anthrax infection, the bacterium invades and grows to high concentrations in the host. The capsule surrounds the bacterium and prevents it from being ingested and destroyed by the white blood cells, thus allowing anthrax infection to progress. The toxins are thought to act mainly by damaging the body s natural defense mechanisms.  Current human vaccines for anthrax are based on the protective antigen component of the anthrax toxins. Scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) have extensively studied protective antigen, demonstrating that protective antigen alone confers protection in animal challenge studies with both rabbits and monkeys.  However, according to senior author Arthur M. Friedlander, M.D., of USAMRIID, concerns about reliance on a single antigen as well as the issue of protecting against anthrax strains that may be vaccine resistant have prompted the search for additional vaccine components. Bacterial capsules are commonly used in licensed vaccines for other diseases, including certain types of pneumonia and meningitis.  Friedlander s group had already demonstrated in published studies that the anthrax capsule plays a role in conferring protection. In their current work, the team describes testing a higher dose of the capsule vaccine in monkeys against a lethal aerosol challenge with anthrax spores. All the animals receiving the capsule vaccine survived while all non-vaccinated animals succumbed to the disease.   In the 140-year history of research on anthrax there have been two previous types of vaccine, the last one licensed in 1970,  Friedlander said.  This new capsule vaccine is expected to work against possible vaccine-resistant strains of anthrax and to protect individuals who may not respond optimally to protective antigen alone. In addition, it could be combined with protective antigen to create a multi-component vaccine that may enhance the efficacy of protective antigen- based vaccines. ","Published: June 28, 2016"

The cancer, known as disseminated neoplasia, is a leukemia-like disease that affects bivalves in many parts of the world. Direct transmission of cancer cells is quite rare. Until recently, the phenomenon had only been observed in two species of mammals. Last year, Dr. Goff s team found a third example in the soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) after initially suspecting that the culprit behind the cancer cluster was a virus. The team then wondered if cancers in other mollusks are also caused by contagious cells. To find out, Dr. Goff s team examined the DNA of cancers and normal tissue from mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus) collected from the coasts of Canada and Spain. In each species, the researchers discovered that the cancers were caused by independent clones of cancer cells that were genetically distinct from their hosts. They also found that in one species, the carpet shell clam, the infectious cancer cells came from a related but distinct species.

The cancer, known as disseminated neoplasia, is a leukemia-like disease that affects bivalves in many parts of the world. Direct transmission of cancer cells is quite rare. Until recently, the phenomenon had only been observed in two species of mammals. Last year, Dr. Goff s team found a third example in the soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) after initially suspecting that the culprit behind the cancer cluster was a virus. The team then wondered if cancers in other mollusks are also caused by contagious cells. To find out, Dr. Goff s team examined the DNA of cancers and normal tissue from mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus) collected from the coasts of Canada and Spain. In each species, the researchers discovered that the cancers were caused by independent clones of cancer cells that were genetically distinct from their hosts. They also found that in one species, the carpet shell clam, the infectious cancer cells came from a related but distinct species. The researchers concluded that this cancer was due to a case of cross-species transmission.  Now that we have observed the spread of cancer among several marine species, our future research will investigate the mutations that are responsible for these cancer cell transmissions,  said Dr. Goff.","Published: June 28, 2016"

Mycobacteria cause various illnesses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the main representative of this genus, is the causative agent of tuberculosis, which killed around 1.5 million people worldwide in 2014. Nontuberculous mycobacteria can trigger pulmonary infections, lymph node infections and skin diseases in patients with compromised immune systems. On account of more and more people with chronic lung diseases and the success of transplants, these difficult-to-treat infections have been on the rise continuously in recent decades. A few days instead of several weeks A research group from the Institute of Medical Microbiology at the University of Zurich and the National Centre for Mycobacteria used a large-scale study with more than 6,800 patient samples to examine molecular-based methods for the detection of mycobacterial pathogens. Because many mycobacteria only grow at a very slow pace, routine detection using bacteria cultures in highly specialized and expensive high-safety labs takes several weeks to complete. The subsequent susceptibility test to determine the appropriate medicine also takes one to two weeks.  For patients and doctors, this long waiting period is an unnecessary test of their patience , says Dr. Peter Keller from the Institute of Medical Microbiology at the UZH.  By comparison, with molecular detection methods, most patients know after one or two days whether they have an infection with tuberculosis pathogens or with nontuberculous mycobacteria.  For their study, the researchers developed a diagnostic algorithm to detect mycobacteria directly from the patient sample using genetic analysis. With this ultra-fast molecular detection method, the patient samples were examined continuously over three years and compared with the results from the bacteria cultures for more than 3,000 patients. The new molecular-based methods were found to be just as accurate as the lengthy culture-based techniques used to date. Testing resistance to standard medicines In addition, the molecular analysis makes it possible for the first time to also detect the nontuberculous mycobacteria directly from the patient sample within just a few hours. This means that suitable therapeutic measures can be initiated much more quickly. By contrast, if the patient has a tuberculosis infection, a further molecular assay is carried out to test susceptibility to the main tuberculosis drugs  rifampicin  and  isoniazid .  This also showed that the molecular-based method reliably predicts the culture-based resistance results. It is possible to obtain certainty much sooner of whether the therapy with standard medicines chosen is likely to be successful , explains Keller.","Published: June 28, 2016"

The stem cells were developed by isolating human umbilical cord blood cells following a healthy birth, and coaxing them back into a pluripotent state, or one in which they have the potential to develop into any cell type in the body. Cells developed in this manner are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). With NIH support, these cells were manufactured by Lonza, Walkersville, Maryland, and described in a publication by Behnam Baghbaderani, Ph.D., and colleagues in Stem Cell Reports. These clinical-grade stem cells are different from the more common laboratory-grade cells   those used in most scientific publications   because unlike laboratory-grade stem cells, clinical-grade stem cells can be used for clinical applications in humans. The distinctive feature of this cell line is that it was developed under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), a set of stringent regulations enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which ensures each batch of cells produced will meet quality and safety standards required for potential clinical use. The NIH Common Fund s Regenerative Medicine program supported the manufacturing of this cell line.  The Common Fund aims to accelerate research progress by developing new tools and resources for the biomedical research community through strategic investments in high-impact research,  said James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, which houses the Common Fund.  Since meeting cGMP guidelines is very time-intensive and costly, providing access to clinical-grade stem cells removes a significant barrier in the development of cell-based therapies.  Significant progress with stem cell therapy in mice is already underway. Researchers have reversed diabetic conditions in mice using iPSC-generated insulin-producing cells and have partially restored limb function in mice with spinal cord injuries. Translating these studies into humans is the next challenge, and by making clinical-grade stem cells available, NIH hopes to speed up the development of new stem cell therapies for patients. The clinical-grade stem cells, as well as research-grade cells cultured from the same cell line, are available for order and will be stored and distributed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Human Cell and Data Repository (NHCDR) (link is external) that is supported through a NINDS grant to RUCDR Infinite Biologics at Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey. RUCDR also distributes laboratory-grade cell lines made by the NIH Regenerative Medicine Program. Laboratory-grade cells can be used for research that lays the foundation for eventual use of clinical-grade cells, such as determining the conditions necessary to guide the iPSCs to become specific cell types like neurons, insulin-producing beta-cells, or heart cells.  As part of our longstanding commitment to providing critical biospecimens of the highest quality to investigators around the world, we share the excitement of being able to provide access to this resource,  said Dr. Michael Sheldon, director of the Stem Cell Center at RUCDR.  The Regenerative Medicine Program s laboratory-grade stem cells are frequently requested by researchers. Given the therapeutic potential of the cGMP clinical-grade stem cells we anticipate a strong demand from both the academic and corporate sectors.  The Regenerative Medicine Program supported the manufacturing of the clinical-grade stem cell line as part of its mission to serve as a national resource for stem cell science to accelerate the development of new medical applications and cell-based therapies. Another avenue through which the Regenerative Medicine Program is fulfilling its mission is through the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) that is funded by the Common Fund and administered by the NIH s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The aim of the SCTL is to remove barriers that currently impede the therapeutic application of iPSCs, which include the lack of highly reproducible and well-defined procedures required to generate, characterize and differentiate patient-specific iPSCs in a safe fashion for pre-clinical and clinical use. In parallel to developing an integrated stem cell research program within NCATS, the SCTL will soon be soliciting collaborations from the research community in order to address the most pressing impediments towards stem cell therapies.","Published: June 28, 2016"

These orphan compounds had been developed to fight other diseases and did not work for their original purpose. Now Keiler aims to discover if they may be viable to be made into effective tuberculosis drugs. Keiler s team was chosen for this collaboration because of his work discovering  trans-translation,  a process in bacteria that ensures protein synthesis is not interrupted. Keiler believes disrupting the trans-translation process is key to stopping the growth of bacterial diseases like tuberculosis. Tuberculosis affects two billion people worldwide and can be found in every country in the world. However, the impact of tuberculosis is felt most strongly in resource-poor nations where patients might not have access to both the medication or regular medical oversight to ensure effective treatment of tuberculosis.  Without constant monitoring, people tend to stop taking the drugs,  said Keiler. Even in the U.S., compliance with taking the full course of tuberculosis medication can be a problem, leading to drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. Part of this is due to the length of treatment time for the disease, said Keiler. Current treatment for tuberculosis involves a cocktail of antibiotics that must be taken for at least six months (but as long as two years) to be effective. Keiler s end goal with this research is to be able to shorten the treatment from six months to two weeks using antibiotics made from molecules that disrupt trans-translation. So far, Keiler s team has identified three families of compounds donated from GSK that could be very promising for new tuberculosis drug development.  We identified several compounds that inhibit the protein quality control pathway that we study,  said Keiler.  We have also learned some important basic science about the quality control pathway from the activity of the molecules.  Keiler s team is currently finishing the molecular experiments and further testing for drug development is planned.","Published: June 28, 2016"

However, there is growing concern among researchers that this idea is not rapidly advancing global understanding of the disease or leading to successful treatments. The University of Adelaide scientists, in collaboration with researchers from a number of other Australian universities, say their analysis points to a new theory about how mutations of a particular gene, PSEN1, can trigger early onset Alzheimer s disease.  Most of the mutations that cause Alzheimer s disease before retirement age are found in the PSEN1 gene,  says study leader, Associate Professor Michael Lardelli, School of Biological Sciences.  Fortunately, this early onset form of Alzheimer s disease accounts for only about 1% of all disease cases. Nevertheless, a huge research effort has focused on these mutations in the hope that advanced genetics analysis techniques might shed light on the still mysterious origins of both early and late onset Alzheimer's disease.  Published in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease, the researchers examined past research on PSEN1 and noted a particular correlation between the types of mutations affecting this gene and whether or not they caused Alzheimer's disease.  ""The protein normally produced by the PSEN1 gene is remarkable since it plays so many different roles in cells,  says Associate Professor Lardelli.  Almost everyone has been looking at how mutated PSEN1 protein affects production of amyloid beta. However, we think a broader, more holistic view of the mutation data not focused on amyloid beta may be telling a different story.  ""There are two pathways that PSEN1 protein can take when it functions in cells. One pathway leads to production of amyloid beta while the second, less-studied pathway controls many other important activities including how cells recycle their components and respond to restricted oxygen availability.  We suggest that changes in this second pathway are better correlated with how mutations affect the structure of PSEN1 protein and the other proteins it interacts with. By taking our focus away from amyloid beta the mutation data seem to make more sense.""  An exciting possibility is that the fundamentals of our idea may be extended to understanding the much more common late onset form of Alzheimer's disease. That is something we are currently investigating with our animal models of the disease,"" says Associate Professor Lardelli.","Published: June 28, 2016"

PCOS is a group of symptoms related to high levels of hormones known as androgens. In many women with the condition, the ovaries contain numerous small, cyst-like sacs. Women with PCOS may have irregular, missing, or prolonged menstrual periods, excessive facial and body hair, insulin resistance, and problems with fertility. Treatment may include drugs that block androgens, and oral contraceptives, which contain the hormones estrogen and progesterone.  Traditionally, treatment for PCOS has included modifying ovarian hormones,  said Constantine Stratakis, M.D., director of intramural research at NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and senior author of the study.  Our findings indicate that a subgroup of patients could conceivably benefit from modification of adrenal hormones as well.  The study was published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. The study s first author is Evgenia Gourgari, M.D., of Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., who was a research fellow at NICHD when the study was conducted. In their article, the researchers noted that earlier studies had found that in some women with PCOS, androgens were produced by the adrenal glands, rather than by the ovaries. On the basis of these observations, the researchers decided to test the adrenal functioning of women with PCOS. A total of 38 women with PCOS volunteered for the study, along with 20 healthy women, who served as a comparison, or control group. They studied the PCOS patients  adrenal functioning with a diagnostic procedure known as Liddle s test, used to diagnose disorders of the adrenal glands. The test consists of a two-part sequence in which women take the drug dexamethasone, which mimics the adrenal hormone cortisol, first in a low dose and then in a high dose. At the end of the test, people with disorders of the adrenal glands often will produce high levels of adrenal hormones. The researchers found that 15 of the 38 PCOS patients produced more adrenal hormones than normal. The women also had adrenal glands that were smaller than normal. The researchers theorize that the women s adrenal glands may resemble those seen in a condition called micronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia in which tiny lumps or nodules appear on the adrenal glands and begin producing adrenal hormones. Because the nodules produce hormones, the adrenals produce fewer hormones and shrink. Dr. Stratakis added that additional studies with a larger number of patients will be needed to examine the adrenal glands of women with PCOS to confirm the study results and to determine whether the women have micronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia or some other condition affecting the adrenal glands.","Published: June 28, 2016"

Researchers are now saying bad gut bacteria or an insufficient amount of good bacteria may have a direct link to multiple sclerosis (MS) as well.

Since the bacteria are associated with contributing to good health, Mangalam and his colleagues wondered whether those with a chronic autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, would then have a gut microbiome that is different than the microbiome found in healthy individuals.

See Also: Researchers open  Golden Window  in deep brain imaging Nervous systems are complex. After all, everything that any animal thinks or does is controlled by its nervous system. To better understand how complex nervous systems work, researchers have used an expanding array of ever more sophisticated tools that allow them to actually see what's going on. In some cases, neuroscience researchers have had to create entirely new tools to advance their work. This is how an electrical engineering researcher ended up co-authoring a Nature Biotechnology paper with a group of neuroscientists. A UNC Chapel Hill research team made up of Jeff Stirman, Ikuko Smith and Spencer Smith wanted to be able to look at ""ensemble"" neuronal activity related to how mice process visual input. In other words, they wanted to look at activity in neurons across multiple areas at the same time. To do that, the researchers used a two-photon microscope, which images fluorescence. In this case, it could be used to see which neurons ""light up"" when active. The problem was that conventional two-photon microscopy systems could only look at approximately one square millimeter of brain tissue at a time. That made it hard to simultaneously capture neuron activity in different areas. This is where Michael Kudenov comes in. An assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State, Kudenov's area of expertise is remote imaging. His work focuses on developing new instruments and sensors to improve the performance of technologies used in everything from biomedical imaging to agricultural research. Learn More: Atomic force microscopy for imaging nanoscale dynamics of neurons After being contacted by the UNC researchers, Kudenov designed a series of new lenses for the microscope. Stirman further refined the designs and incorporated them into an overall two-photon imaging system that allowed the researchers to scan much larger areas of the brain. Instead of capturing images covering one square millimeter of the brain, they could capture images covering more than 9.5 square millimeters. This advance allows them to simultaneously scan widely separated populations of neurons.

""We are working with the Bipolar Sequencing Consortium to gather more data and collaborators so we can definitively figure out causes."" Bipolar disorder is a mental illness characterized by periods of alternating episodes of severe depression and ecstatic mania, with the anguished person trying for a happy medium in the swinging pendulum of high and low moods. Goes says some early genetic studies looking into the cause of the disease used genomewide association studies to search for common, single-letter DNA changes that individually turned out to have very small effects but, in combination, can explain a small proportion of the risk for bipolar disorder. Goes' team used newer gene sequencing technology that instead can read millions of pieces of DNA at the same time to find even rarer genetic mutations that are rare but may have a more severe effect. Initially, Goes' team looked at eight families with a history of bipolar disorder through several generations, likely indicating a significant inherited component. Ultimately, the investigators sequenced the whole genomes of 36 family members with the disease. Examining only the portion of the genome that acts as protein blueprints, they identified 84 rare gene variations that stood out in these family members. To further the case that these 84 variations were connected to the disease, they compared them to versions of the same genes found in 3,541 people with bipolar disease and 4,774 controls without the disease. Although many of these genetic variations were found to be overrepresented in the bipolar cases, the researchers caution that the data weren't powerful enough to show that any specific mutation among the 84 rare mutations directly causes bipolar disorder, noting that patient sample sizes likely in excess of 10,000 cases will be necessary to pinpoint rare mutations within a specific gene. The study did find evidence that genes from this study had previously been implicated in other psychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, which provides additional support for the overlap of autism and schizophrenia risk genes with risk genes in families with bipolar disorder.

The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, validates studies that show rats are emotionally motivated to help other rats in distress. In the latest study, rats treated with midazolam did not open the door to a restrainer device containing a trapped rat, although control rats routinely freed their trapped companions. Midazolam did not interfere with the rats' physical ability to open the restrainer door, however. In fact, when the restrainer device contained chocolate instead of a trapped rat, the test rats routinely opened the door. The findings show that the act of helping others depends on emotional reactions, which are dampened by the anti-anxiety medication. See Also: Social anxiety is highly heritable but is affected by environment ""The rats help each other because they care,"" said Peggy Mason, PhD, professor of neurobiology at the University of Chicago. ""They need to share the affect of the trapped rat in order to help, and that's a fundamental finding that tells us something about how we operate, because we're mammals like rats too."" The experiments utilize a rat-helping test originally established in a 2011 study published in Science by Mason, Inbal Ben-Ami Bartal, PhD, a post-doctoral scholar now at the University of California, Berkeley, and Jean Decety, PhD, Irving B. Harris Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Chicago. In those early experiments, the team placed two rats that normally shared a cage into a special test arena. One rat was held in a restrainer--a closed tube with a door that can be nudged open only from the outside. The second rat roamed free in the cage around the restrainer, able to see and hear the trapped cage mate. Rats given midazolam did not free trapped cage mates. Credit: University of Chicago Medicine  In the previous study, the free rats quickly learned to release their trapped cage mates, seen as a sign of empathy for their companions in distress. In the latest research, rats injected with midazolam did not free a companion rat trapped inside a restrainer. Yet rats injected with midazolam did open the same restrainer when that restrainer contained chocolate chips. Stress, like what happens after seeing and hearing a trapped companion, triggers the adrenal gland and sympathetic nervous system and causes physical symptoms such as increased heart rate and high blood pressure. To test if the rats' helping behavior was driven by these physical changes, Mason and her team conducted a separate series of experiments by giving the rats nadolol, a beta-blocker similar to those used to treat high blood pressure. Nadolol prevents the pounding heart and other bodily signs of a stress response. Rats given nadolol were just as likely to help their companions as those injected with saline or nothing at all. Learn More: Empathy more common in animals than thought""What that tells you is that they don't have to be physiologically, peripherally aroused in order to help. They just have to care inside their brain,"" Mason said. Mason's team also created a statistical model to find out if helping other rats was a rewarding, behavior for the animals that became reinforced over time, or if they simply became more comfortable with the testing environment and improved their ability to open the restrainer. Using data collected from the rats' behavior during the experiments, Haozhe Shan, an undergraduate student at UChicago, calculated the probability that each rat would free a companion in each testing session. He then projected these probabilities over 10,000 simulated attempts while keeping each trial independent, meaning that if a rat opened the restraint one day it was no more likely to open on the next day. When Shan compared the simulated data to those from the experiments, he saw that the untreated rats performed better than the simulations predicted. If they freed a companion one day, the probability that they would do so again the next day increased, meaning the behavior was being reinforced. Meanwhile, rats given midazolam were no more likely to free a companion one day to the next, even if they did so on a previous day. ""We take that as a sign that the rats given midazolam don't find the outcome rewarding, presumably because they didn't find it a troubling situation in the first place,"" Shan said. Mason and her team also tested levels of corticosterone, a stress hormone, in the rats when first exposed to the trapped cage mate and compared them to their later behavior. Those with low- to mid-level responses were most likely to free their companions later. They found that those with the highest levels of corticosterone, or those that were under the most stress from the situation, were the least likely to help their cage mates. This fits well with findings in humans suggesting that eventually high stress becomes immobilizing rather than motivating. Don't Miss: Training brain patterns of empathy using functional brain imaging Mason said that this research further confirms the previous research that rats, and by extension other mammals--including humans--are motivated by empathy and find the act of helping others gratifying. ""Helping others could be your new drug. Go help some people and you'll feel really good,"" she said. ""I think that's a mammalian trait that has developed through evolution. Helping another is good for the species."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source.

At least this is indicated by the results of a current study that was conducted at the University of Bonn. In it the participants were able to purchase pieces of music but could themselves set the price to be paid. During the process, the researchers recorded the brain activity of the participants. The work appears in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. See Also: Hippocampal activity during music listening exposes the memory-boosting power of music In 2007 the band Radiohead made music history with an unusual step: They put their new album on the Internet for downloading - without asking for a set price. Instead, the fan themselves were able to decide how much they were willing to pay. In an economic respect, this experiment was at least a partial success: Some music fans succumbed to the temptation to download the songs without paying. Others paid voluntarily for the album - some up to 20 dollars, which is twice as much as it would normally have cost. Thus, in such ""pay what you want"" offerings, it seems to be not only economic interests that play a role but also social considerations, such as fairness. However, what happens in the brain in such situations remained unknown until now. The pilot study just published provides an initial answer to this question. The participating scientists at the University of Bonn and the University of Ulm invited a total of 25 participants to an experiment in a brain scanner. The subjects first listened to a 30-second clip from a piece of music. They were then to decide whether they wanted to buy the associated album or not. Don't Miss: Move over Mozart: Study shows cats prefer their own beat In some cases the test persons were free to decide how much they wanted to pay for the album. Under this ""pay-what-you-want"" condition, they were able to keep the songs regardless of the amount paid, no matter what. In other cases, the scientists had set a fixed price, they amount of which was unknown to the participants. The participants could also suggest a monetary amount but did not know that they could only get the album, if their suggestion was over the price set. During the process the researchers recorded brain activity. ""In the fixed price scenario, we found activation patterns that met our expectations exactly"", explains Dr. Sebastian Markett of the Department of Differential and Biological Psychology: ""As soon as they listened to the music clip, the participants showed activity in certain brain structures that are part of the so-called reward system. The better they liked the piece, the stronger the activation - and the higher then the amount they bid for the album"". In this case, therefore, the music enjoyment dictated the bid. It was quite different, when, after listening to the piece, the participants heard that they could determine the price themselves. In these cases, the strength of activation did not permit a direct conclusion about the amount that the participants would later pay. Instead, in them, a region of the brain became highly activated that had been completely unremarkable under the fixed price conditions: the so-called lingual gyrus. ""We combed through databases for studies in which the lingual gyrus was also activated and statistically analysed the hits - actually several hundred"", explains the lead author of the study, Simon Waskow. ""According to them, this is an area that reacts very early to visual stimuli that have a social component"". For example, the lingual gyrus sounds the alarm, when we discover an expression of rejection in a face. Learn More: Engineering music to sound better with cochlear implants ""When our participants read that they themselves could choose the price for the piece just heard, their lingual gyrus became active"", says Waskow. ""This activation may have caused their brain to switch to another mode: Now, in making the decision, no longer just economic and emotional considerations but also social considerations, such as the fairness concept, were considered"". This explanation is still just a hypothesis. However, the scientists hope to firm up their conclusions in further studies with more test participants.

The finding provides evidence that learning ability is influenced by functional diversity of a single gene in a single neuron. See Also: NIH-funded study reveals how differences in male and female brains emerge in C. elegans C. elegans, a tiny roundworm that lives in soil, can remember concentrations of salts (NaCl etc.) to which it has been exposed during feeding or food deprivation and learn to approach or avoid those salt concentrations. The research group previously found that an insulin receptor, which is known to regulate blood glucose levels in humans, acts in a gustatory neuron that senses external salt concentrations in this learned behavior. While the insulin receptor is encoded by a single gene in C. elegans, multiple types of insulin receptor are produced by switching RNA processing patterns. It was reported that a specific type of the insulin receptors, called DAF-2c, is required for the learned behavior in C. elegans. However, the detailed mechanism and the cell type that produces DAF-2c remained unclear. Here, the research group of Assistant Professor Masahiro Tomioka and Professor Yuichi Iino at the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Science found that DAF-2c was produced only in a restricted subset of neurons, including the gustatory neuron. C. elegans has a compact nervous system, which consists of only 302 neurons, and the individual neurons play indispensable roles in behavioral and physiological functions. The research group unveiled the molecular mechanism by which the RNA processing pattern was switched and, as a result, DAF-2c was produced only in the restricted group of neurons. They further demonstrated that this mechanism underlies the learned salt avoidance under starvation conditions.

This diversity is fascinating in its own right and at the same time has great import for agriculture.  Maize is one of the world s top-three staple foods; along with rice and wheat it accounts for two-thirds of world food consumption. Ware was part of a large multinational team that in 2009 assembled the first-ever sequence of maize s 30,000 or so genes, based on a single variety called B73. The discovery of maize s extraordinary protein diversity is based on more accurate  long-read  sequencing technology, provided through a research partnership with PacBio, a sequencing company. This updated technology did not reveal very many previously unknown genes, but rather, many more of the RNA messages that are generated when genes are expressed, i.e., activated. In all, 111,151 RNA transcripts from genes being expressed in six different maize tissues were read and analyzed in the research. About 57% of these messages had never been seen   and therefore had never been sequenced.  These were the messages that told us that our efforts to annotate and characterize the 2009 maize reference genome have been far from complete,  says Bo Wang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral investigator in Ware s lab and first author of the paper reporting the new research. What makes one maize plant potentially much different from any other, even individuals of the same variety, is the way its genes are capable of being expressed, depending on conditions both internal to the plant and in the surrounding environment, e.g., levels of soil moisture, nutrients, or available light. Many of maize s total complement of 30,000-odd genes can generate RNA messages that can be spliced, i.e., edited, in different ways, leading to the production of different proteins   proteins with different shapes and different functions. Alternative RNA splicing is a phenomenon that occurs in nearly all forms of multicellular life, including humans. The current work begins to suggest how extensively alternative splicing, and therefore alternative developmental possibilities, are available to each maize individual   a surprise, indeed, for anyone who thought the 2009 genome annotation captured the essence of the species. The practical import of the research is that  it begins to reveal new functional parts that we didn t know about before,  says Ware.  By having insight into what those other parts are and what they do, we begin to realize new ways of breeding corn, adapting it, for example, to changes in climate as average annual temperatures in growing zones continue to climb.

Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a fix that allows RNA to accurately proofread for the first time. The new discovery, published June 23 in the journal Science, will increase precision in genetic research and could dramatically improve medicine based on a person s genetic makeup. Certain viruses called retroviruses can cause RNA to make copies of DNA, a process called reverse transcription. This process is notoriously prone to errors because an evolutionary ancestor of all viruses never had the ability to accurately copy genetic material. The new innovation engineered at UT Austin is an enzyme that performs reverse transcription but can also  proofread,  or check its work while copying genetic code. The enzyme allows, for the first time, for large amounts of RNA information to be copied with near perfect accuracy.  We created a new group of enzymes that can read the genetic information inside living cells with unprecedented accuracy,  says Jared Ellefson, a postdoctoral fellow in UT Austin s Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology.  Overlooked by evolution, our enzyme can correct errors while copying RNA.  Reverse transcription is mainly associated with retroviruses such as HIV. In nature, these viruses  inability to copy DNA accurately may have helped create variety in species over time, contributing to the complexity of life as we know it. Since discovering reverse transcription, scientists have used it to better understand genetic information related to inheritable diseases and other aspects of human health. Still, the error-prone nature of existing RNA sequencing is a problem for scientists.  With proofreading, our new enzyme increases precision and fidelity of RNA sequencing,  says Ellefson.  Without the ability to faithfully read RNA, we cannot accurately determine the inner workings of cells. These errors can lead to misleading data in the research lab and potential misdiagnosis in the clinical lab.  Ellefson and the team of researchers engineered the new enzyme using directed evolution to train a high-fidelity (proofreading) DNA polymerase to use RNA templates. The new enzyme, called RTX, retains the highly accurate and efficient proofreading function, while copying RNA. Accuracy is improved at least threefold, and it may be up to 10 times as accurate. This new enzyme could enhance the methods used to read RNA from cells.  As we move towards an age of personalized medicine where everyone s transcripts will be read out almost as easily as taking a pulse, the accuracy of the sequence information will become increasingly important,  says Andy Ellington, a professor of molecular biosciences.  The significance of this is that we can now also copy large amounts of RNA information found in modern genomes, in the form of the RNA transcripts that encode almost every aspect of our physiology. This means that diagnoses made based on genomic information are far more likely to be accurate.  In addition to Ellefson and Ellington, authors include Jimmy Gollihar, Raghav Shroff, Haridha Shivram and Vishwanath Iyer. All are affiliated with the Department of Molecular Biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin. This research was supported by grants from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellows, NASA and the Welch Foundation. A provisional patent was filed on the new sequence of the enzyme.","Published: June 27, 2016"

It is often not the original tumour that kills, but secondary growths. These happen when cancer cells are able to break away from the primary site, travel around the body and  seed  new tumours. A key question in cancer research has been how cancer cells are able to survive once they break away from a tumour to spread around the body. Cells are relatively protected when they are attached to other cancer cells and their surroundings, but become more vulnerable when they detach and  float , and normally undergo cell death.   Lead researcher Dr St phanie Kermorgant from QMUL s Barts Cancer Institute said:  Metastasis is currently incurable and remains one of the key targets of cancer research. Our research advances the knowledge of how two key molecules communicate and work together to help cancer cells survive during metastasis. We re hoping that this might lead to the discovery of new drugs to block the spread of cancer within the body.  The study, published in Nature Communications, examined the changes that occur in cancer cells as they break away from tumours in cell cultures, zebrafish and mice. The researchers revealed a previously unknown survival mechanism in cancer cells and found that molecules known as  integrins  could be key. Integrins are proteins on the cell surface that attach to and interact with the cell s surroundings.  Outside-in  and  inside-out  signalling by integrins is known to help the cancer cells attach themselves to their surroundings. But the study suggests that when the cancer cells are floating, as they do during metastasis, the integrins switch from their adhesion role to take on an entirely new form of communication which has never been seen before    inside-in  signalling, in which integrins signal within the cell. The researchers discovered that an integrin called beta-1 ( 1) pairs up with another protein called c-Met and they move inside the cell together. The two proteins then travel to an unexpected location within the cell which is normally used to degrade and recycle cell material. Instead the location is used for a new role of cell communication and the two proteins send a message to the rest of the cell to resist against death while floating during metastasis. Using both breast and lung cells, the team found that metastases were less likely to form when  1 and c-Met were blocked from entering the cell together or were prevented from moving to the special location within the cell. Integrins are already major targets for cancer treatment with drugs either being tested or in use in the clinic. Most integrin inhibitor drugs target their adhesive function and block them on the surface of the cancer cell. The researchers say that the limited success of these drugs could be partly explained by this newly discovered role of integrins within the cancer cell. A new strategy could be to prevent the integrin from going inside the cell in the first place. The researchers hope that these insights could lead to the design of better therapies against metastasis and more effective treatment combinations that could prevent and slow both tumour growth and spread. The research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council, Breast Cancer Now, Rosetrees Trust, British Lung Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Barts Charity. Baroness Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now, said:  This promising early research identifies a potential new way that cancer cells are able to survive once they have broken free of their primary tumour in the breast.  Once breast cancer spreads it can be controlled for a while but sadly it cannot be cured. It s the main reason that around 11,500 women in the UK still lose their lives to this dreadful disease each year and we urgently need to improve our understanding of how breast cancer cells are able migrate across the body.  This discovery opens new doors for scientists to try to stop breast cancer spreading and to ultimately save lives, and we look forward to future developments in this exciting area of research.  Dr Susie Gray, Research and Communications Officer at Rosetrees Trust said:  Rosetrees Trust is delighted to support Dr Kermorgant s work. We hope that our support of this exciting research will one day lead to better treatments that can prevent the spread of cancer.  The team carried out part of their animal research work on zebrafish embryos in order to implement the principle of 3Rs (refine, reduce, replace) on their research on mice. Zebrafish provide a similar tumour microenvironment to humans, meaning fewer tests need to be carried out in mice and any future experiments in mice will have been optimised to have minimal toxicity. They are aiming to reduce the number of mice used by at least 90 per cent and ultimately use zebrafish to completely replace the use of mice.","Published: June 27, 2016"

Savolitinib has the potential to address major unmet medical needs in c-Met-driven subsets of NSCLC, a disease that is estimated to afflict approximately 1.7 million new patients annually worldwide. The trial is a single-arm global Phase II study of savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso (osimertinib/AZD9291) in advanced NSCLC patients who have developed resistance to approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ). This expansion was initiated following encouraging early data from a number of patients enrolled in the TATTON study who received savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso. The initiation of the expanded Phase II study has triggered a US$10 million milestone payment to Hutchison MediPharma Limited ( HMP ) (a 99.8% held subsidiary of Chi-Med) under the terms of the agreement with AstraZeneca PLC ( AstraZeneca ) signed in December 2011. HMP and AstraZeneca are conducting Phase II studies in NSCLC with savolitinib in monotherapy, as well as in combination with either Tagrisso or Iressa (gefitinib). AstraZeneca continues to lead and invest in the global NSCLC development program for savolitinib. Susan Galbraith, Senior Vice President, Head of Oncology Innovative Medicines, AstraZeneca, said:  Savolitinib is a highly selective c-Met inhibitor that is being investigated in a number of cancers including in patients with lung cancer whose disease is driven by aberrant c-Met / HGF signaling. We are extremely excited by the data we have seen for savolitinib when used in combination with our EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We are committed to advancing research to develop a broad range of potential treatment options for patients with lung cancer.  Christian Hogg, Chief Executive Officer of Chi-Med, said:  We estimate that the annual incidence of patients with MET-driven NSCLC in the U.S., European Union and Japan totals about 40,000-50,000 in all treatment settings. This is an important unmet medical need and one that we believe savolitinib is well suited to address because of its very high selectivity. This allows for effective target coverage of c-Met, as well as safe and tolerable combinations with other oncology agents. We believe that savolitinib either as a monotherapy in first-line NSCLC, or in proprietary combinations with AstraZeneca s Iressa and Tagrisso in second- and third-line NSCLC, will address the key genetic drivers of cancer cell proliferation in these very difficult-to-treat NSCLC patients. We are hopeful about proceeding into Phase III in 2017 based on future data from this study.  NSCLC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS Savolitinib continues to be explored in a range of MET-driven NSCLC settings including: Savolitinib in combination with Tagrisso or Iressa in Phase II expansions of ongoing studies in advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC Savolitinib + Tagrisso combination Phase II study in third-line NSCLC (for patients progressing on T790M-directed therapies) Savolitinib monotherapy Phase II study in NSCLC Savolitinib is in clinical development in multiple MET-driven solid tumor indications including NSCLC, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancer.","Published: June 25, 2016"

Variations in the number of DNA sequence repeats are known to exist between individuals. Some of these copy number variations (CNVs) are associated with disease, as with schizophrenia, wherein rare CNVs on chromosomes, including 1, 15, 16, and 22, are more common among patients than among controls. However, previous studies have not fully investigated the effect of particular CNVs, especially those on the X chromosome, on patient characteristics. Nor have they examined the genes responsible for CNVs in schizophrenia, which would aid understanding of disease development. See Also: Schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk deconstructedThe researchers used a technique based on DNA fragments labeled with different fluorescent markers to reveal high levels of genetic heterogeneity (whereby several different genetic defects can cause the same symptoms) in schizophrenia. They also observed that the CNVs associated with schizophrenia affected gene categories controlling repair of DNA damage, which may underlie disease mechanisms. The study is published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. The technique the researchers used was more sensitive and of a higher resolution than previous methods. This allowed detection of more CNVs, especially small ones, which accounted for 70 percent of all CNVs. Significantly more clinically important CNVs were seen in the DNA of 1,699 patients with schizophrenia than in the 824 control individuals, while abnormal numbers of X chromosomes were also associated with disease. High genetic heterogeneity was revealed by the detection of these CNVs at 67 different regions in 9 percent of patients. Further variation was observed in the effect of the CNVs on patient characteristics in that some CNVs were carried by controls without causing any symptoms. ""Patients with clinically important CNVs showed a range of characteristics, such as developmental problems and refusal to accept treatment,"" first author Itaru Kushima says. ""And, the presence of two CNVs resulted in a more severe phenotype."" Don't Miss: Researchers identify signature of microbiomes associated with schizophrenia The researchers looked closely at the genetic regions containing CNVs to identify several gene categories associated with schizophrenia that may be affected by genetic disturbance. These include oxidative stress response, which leads to DNA damage when imbalanced, and genomic integrity, involving DNA repair and replication.

The research lays the groundwork for ""mapping"" the gene activity in the human brain and could help provide a better understanding of brain functions and disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia and depression. See Also: Discovery puts designer dopamine neurons within reach By isolating and analyzing the nuclei of individual human brain cells, researchers identified 16 neuronal subtypes in the cerebral cortex the brain's outer layer of neural tissue responsible for cognitive functions including memory, attention and decision making. The team, led by researchers at the University of California (UC) San Diego, The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Illumina, published their findings online in the journal Science. ""We're providing a unified framework to look at and compare individual neurons, which can help us find out how many unique types of neurons exist,"" said Kun Zhang, bioengineering professor at the University of California, San Diego and a corresponding author of the study. Researchers can use these different neuronal subtypes to build what Zhang calls a ""reference map"" of the human brain a foundation to understand the differences between a healthy brain and a diseased brain. ""In the future, patients with brain disorders or abnormalities could be diagnosed and treated based on how they differ from the reference map. This is analogous to what's being done with the reference human genome map,"" Zhang said. The new study reflects a growing understanding that individual brain cells are unique: they express different types of genes and perform different functions. To better understand this diversity, researchers analyzed more than 3,200 single human neurons in six Brodmann areas, which are regions of the cerebral cortex classified by their functions and arrangements of neurons. Through an interdisciplinary collaborative effort, the team developed a new method to isolate and sequence individual cell nuclei. TSRI researchers led by neuroscience professor Jerold Chun obtained the samples from a post mortem brain and focused on isolating the neuronal nuclei. Zhang's lab worked with Fluidigm, a manufacturer of microfluidic chips for single-cell studies, to develop a protocol to identify and quantify RNA molecules in individual neuronal nuclei. Scientists at San Diego-based Illumina sequenced the resulting RNA libraries. Researchers led by biochemistry professor Wei Wang at UC San Diego developed algorithms to cluster and identify 16 neuronal subtypes from the sequenced datasets. Researchers deciphered what types of genes were ""turned on"" within each nucleus and revealed that various combinations of the 16 subtypes tended to cluster in cortical layers and Brodmann areas, helping explain why these regions look and function differently.

On the surface of our numerous astrocytes (our star-shaped brain cells), they have found the molecule LRP4 is important in ensuring healthy levels of a neurotransmitter that enables learning and memory, said Dr. Lin Mei, chairman of the Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) at Augusta University and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Neuroscience. See Also: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning This neurotransmitter is glutamate, the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. It was known that astrocytes could regulate or modulate brain cell communication by adjusting levels of glutamate. But now, the MCG scientists have shown that LRP4 is in those astrocytes, and that without it, glutamate release is dramatically reduced. Mice are intellectually impaired and have difficulty with movement, Mei said of the findings he characterizes as ""unexpected."" One benefit was protection from seizures because of the reduced excitability of neurons. Removing LRP4 from nearby neurons did not yield the same negative effects. While much work remains, Mei and his colleagues believe the work published in Nature Neuroscience provides new insight into the critical regulation of neurotransmitters that enable neurons to take action as well as potential therapeutic targets for one day helping individuals with intellectual disabilities. Once made, glutamate gets passed from one neuron to the next via synapses and dysfunction of synapses is associated with a host of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, addiction, schizophrenia and autism. Taking LRP4 out of the equation messes up the delicate balance, the scientists have found. Without it, levels of ATP, a natural energy source for cells that also inhibits glutamate release, also dramatically increase. In fact, regulating ATP levels is one way astrocytes help regulate the level of neurotransmitters, Mei said. But in this scenario, too much ATP translates to too little glutamate. Blocking the receptor ATP eventually activates ameliorates the negative impact that high levels had on the mice. ""When you take LRP4 out of astrocytes, ATP levels released by those astrocytes go super high, which suppresses glutamate transmission,"" Mei said. Learn More: Brains with autism adapt differently during implicit learning Astrocytes, the most common type of glial cell in our brains, account for about half of all the cells in the brain. While the brain actually has more glial cells than neurons, glial cells were long thought to provide only structural support to the neurons, much like cement supports a house. ""That view has been changed and is changing,"" said Mei. Now it's clear that glial cells, like astrocytes, have a role in neurodevelopment and longer-term in regulating communication between two neurons. In the neuromuscular juncture, Mei's lab found several years back that LRP4 on the muscle cell surface is a receptor for agrin, a protein that motor neurons release to direct construction of the nerve-muscle juncture. His lab later identified antibodies to LRP4 and agrin as new causes of myasthenia gravis. The new research indicates that release of ATP by astrocytes is also regulated by agrin signaling.

The study could help lead to new drug targets in pain management. The research, published in the journal Cell Reports, was led by W. Daniel Tracey Jr., a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Linda and Jack Gill Center for Biomolecular Science and the Department of Biology. ""Our study is the first to thoroughly assess the function of a large set of genes expressed at high levels in nociceptive neurons, the nerves responsible for the sensation of pain in humans,"" Tracey said. ""It represents a significant step forward in the field of nociception and pain research."" See Also: New molecular mechanism of neuropathic pain in mice First author on the paper is Ken Honjo of the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Honjo conducted work on the project as a member of Tracey's lab at Duke University, where Tracey was previously on faculty. Also an author is Stephanie E. Mauthner, an assistant scientist at IU Bloomington. A total of 36 genes were identified as having a role in either hypersensitivity or lack of sensation to stimuli, 20 of which are found in both humans and fruit flies, or Drosophila. Approximately 70 percent of genes in humans are also found in flies, originating in a common ancestor. The 36 ""genes of interest"" in the study were screened from a total of 275 genes previously identified by Tracey's lab to express at higher-than-average levels in nociceptors, the nerves that send signals to the brain in response to strong external stimuli. The human brain can interpret signals from these nerves as pain. In flies, they may be triggered by mechanical stimuli or high heat. Of the 36 genes under investigation, 22 genes were found to play a role in hypersensitivity to heat; 14 were found to play a role in insensitivity. ""This first group appears to activate a function that inhibits the nociceptors,"" Tracey said. ""These are interesting because you can imagine that if you could make a drug that was able to activate an inhibitor, then you could block pain."" Although nociceptors can trigger pain sensation based on sensory input, Tracey said the nerves can also play a role in other forms of pain not triggered by external stimulation, including chronic or neuropathic pain, estimated to affect 1.5 billion people and up to 4.5 percent of the global population, respectively, according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine. As the first researchers to ascribe a function to the majority of these genes, Tracey's team had the right to name them. The genes implicated in heat hypersensitivity were named after objects that burn at high temperatures, including ""black match,"" ""eucalyptus,"" ""firelighter,"" ""primacord"" (a detonating cord used in explosives), ""jet fuel,"" ""detonator,"" ""gasoline,"" ""smoke alarm"" and ""jetboil"" (a campsite cooking system). Genes implicated in heat-resistance were similarly named. They included ""boilerman,"" ""bunker gear,"" ""fire dancer,"" ""oven mitt,"" ""trivet"" and ""thawb"" (a traditional, ankle-length garment worn in the desert). To identify these genes, Tracey's team bred multiple strains of fruit flies, each with one of the 275 genes under investigation suppressed through RNA interference in which RNA molecules are used to inhibit the expression of a specific gene. The flies were then exposed to two temperatures 42 and 46 degrees Celsius as larvae, which normally react to the higher of these temperatures by rolling slowly. If they rolled more quickly at 42 degrees, it indicated hypersensitivity. If they did not roll at 46 degrees, it indicated insensitivity. Learn More: A new approach to treat asthma: Silencing nociceptor neurons in the lungs Moreover, Tracey said nine of the genes related to insensitivity caused the flies to grow a lower-than-average number of the nerve branches (dendrites), connecting nociceptors to the surface of the body. Two of the genes related to hypersensitivity, including ""smoke alarm,"" caused the flies to grow extra dendrites. The specific reason for this branching behavior is one of the new questions posed by this research. More broadly, Tracey aims to conduct further studies that examine the exact chemical pathways these genes activate in nerve cells in order to understand precisely why they result in changes in sensitivity.

Rehman and his colleagues focused on the role of glutamine in stem cells, because the amino acid is known to serve as a major source of carbon used to make cellular building blocks in cancer cells, which, like stem cells, also grow very rapidly. They traced the path of glutamine in human embryonic stem cells and found that it wound up in the cells  mitochondria.  People often assume that mitochondria are just the cellular energy generators. But they also serve as factories for producing important molecules cells need to grow,  Rehman said. Glutamine is metabolized at a very high rate in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells. The researchers observed that glutamine metabolism drops dramatically as the cells differentiate into various mature cell types, such as the endothelial cells that form the lining of blood vessels.  We wanted to take a closer look at the molecular program linking the decrease in glutamine metabolism to stem cell differentiation,  said Rehman, who is an associate professor of medicine and pharmacology at UIC. When the researchers selectively withheld glutamine from human embryonic stem cells growing in the lab, they noticed that levels of an important regulatory molecule called OCT4 decreased significantly, and the cells began to differentiate. OCT4 is a transcription factor that activates genes that maintain the cell in a state of pluripotency and silence the genes and prevent differentiation and maturation of the stem cells. Glutamine withdrawal was also accompanied by a rise in reactive oxygen species within the cells, which can damage cellular structures if levels are too high. It turns out that OCT4 is especially vulnerable to degradation by reactive oxygen species. As glutamine metabolism drops, and levels of reactive oxygen species rise, OCT4 breaks down and is no longer able to hold the cell in a pluripotent state. The cell then starts to express the genes that allow it to mature into a specific type of cell.  Glutamine keeps OCT4  on,  and when you starve the cells of glutamine, you dial down that OCT4 switch so that the cells can then mature,  Rehman said.  It is also important to note that reactive oxygen species served as a signal which allowed stem cells to differentiate. Certain levels of oxidants or reactive oxygen species may be necessary for the maturation of stem cells.  The finding suggests a technique that may prove useful for tissue engineering, said first author Glenn Marsboom, research assistant professor of pharmacology at UIC.  When researchers want to produce mature cells from stem cells, they traditionally use a cocktail of growth factors and other chemicals known to produce the specific cell type they want,  Marsboom, said.  We wanted to see what would happen if we added glutamine withdrawal to the differentiation-cocktail we use for producing endothelial cells from human embryonic stem cells.  They found that by also withdrawing glutamine, twice as many endothelial cells were produced, compared to the use of growth factors alone. And the mature cells were of a higher quality. The glutamine-starved endothelial cells were better able to organize into blood vessels in a 3-dimensional scaffold.  These endothelial cells migrated into place more successfully to form the tubes that make up vascular networks,  said Rehman, which may improve the engineering of functional blood vessels from human embryonic stem cells. More broadly, he said, the finding highlights the importance of metabolic cues in regenerative therapies.  To successfully engineer new blood vessels or tissues for diseased patients, we need to help stem cells adapt to the metabolic environment and demands of the mature organs.

The study, published in the June 22, 2016, issue of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, is the first to reveal how common the genetic cause of Huntington s disease is in the general population. Huntington s disease is an inherited condition typically diagnosed in adult life. It causes involuntary movements and psychiatric problems. The symptoms of the disease become evident years after specific brain cells start to die. The symptoms of Huntington disease steadily worsen and lead to death 15-20 years later. The gene which causes Huntington s disease, HTT, was discovered in 1993. It contains a section where three letters of the DNA code are repeated. Most people have up to 27 repeats in the gene. People with more than 40 repeats develop the disease, as do some of those with 37 to 39 repeats. But until now it has remained unclear how many people in the general population have the additional repeat mutation that causes Huntington s disease, and how many of them are at risk of developing it.  It has been a difficult question to answer, since no one has ever examined the gene repeats in large numbers of people outside the clinic,  says Chris Kay from the University of British Columbia, lead author on the manuscript.  We had estimates based on how many patients we see, but our study in Canada, United States of America and Scotland found far more mutations than expected.  The majority of these had between 37 and 39 repeats, which usually results in Huntington s disease starting over the age of 60. The new results suggest that many people with the mutation may never actually develop the disease.  We have known for many years that older Huntington s disease patients tend to have smaller numbers of repeats,  says Dr. Michael R. Hayden, from the University of British Columbia, who directed the study.  But the high frequency of these mutations in the general public shows that we may be underestimating the number of elderly patients with Huntington s disease. Their symptoms may not be clearly recognized as Huntington s disease. Likewise, it may be that only some of these people will ever go on to develop Huntington s disease, and that others are protected in some way.  The study opens new questions regarding the true number of people who manifest Huntington disease, and whether people who live longer have a higher risk of developing symptoms.  As more and more people are tested for genetic conditions, it is increasingly important for healthcare workers to accurately explain what such gene variations do and don t mean,  says Professor Zosia Miedzybrodzka, a co-author on the study at the University of Aberdeen.  We don t want people who will never get the condition having a gene test for another reason being worried about it in error or disadvantaged in some way. On the other hand, recognising the disease in more people who actually have problems from it should improve their medical care.  The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research with the assistance of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and the NHS Grampian Huntington s disease endowments research fund.","Published: June 24, 2016"

The Food Allergy Science Initiative (FASI), which will be centered at the Broad, will tap the combined resources of participating academic and research institutions to help answer key scientific questions surrounding food allergies, the causes of which remain little-understood.  We are bringing together scientists from several disciplines to tackle head on the underlying biology of food allergy,  says Ruslan Medzhitov, who will lead the initiative. Medzhitov is the David W. Wallace Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine and an investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  We believe that the combined scale of our approach will help to transform this field and open up new avenues for treatment and prevention.  Eight percent of American children suffer from debilitating food allergies, and much remains unknown about the root causes of the condition. Genetics, gut microbes, the immune system, and food-derived allergens and the interactions between these factors somehow lead to the breakdown in tolerance that drives food allergy, but we understand little about what leads to food allergy, how to prevent it, and how to resolve it once it arises. However, with the dramatic advances in genomic technologies, immunology, and microbiome research in the past decade, scientists are now in a unique position to explore the biological mechanisms behind food allergies. Among the cutting-edge technologies the Broad will bring to bear on food allergy research are single-cell genomic analysis which will reveal new information about the cell populations involved in the allergic response and CRISPR genome-editing techniques, which will enable large-scale screens to test the role individual genes play in food allergy.  There has been an urgent call for answers within the food allergy advocacy community, and a lot of great work is already underway,  says Aviv Regev, a core institute member of the Broad, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and part of FASI s scientific leadership.  However, we know too little about the basic biological mechanisms that underlie these allergies. We believe that with an ambitious, interdisciplinary approach, and a partnership between immunologists, clinicians, technologists, and computational scientists we can help speed research and enhance scientific understanding of food allergy in a manner that would translate in the future to improved diagnostics and therapies.  The newly-founded initiative currently involve researchers from Yale School of Medicine, Brigham and Women s Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and MIT, in addition to the Broad. Along with Medzhitov and Regev, FASI s scientific leadership includes Vijay Kuchroo (Broad, HMS, BWH); J. Christopher Love (Broad, MIT); Wayne Shreffler (MGH, HMS); and Ramnik Xavier (Broad, MGH, MIT, HMS). They enter a near-barren landscape in terms of our understanding of the fundamental biological mechanisms underlying food allergy. Currently, diagnosing and treating food allergy is a major challenge: allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening, are the primary means of diagnosis, and treatment is limited to avoidance of known allergy-causing foods and epinephrine injections, which are only administered once an allergic reaction has been triggered. Understanding the basic biology that drives the allergic response to food is a first step needed to catalyze research. FASI aims to accelerate the pace of discovery in this field and enable the development of new diagnostics and treatments through a coordinated effort that brings together specialists from a variety of disciplines including immunology, gastroenterology, computational biology, molecular biology, and bioengineering to answer fundamental questions pertaining to food allergy.

Penn will receive an estimated $4.5 million from the grant. The Center is led by Gerard D. Schellenberg, PhD, a professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Li-San Wang, PhD, an associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, in partnership with investigators from five other sites  -- Boston University, Case Western Reserve University, Columbia University, the University of Miami, and the University of Indiana.  By coordinating the identification of Alzheimer s-related genes, the Center s team aims to find new therapeutic targets to reduce the economic and human burden caused by this disease,  Schellenberg said.  This is an exciting opportunity to apply new technologies to improve our understanding of the biological pathways underlying this devastating disease. The new center will stimulate collaborations between hundreds of U.S. and international Alzheimer s genetics researchers by aggregating and analyzing very large data sets and sharing the results. This type of global interaction is needed if we are to make progress in solving this devastating illness.  Alzheimer s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, has become an epidemic that currently affects as many as five million people age 65 and older in the United States, with economic costs that are comparable to, if not greater than, caring for those of heart disease or cancer. Available drugs only marginally affect disease severity and progression. While there is no way to prevent this disease, the discovery of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer s is bringing researchers closer to learning how the genes work together and may help identify the most effective interventions.  The Genomics Center will be a state-of-the-art national clearinghouse for Alzheimer s genomics information based at Penn,  Wang said.  We have an important mission to move the field of Alzheimer s genetics forward by coordinating all NIA-funded activities for the Alzheimer s Disease Sequencing Project.  Center collaborators will collect and  harmonize  available AD genetics and associated physiological data into a common database to maximize statistical power to find therapeutic targets.  Data-sharing and collaboration among cutting-edge research teams is key to advancing our understanding of complex genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer s and related dementias,  said NIA director Richard Hodes, MD.  This new Center will play an important role in achieving our nation s ultimate research goal, outlined under the National Plan to Address Alzheimer s Disease to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer s disease by 2025.  The Genomics Center will also bring in data from other non-NIA-funded studies, reprocess into a consistent format, and add to the common database housed at the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS), the national genetics data repository for Alzheimer s disease developed and maintained by Wang s team since 2012 and the Data Coordinating Center for the ADSP. The Genomic Center will amass genomic sequence data from subjects with Alzheimer s disease and elderly cognitively normal subjects and use these data to identify genes that cause or protect against AD and other diseases.  As the amount of data acquired increases, this will be a valuable resource for the study of other genetic disorders at Penn and other institutions,  Wang said. The NIH Alzheimer s Disease Sequencing Program (ADSP), a collaboration that also began in 2012 between NIA and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), also part of NIH, has been analyzing data from 6,000 volunteers with Alzheimer s disease and 5,000 older cognitively normal, unaffected individuals. In addition, the teams will study genomic data from 111 large families with multiple Alzheimer s disease members, of Caucasian and Caribbean Hispanic descent to identify rare genetic variants.  For the next phase of the project, the new Center will analyze new sequence data from an additional 3,000 AD cases. In 2014, Schellenberg and Wang were also awarded NIA funds for the Consortium for Alzheimer s Sequence Analysis (CASA) to facilitate the analyses of the first stage of ADSP and additional non-ADSP sequence data to detect protective and risk gene variants for AD. CASA is a collaboration of Penn and Jonathan Haines, PhD at Case Western Reserve University; Richard Mayeux, MD, at Columbia University; Margaret Pericak-Vance, PhD, at the University of Miami; and Lindsay Farrer, PhD, at Boston University.","Published: June 24, 2016"

By identifying patients at either low or high risk of these events, physicians could more precisely tailor therapies, which can be costly or carry risks of their own, to each individual.  The traditional approach would say that these patients are all pretty high risk compared to healthy people, and that they should probably all be treated the same way,  said Peter Ganz, MD, professor of medicine at UCSF and chief of cardiology at the Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, a UCSF partner hospital.  But some new or emerging therapies are quite expensive, and others have significant side effects. We wanted to figure out if proteins in blood could predict cardiovascular risk in this population, and if so, whether a small number of these proteins could be used to mathematically construct a prediction model.  In the new research, published in the June 21, 2016 online issue of JAMA, the research team began by measuring levels of more than 1,000 different proteins in blood samples obtained as baseline measures in the UCSF-based  Heart and Soul  study, which has followed the cardiovascular health of study participants for as long as 11 years. The proteins were selected in an unbiased,  agnostic  manner, Ganz said, as the researchers were interested in their potential predictive power, irrespective of any biological role they might play in heart disease. The abundance of the proteins was measured using tools developed by SomaLogic, a Colorado company creating new methods of protein analysis for basic research, diagnosis, and therapy. SomaLogic s David G. Sterling, PhD, and Stephen A. Williams, MD, PhD, are co-authors of the new JAMA study. Each of the more than 900 Heart and Soul participants whose blood was analyzed in the new work had been diagnosed with  stable coronary heart disease a history of heart attack, occluded coronary arteries, bypass surgery, or related signs of cardiovascular disease. The baseline Heart and Soul blood samples were collected between 2000 and 2002, and the researchers employed a four-year  prediction horizon time,  meaning that they checked whether patients experienced adverse cardiovascular events in the four years following the donation of blood required for enrollment in the study. Ganz said the team was surprised to discover that about 200 of the original 1,000 proteins targeted had at least some predictive value. But because measuring such a large number of proteins is clinically impractical, the team used quality control procedures, as well as statistical methods suggested by co-author Mark R. Segal, PhD, professor of biostatistics and director of UCSF s Center for Bioinformatics and Molecular Biostatistics, to winnow that list down to just nine proteins. The model derived from this pared-down list proved more accurate at predicting cardiovascular events than the risk factors that are commonly considered in clinical practice.  Traditional risk factors blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes work pretty well in predicting outcomes in healthy people,  Ganz said,  but not in those who already have heart disease.  As noted, all the individuals whose blood was studied had the same diagnosis stable coronary heart disease but a  prognostic index  the researchers derived from measurements of the nine proteins revealed as much as a tenfold difference in their risk of adverse cardiovascular events: about 70 percent of those in the group predicted to be at highest risk suffered heart attacks, strokes, or other events, compared with only six percent of the lowest-risk group. To ensure these findings were valid, the team tested the nine-protein model using a separate set of nearly 1,000 blood samples obtained for a study called HUNT3, an initiative of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Even though those samples were collected using quite different procedures than those used in the Heart and Soul study, the nine-protein prediction model held up, with a similarly dramatic difference between high- and low-risk individuals. Though the nine-protein test cannot yet finely discriminate among all levels of risk between the highest and lowest levels, Ganz said that knowing which patients fall into these two extremes is clinically valuable in itself, especially as novel therapies for cardiovascular disease enter the marketplace from clinical trials. Recently approved, highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications known as PCSK9 inhibitors, for example, cost about $10,000 per year, and they must be given by regular injections, making them most suitable for patients at very high risk of cardiovascular events. Methotrexate, commonly used to tamp down inflammation in cancer and in rheumatoid arthritis, is now in clinical trials in low doses to treat heart disease. But because the drug exerts its effects by suppressing the immune system, it makes patients more susceptible to infections. A simple protein-based test could allow physicians to weigh this side effect against the benefit the treatment would bring to an individual patient. Ganz says the new study is the latest product of an unusually fruitful eight-year collaboration with SomaLogic, an academic-industry partnership that began after a chance encounter with a relative of the company s founders at the UCSF Department of Medicine s Grand Rounds. Joining Ganz, Segal, Sterling, and Williams in the research were Bettina Heidecker, MD, a former UCSF clinical fellow now at the University of Zurich; Kristian Hveem, MD, PhD, and Christian Jonasson, PhD, of NTNU; and Shintaro Kato of NEC Corporation of America. SomaLogic provided funding for protein analysis, and also provided payment to Segal for statistical analysis, and to Hveem and Jonasson for HUNT3 blood samples and database information. The Heart and Soul and HUNT3 studies are each supported by several government and foundation grants in the US and Norway, respectively.  Precision medicine is being able to tell an individual patient,  You are at very high risk, medium risk, or very low risk,  and that patient may opt to be treated differently from other patients with the same diagnosis,  Ganz said.

It can be a challenge to analyze and interpret the DNA profiles from these samples. Here we provide a new strategy to solve the problem by taking advantage of the intrinsic structural properties of DNA. We have assessed the in vivo positions of more than 35 million putative nucleosome cores in human leukocytes using high-throughput whole genome sequencing, and identified 2,462 single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 128 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels). After comparing the sequence reads with 44 STR loci commonly used in forensics, five STRs (TH01, TPOX, D18S51, DYS391, and D10S1248)were matched. We compared these ""nucleosome protected STRs"" (NPSTRs) with five other non-NPSTRs using mini-STR primer design, real-time PCR, and capillary gel electrophoresis on artificially degraded DNA. Moreover, genotyping performance of the five NPSTRs and five non-NPSTRs was also tested with real casework samples. All results show that loci located in nucleosomes are more likely to be successfully genotyped in degraded samples. In conclusion, after further strict validation, these markers could be incorporated into future forensic and paleontology identification kits, resulting in higher discriminatory power for certain degraded sample types.

Gender determination is an essential step in personal identification. Despite the advent of advanced techniques such as DNA fingerprinting, methods such as lip print and fingerprint analysis and mandibular canine index calculations are routinely used in gender determination, as they are simple and cost-effective. The present study investigated the hypothesis that lip print analysis is an effective tool in gender determination compared with fingerprint analysis and the mandibular canine index. The predominant patterns of lip prints and fingerprints were analyzed in males and females, and the efficacy of the mandibular canine index in gender determination was evaluated. The study group comprised 50 students, 25 males and 25 females who were 18-25 years of age. Lip prints and fingerprints were obtained and classified according to Tsuchihashi's classification and K cken and Newell's classification, respectively. Mandibular impressions were made and the mandibular canine index was calculated. Type I and Type I' lip prints were predominant in females, and Type IV lip prints were predominant in males. The analysis of fingerprints revealed that the loop fingerprint pattern was predominant in both males and females. The mandibular canine index was not found to be significant in gender identification. The predominant patterns of lip prints were distinct for males and females; conversely, fingerprints were demonstrated to be similar in both genders. Therefore, lip prints hold an increased potential for gender determination, as compared with fingerprints, and the mandibular canine index is not a reliable indicator of gender.

The study, which included scientists from Institut Pasteur in Paris and Mahidol University in Bangkok, suggests the Zika virus uses the body's own defences as a 'Trojan horse', allowing it to enter a human cell undetected. Once inside the cell, it replicates rapidly. Professor Gavin Screaton, senior author of the research and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial, said: ""Although this work is at a very early stage, it suggests previous exposure to dengue virus may enhance Zika infection. This may be why the current outbreak has been so severe, and why it has been in areas where dengue is prevalent. We now need further studies to confirm these findings, and to progress towards a vaccine.  A second study by the same team, published in Nature, suggests an antibody that works against the dengue virus may also neutralise Zika - providing a potential target for a vaccine. Dengue fever has risen dramatically over recent decades and the virus is thought to cause around 390 million infections each year   with 40 per cent of the world s population living in areas of risk. The dengue virus is similar to the Zika virus - they belong to the same viral family, called the Flaviviridae, and both are transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. In the new Nature Immunology paper, supported by the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council, the researchers used antibodies that recognise the dengue virus collected from individuals who had been infected with dengue. The team, who were also supported by the National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, added them to human cell cultures, together with the Zika virus. Their results suggest dengue antibodies can recognise and bind to Zika, due to the similarities between the viruses. Crucially, they also suggest that pre-existing dengue antibodies can amplify a Zika infection through a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This has been previously identified in dengue fever, and is thought to be why a second infection with dengue is often more serious than the first. When dengue first infects the body, the immune system makes antibodies against the virus. Antibodies are large proteins that latch onto invading bacteria or viruses, neutralising them and enabling the immune system to destroy the pathogens. The antibodies are then primed to recognise the same invaders should another attack occur. However, there are four different types of dengue virus. If someone is infected a second time by a different strain, the antibodies from the first attack can only partially bind to the virus, and are unable to prevent infection. The antibody, with the virus loosely attached, then shuttles into an immune cell. This immune cell would normally then kill the virus, but because the virus is not properly attached, it breaks free once it gains entry to the human immune cell. Here it hijacks the immune cell's machinery to replicate more viral particles, enhancing the infection. The new study suggests the same phenomenon occurs when a person who has previously been exposed to dengue encounters Zika. The existing dengue antibodies latch onto Zika, due to similarity between the viruses. However the antibodies are unable to latch onto Zika securely, and so the antibody simply facilitates entry of Zika into the human immune cells, where it replicates.  We now need to investigate whether the phenomenon of ADE may aid transfer of Zika across the placenta,  explained Dr Juthathip Mongkolsapaya, co-author from the Department of Medicine at Imperial. She added that the team also found that a type of antibody may help protect against the phenomenon of ADE, and prevent the virus from hijacking the immune cells. Previous work from the team has shown the immune system generates different types of antibodies to dengue that bind to various areas of the virus. In the current study, the team found a group of antibodies that bind to a certain site on the dengue virus   called EDE1 antibodies   were able to prevent the Zika virus from entering the immune cell. In a second study, published in Nature and co-authored by Professor Felix Rey from the Institut Pasteur and Professor Screaton from Imperial, the team confirmed that EDE1 antibodies bind efficiently to the Zika virus and potently neutralise infection. The team are now working hard to use these findings to develop new vaccines to dengue and Zika. Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: ""Zika and dengue come from the same family of viruses and we know they share many similarities in their genetic make-up, transmission pattern and in the immune response they trigger. These new studies suggest that prior infection with dengue doesn t offer any protection against Zika, and may in fact predispose people to a more severe infection. We can t say yet whether this interaction is playing a role in the current outbreak, but if confirmed it s likely to have important implications for the control and global spread of Zika, and for the development of any vaccine for the virus. There are still more questions than answers about Zika and this group of viruses including dengue. We know that Zika has been present in Southeast Asia and Africa for many years and yet has not taken off there as it has in South America. This is what the international research effort needs to work out, and quickly.""

Alix ensures that epithelial cells of the choroid plexus are oriented correctly with respect to one another to prevent compromise of the epithelial barrier. The research appears online in the scientific journal Nature Communications. See Also: Glimpse into the regulation of water exchange in the brain ""We have successfully developed the first mouse model for Alix that allows us to study the consequences of Alix loss of function in vivo. We were intrigued by the occurrence of hydrocephalus in the brains of these mice and began to investigate the structures within the brain that might be involved the choroid plexus and the ciliated ependyma,"" said corresponding author Alessandra d'Azzo, PhD, who holds the Jewelers For Children Endowed Chair in Genetics and Gene Therapy at St. Jude. ""Our study unravels the central role that Alix plays not only in preserving the general architecture of the epithelium and the epithelial barrier but also how this protein contributes to the maintenance of brain homeostasis."" The researchers painstakingly examined how Alix exercises these functions to promote the correct assembly and positioning of specialized intercellular junctions between epithelial cells called the tight junctions. By interacting with the actin cytoskeleton, underneath the cell outer membrane, and other structural proteins of the tight junctions, Alix ensures the formation of the actomyosin-tight junction complex at a specific position between adjacent cells. Alix therefore functions as a ""molecular bridge"" that also determines the polarity of individual epithelial cells, namely the way cells are oriented with respect to one another within the epithelial cell layer. ""We showed that the loss of Alix causes striking defects in actomyosin assembly and tight junction formation. These changes are so fundamental that they lead to prominent alterations in cell shape and loss of cell polarity, alterations that ultimately affect the epithelial barrier,"" explained d'Azzo. The epithelial barrier in the choroid plexus of the brain is the blood-cerebrospinal fluid interface. It is a crucial control point for the movement of essential ions, molecules and other metabolites, some of which help keep the production of cerebrospinal fluid finely balanced. On the one hand, cerebrospinal fluid serves as a protective barrier against mechanical damage and disease. However, excessive accumulation can lead to adverse health conditions such as hydrocephalus, as observed in this investigation. Yvan Campos, associate scientist in the St. Jude Department of Genetics and the paper's first author, was instrumental in defining Alix's precise role in the brain's choroid plexus and linking that role to disease. This was extremely challenging, since many disparate functions have been attributed to Alix in different cell types. ""We made extensive use of state-of-the art, high-resolution imaging techniques to visualize the impact of Alix deficiency on the overall organization of the choroid plexus epithelium,"" said Campos. Learn More: Unexpected link between choroid plexus, chronic pain It was through the analysis of these high-resolution images that the team made the important observation that loss of Alix leads to an increased number of cells caught in the act of being discharged from the epithelial layer. The process, called ""cell extrusion,"" is the way a new cell replaces an existing one in the epithelium by ""pushing up"" the cell to be discarded. ""It is an important physiological mechanism for the ordered removal of cells from the epithelial layer, but when it is out of control has profoundly damaging effects,"" said Campos. Unrestrained epithelial cell extrusion has been linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis in other studies. Looking ahead, this newly generated mouse model offers far-reaching scope to study the molecular bases of hydrocephalus, a fairly common clinical condition in humans, where the causes are often unknown. In addition, the combination of defective epithelial barrier and abnormal epithelial cell extrusion observed in this mouse model may be further exploited to study the role of Alix in cancer.

It was found that the death of neurons associated with the disease was prevented when chemicals that block the effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress were used. See Also: Altered circadian rhythm worsens Parkinson's disease, researchers showSome inherited forms of early-onset Parkinson's disease have typically been blamed on poorly functioning mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells. Without reliable sources of energy, neurons wither and die. This may not be the complete picture of what is happening within cells affected by Parkinson's. Researchers from the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester used a common fruit fly to investigate this further; fruit flies were used because they provide a good genetic model for humans. Studies on human subjects are of limited use for elucidating the signaling pathways and cellular processes underlying the neurodegenerative process. This is because both ethical and technical constraints limit the extent to which genetic analysis can be performed in humans. Flies are a well-established model animal to understand the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. This is because about 75 percent of human disease-causing genes are found in the fly in a similar form. Also, they are easy to work with, breed quickly and many tools are available to manipulate any genes in the fly. In flies, potential therapeutic drugs can be mixed with food and readily tested. It was found that the bulk of the damage to neurons with damaged mitochondria stems from a related but different source - the neighbouring maze-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Learn More: Antioxidant molecule could improve Parkinson'sThe ER has the important job of folding proteins so that they can do the vast majority of work within cells. Misfolded proteins are recognized by the cell as being dangerous. Cells halt protein production if there are too many of these harmful proteins present. While this system is protective, it also stalls the manufacture of vital proteins, and this eventually results in the death of neurons. The team from the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester. Credit: University of Leicester  To find out if ER stress might be at play in Parkinson's, a team led by Dr Miguel Martins analyzed fruit flies with mutant forms of the pink1 or parkin genes. Mutant forms of pink1 and parkin are already known to starve neurons from energy by preventing the disposal of defective mitochondria. These genes are also mutated in humans and result in hereditary versions of the disease. Much like Parkinson's patients, flies with either mutation move more slowly and have weakened muscles. The insects struggle to fly and they lose dopaminergic neurons in their brains - a classic feature of Parkinson's. Compared to normal flies, Miguel's team found that the mutants experienced large amounts of ER stress. The mutant flies did not manufacture proteins as quickly as the non-mutants. They also had elevated levels of the protein-folding molecule BiP, a telltale sign of stress. One function of pink1 and parkin genes is to help degrade mitofusin - a protein that tethers the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Mutant flies have an abundance of this protein. It was found that the mutants had more of their mitochondria attached to the ER than normal flies. For this reason, the researchers suggest that ER stress is related to extra tethering of mitochondria, thereby preventing the removal of defective versions of the organelle. Mutant flies, which have more of these tethers, have fewer dopaminergic neurons, which can have an adverse effect on the brain. By reducing the number of these tethers it is possible to prevent the loss of the neurons. When the researchers experimentally lowered the amount of mitofusin in the mutants, the number of tethers fell and the neuron number increased again. The flies' muscles also remained healthy despite the mitochondria themselves still being defective. Don't Miss: Effects of high-risk Parkinson s mutation are reversible These results suggest that the neurodegeneration seen in Parkinson's is a result of ER stress rather than a general failure of the mitochondria. The scientists were able to prevent neurodegeneration in mutant flies not only by reducing mitofusin, but also with chemicals that block the effects of ER stress. Dr Miguel Martins said: ""This research challenges the current held belief the Parkinson's disease is a result of malfunctioning mitochondria. By identifying and preventing ER stress in a model of the disease it was possible for us to prevent neurodegeneration. Lab experiments, like this, allow us to see what effect ER stress has on Parkinson's disease. While the finding so far only applies to fruit flies, we believe further research could find that a similar intervention in people might help treat certain forms of Parkinson's.""

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-epigenetic-influences-of-chronic-pain-211529,The Epigenetic Influences of Chronic Pain Researchers at Drexel University College of Medicine are aiming to identify new molecular mechanisms involved in pain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent, disabling and expensive public health crises in the United States. It affects more than 100 million Americans, with annual costs estimated at $635 billion, says a 2014 report from the American Pain Society. Despite the enormous societal impact of chronic pain, present treatment options are limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opioids, anticonvulsants and antidepressants, which provide pain relief to only about half of patients. Furthering the problem, prescription opioid overdoses have quadrupled since 1999. There were more than 45,000 painkiller-related deaths in 2014 alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, researchers at Drexel University College of Medicine are aiming to identify new molecular mechanisms involved in pain. Their latest study, published this month in Epigenetics & Chromatin, shows how one protein   acting as a master controller   can regulate the expression of a large number of genes that modulate pain.  The hope is that understanding this pathway would lead to the identification of genes that we can target with drugs as non-addictive options for treating chronic pain,  said Melissa Manners, PhD, lead author of the study under the supervision of principal investigator Seena Ajit, PhD, an assistant professor in the College of Medicine. In their effort to identify new drug targets, the research team explored how gene expression can be regulated by factors other than genetics. The field of epigenetics is gaining more attention, as researchers realize that genetics alone cannot explain all disease mechanisms. One protein with a critical role in mediating epigenetic changes is methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 can regulate the expression of a large number of genes by binding to DNA. Mutations in this DNA-binding protein cause Rett syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder that predominantly affects girls. Rett patients have a number of severe impairments that can hinder a child s ability to speak, walk, eat and breathe. However, a puzzling effect of this genetic mutation is the patient s higher threshold for pain, suggesting that the functional MeCP2 protein has a role in controlling pain perception. The researchers hypothesized that nerve injury can induce differences in the binding pattern of MeCP2, which, in turn, can lead to changes in the expression of a large number of downstream genes that could ultimately cause pain. Ajit and her team performed their study in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a cluster of nerve cell bodies at the root of a spinal nerve. The researchers found that MeCP2 levels are increased after nerve injury.  But we didn t know which genes are regulated by the protein and wanted to pursue an approach that has not been explored previously,  Ajit said.  It was a technically challenging study to perform, because of the small size of the DRG.  To investigate the genes regulated by MeCP2 under a chronic neuropathic pain state, the research team performed a global study to identify the DNA binding pattern in the DRG. They wanted to identify the DNA sequences in the mouse genome specifically bound by MeCP2 protein, and the changes in the regions bound by MeCP2 after nerve injury. After nerve injury, the binding pattern of MeCP2 shifted more toward regions of the DNA that code for proteins and small non-protein coding regulatory RNA molecules. These results, combined with findings from the group s previous studies, show that MeCP2 broadly binds to chromatin, and can therefore influence the expression of numerous target genes in the peripheral nervous system. The discovery provides the molecular basis for a better understanding of how MeCP2 can simultaneously regulate multiple genes involved in the pain pathway.  It is difficult to alter the function of MecP2 with a drug because of its broad expression and role,  Ajit said.  Now that we have a molecular basis to link MeCP2 to nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, we plan to further explore the targets of MeCP2 and understand how they regulate pain.

The consortium aligns four major academic institutions in a unified partnership with the shared goal of creating high-impact research programs to discover new treatments for cancer. The magnitude of the multi-institutional consortium and agreements between Celgene Corporation  and each institution will support the rapid delivery of disease-altering programs to the clinic that may ultimately benefit cancer patients, global healthcare systems and society. Subsequent to establishing the consortium, Celgene entered into four public-private collaboration agreements in which it paid a total of $50 million, $12.5 million to each institution, for the option to enter into future agreements to develop and commercialize novel cancer therapeutics arising from the consortium's efforts. Over the next ten years the institutions intend to present multiple high-impact research programs to Celgene with the goal of developing new life-saving therapeutics. Subject to Celgene's decision to opt-in and license the resulting technologies, each program has the potential to be valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. The four cancer center directors, Steven Burakoff, M.D., of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Stephen G. Emerson, M.D., Ph.D., of Columbia University, William Nelson, M.D., Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University and Chi Van Dang, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a shared statement, ""The active and coordinated engagement, creative thinking and unique perspectives and expertise of each institution have made this collaboration a reality.

A team led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, uncovered five new potential genes which, when mutated, appeared to cause bowel cancer in a very low proportion of cases. Further research is needed to confirm these links as the mutations were very rare   each being linked to only a handful of cases in the 1,000-strong patient cohort. The study, largely funded by Cancer Research UK, also concluded that the major genes that greatly increase the risk of bowel cancer have now almost certainly been found.  Familial cases Researchers found that added together, all the discovered variants in the known bowel cancer genes accounted for less than a third of familial cases of bowel cancer   those occurring in people whose close relatives had already developed it. The rest of the familial cases must therefore be caused largely by minor DNA variations that in combination add up to increase risk, the study found, with environmental factors also contributing. For an individual person, the risk of developing bowel cancer comes from a mix of inherited risk through their genes and environmental risk, which is caused by non-genetic factors such as lifestyle. Around 12% of cases occur in people with a family history of bowel cancer, with inherited mutations in known cancer-causing genes such as APC and MLH1 often playing a major role. The researchers explored the genetics of bowel cancer further by sequencing all the DNA used to produce protein   the exome   from 1,000 patients who developed the disease at a relatively young age and had a strong family history. Twelve key genes These patients   with a strong inherited component to their cancer risk   were selected from a repository of more than 25,000 cases held at the ICR. The ICR researchers concluded that beyond the five potential new genes identified there were unlikely to be any further major bowel cancer genes   pinning down the total number to around 12, excluding the five potential new ones. Mutations in those genes accounted for 15-31% of the 1,000 familial cases, meaning that much of the remaining risk must come from common variations in DNA, each with only a small individual impact on risk. This suggests that these minor variations   around 30 of which have been discovered so far   are more important to inherited risk than previously thought. Many more of these are yet to be discovered, meaning that more research is required in order to identify them. The discovery of these variants could lead to essential new understandings of the biology of bowel cancer and potentially new ways to prevent it. A new chapter begins Study leader Professor Richard Houlston, Professor of Molecular and Population Genetics at the ICR, said:  Our study is the largest ever conducted of the genetics of bowel cancer, and sets out a detailed map of the disease that could lead us to new ways of treating or preventing it.  The research closes one chapter in the study of bowel cancer, by concluding that all the major risk genes have now been found. But it opens another by underlining the importance of tracking down the many missing genetic variations which each have a very small effect alone, but together make the biggest impact on inherited risk.  Each cancer gene that has been discovered, or common genetic variant that we will continue to uncover, provides us with new insights into the underlying biology of the disease, and increases our ability to assess people for their risk.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of the ICR, said:  This study represents an important contribution to our understanding of the genetics of bowel cancer. It provides a marker of the dramatic progress we have made so far in decoding the inherited risk of the disease, and gives us confidence that the most important risk genes have now been found.  Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK s Science Information Manager, said:  Understanding the faulty genes that play a role in the development of bowel cancer in people who have a strong family history of the disease could shed light on the biology underpinning it, and lead to new ways to prevent and treat the disease in future.

In June 2013, TB Alliance and Takeda initiated a program to screen Takeda s library of 20,000 proprietary compounds to identify potential candidates that showed promise to be further developed into new TB treatments. This new collaboration advances the successful hits from the screening program, which was also funded by GHIT Fund. This partnership complements TB Alliance s existing work in advancing the pipeline for new TB drugs. For Takeda, this program with TB Alliance is an excellent opportunity to leverage, as part of Takeda s corporate social responsibility program, the company s drug discovery expertise for communicable diseases, in addition to Takeda s focus on the oncology, gastroenterology and central nervous system therapeutic areas. TB is the leading infectious disease killer in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 9.6 million people were infected with TB in 2014. In the same year, 1.5 million people lost their lives to the disease, 95% of whom lived in low- to middle-income countries. Today s existing TB treatments are complicated and require a minimum of six months of treatment, imposing a heavy burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. Treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis can take two years or longer and is much more expensive and complicated. Given this global health threat, new TB drugs and regimens that are simpler to administer, are of shorter duration, and can overcome drug resistance are urgently needed. The collaboration will leverage both TB Alliance s and Takeda s experience, knowledge and technology to discover and pursue optimal lead compounds for intervention against TB. Through these initiatives, TB Alliance and Takeda aim to contribute to the eradication of TB and improve the health and quality of life for millions of people.","Published: June 23, 2016"

These markers will be developed to ensure the right treatment for the right patient as early as possible. The Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, which is funded by a philanthropic gift from the Stoller Charitable Trust, the Medical Research Council and in partnership with SCIEX, will help to industrialise the process of identifying biomarkers   the molecular clues that indicate the presence of a disease or other condition. By detecting these on a scale never seen before in Europe, University scientists and clinicians will be able to work with health companies and the NHS to produce a greater number of tests and develop new treatments to accelerate the process of curing many of the most serious illnesses faced today. Medicines have historically been developed for whole populations, but biomarkers help to stratify patients so they get the right treatment for them   not one size fits all. In cancer work already ongoing in the Centre has identified possible tests to detect ovarian cancer earlier, gaining valuable advantage by being able to treat this disease earlier and therefore more effectively. Professor Tony Whetton is the Director of the new Centre. He said:  The Centre is a major step forward in precision medicine. Essentially this is the future of healthcare   getting the right treatment to the right person at the right time and in the right dose.  Without the knowledge of biomarkers we won t be able to identify which people need treatment or who will benefit from certain medicines, so this new centre underpins everything we re doing in precision medicine in Manchester and beyond.  The Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre will start work on addressing some of the biggest issues in medicine in an environment where these discoveries can move quickly to improve people s lives The Stoller Biomarker Centre is located at CityLabs Manchester, in the midst of biotechnology companies, the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and The University of Manchester. The new Centre is stocked with a large suite of high-end SCIEX mass spectrometers, including TripleTOF  6600 Systems with SWATH Acquisition, QTRAP  6500+ Systems, and the SCIEX Lipidyzer Platform, for measuring molecules in proteins (proteomics). The University of Manchester has also invested in a number of liquid chromatography and automated sample preparation components for the Centre, from SCIEX and other Danaher life science companies.  SCIEX s mission of innovating integrated, reliable analytical tools to gain scientific understandings that lead to better health, enables our customers to advance precision medicine with scale and speed like never before,  said Jean-Paul Mangeolle, President of SCIEX.  And it takes more than providing great instruments to be part of a movement as important as precision medicine; it takes strong collaborations with customers, partnerships with industry leaders and teamwork with our colleagues at other the Danaher Corporation life companies, to establish and deploy the most comprehensive proteomics solutions.  The Centre was officially opened during a special two day conference (14-15 June), which attracted some of the biggest names in medical research such as Dr Leroy Hood, Dr Leigh Anderson, and Professor Jennifer Van Eyk. The Centre will build on research carried out at Manchester including discovering new markers for the earlier detection of cancers   crucial in starting early treatment to save lives. Work to identify new biomarkers for diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular, Alzheimer s and psoriasis will also be enhanced. The Centre will work in the newly devolved healthcare system in Greater Manchester, as the city-region and major bodies and companies operating within it work to remove bottlenecks such as making the transition from lab to bedside with new tests and drugs. President and Vice-Chancellor of The University of Manchester, Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell said:  Manchester has become a major hub for precision medicine and proteomics we are very grateful to the funders who have backed the cutting-edge work that is carried out by our scientists.

As part of the research collaboration, Waters and BTI will develop a glycosphingolipid (GSL) head group database containing glucose unit (GU) retention times1 and collision cross-section (CCS) values in an effort to compile an experimental library for disease-related GSL glycans together with a glycan/MS spectral library. GSLs are highly complex structures in which glycan head groups are attached to fatty acyl moieties. Analyzing their molecular composition involves detailing the sequence, anomericity, branching, and linkage positions of the oligosaccharides as well as their fatty acyl motifs. GSLs are critical for cell growth, interaction, and signaling and alterations to their structure may result in diseases or promote the development of different types of cancer. The analysis of the glycan head groups poses a particular analytical challenge for glycoscience because isomeric structures are not easily differentiated by either liquid chromatography (LC) or mass spectrometry (MS) technologies when used alone.  Collaborating with Waters will enable BTI to apply its expertise in glycomics to develop analytical methods and a library of information on GSLs that doesn t yet exist today. This will allow us to probe for potential clinical markers and to provide insights into disease progression and regression following therapeutic intervention. We anticipate our science will advance human health while at the same time address some of the needs of the biopharmaceutical industry,  said scientific lead Dr. Susanto Woen, Research Scientist, BTI.  The partnership also allows us to be part of an international glycomics research network pioneering technologies required to determine the potential association between GSL glycosylation and any phenotypic/genotypic traits in disease or disease states.   By taking our partnership to a new level, we will empower BTI to further develop novel analytical methods and establish a comprehensive experimental glycan spectral library for cancer glycobiology focusing on glycosphingolipids. Together, we want to advance methods to study GSL glycosylation in cancer classification and biomarker discovery,  said Dr. Jose Castro-Perez, Director   Health Sciences Marketing, Waters Corporation. As part of this collaboration, Waters will be contributing scientific expertise and the use of a Waters  SYNAPT  G2-S High Definition Mass Spectrometry  System. The instrument features ion mobility mass spectrometry technology that rapidly separates molecular ions by not only their size and mass-to-charge ratio, but by their shape as well. A collisional cross-section (CCS) value is a precise physicochemical property of an ion related to its size, shape, and charge in the gas phase. The ability to determine the separation of molecules based on a CCS value for each glycan head group reveals insights into their unique chemical structure, which in turn can be used as an additional descriptor for the GSL in question, thus providing a higher degree of specificity than using just mass-to-charge ratio alone.","Published: June 23, 2016"

The announcement marks the next step in the global CDMO s plans to invest  40m over the next three years to ensure solutions for serialisation processes. The investment will ensure that pharmaceutical companies accessing Recipharm s manufacturing services will comply with the EU Falsified Medicines Directive (EUFMD) Safety Features Delegated Regulation, which makes serialisation of licensed drug products in Europe a legal requirement from early 2019. After assessing various vendors, Recipharm selected Italian-based Marchesini and SEA Vision tomeet its hardware and software requirements for serialisation at levels 1 (device level), 2 (line level) and 3 (site level). The company has also selected the TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud, the world s largest pharmaceutical track and trace network, which will act as a level 4 central repository to meet the CDMO s enterprise serialisation management and global tracking needs. The complete serialisation solution will be implemented in 15 of Recipharm s European locations and on more than 70 production lines. The company anticipates that a pilot showcase line will be operational from July 2016 to allow customers to view and trial Recipharm s standard solution for serialisation and aggregation. The CDMO s company-wide serialisation project is being led by Staffan Widengren, Director Corporate Projects at Recipharm. He said:  At an early stage, we took the decision to lead the market and make a significant investment into state-of-the-art solutions to actively help pharmaceutical companies meet new drug serialisation requirements.   Recipharm already provides serialised products in markets including Turkey, Korea and China so we understand that the process can be complex and time consuming, particularly if the right tools and expertise are not in place.   We have undertaken an extensive evaluation process to ensure we partner with experts that willallow us to best support our customers on their serialisation journeys. It was clear that Marchesiniand SEA Vision have a very strong relationship, which would allow us to seamlessly implement the hardware and software required for serialisation. As a global CDMO, the flexibility of a cloud-based central repository and the easy network connectivity to our pharma clients were also key factors in our decision to collaborate with TraceLink.  The collaboration will see over 75 production lines equipped with Marchesini and SEA Vision machines and software during 2016-2018 to meet the various local requirements of each of the CDMO s sites. Marco Baietti, commercial director at SEA Vision, said:  As a CDMO, Recipharm is leading the way in preparing for serialisation and ensuring the challenge is high on its agenda. We are delighted to support the company on its serialisation journey and look forward to a successful partnership.  Pietro Tomasi, commercial director at Marchesini Group added:  We are really pleased that a notable company such as Recipharm has chosen Marchesini Group to carry out this project. Our serialisation and track and trace solutions offer a high level of customisation and we look forward to working with Recipharm to ensure the company is well prepared for the new regulations.  Recipharm serves 250+ customers and expects 85% of its production to require serialisation. TheCDMO will also be ready for US serialisation from November 2017 in-line with the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).","Published: June 23, 2016"

The Affimer reagents bind a protein called NS1 which is diagnostic of the early, acute stage of Zika infection and for which no validated antibody is available. Highlights the potential of Affimer technology to support global rapid response for novel point-of-care diagnostics and health screening. Avacta has announced it has identified three Affimer proteins capable of binding to a recombinant form of a secreted Zika virus NS1 protein (Non-Structural protein 1), which is diagnostic of Zika virus infection at the early, acute stage. These Affimer binders were identified and characterised within just thirteen weeks of receiving the virus target and have the potential to be developed into new rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests for Zika infection. The three Affimer binders are highly specific to the Zika NS1 protein and can differentiate in human serum from five other closely related viruses that give similar symptoms: Dengue, Yellow Fever, West Nile, and Japanese and Tick-borne Encephalitis. Since these viruses are very similar, there is currently no validated antibody that detects Zika virus specifically, which is a limiting factor in the development of a reliable, quick diagnostic test. The ability to rapidly generate new diagnostic reagents in response to outbreaks of infectious agents is critical to meeting an urgent medical need, as recently evidenced by the SARS and Ebola virus outbreaks. The very high specificity of Avacta s Affimer technology, together with the speed with which new Affimer binders can be identified and characterised, makes the technology ideal for rapidly responding to the need for detection and monitoring of new outbreaks. The Group intends to commercialise Affimer based rapid diagnostics through co-development and licensing to third party diagnostics developers an example of which is Mologic, a UK rapid diagnostics developer, with whom a research and product development collaboration was recently announced. Dr Alastair Smith, Chief Executive Officer, Avacta, said:  Avacta s Affimer technology offers a distinct advantage over antibodies in infectious disease diagnostics in terms of both rapid development times and specificity. The identification of these three Affimer binders means that new diagnostic tests could be developed that have the potential to diagnose a Zika infection from its early stages, and would be suitable for low cost, rapid point-of-care diagnostics that could be deployed widely in the field or at US transport hubs for example. At the half year we set out three initial strategic priorities for the Affimer technology, outside of therapeutic applications, in which we believe that the technology has key competitive advantages. Rapid diagnostics is one of those strategic priorities and the news that we have been able to generate highly specific Affimer binders to a significant emerging health threat in such a short space of time is strong validation of those advantages. The success of this work shows that the Affimer technology is a platform that can be applied more broadly to generate highly specific binders rapidly. We continue to execute our strategy of developing Affimer reagents for third party products as well as developing our in-house therapeutics pipeline focused on immuno-oncology. I look forward to the next opportunity to update the market. ","Published: June 23, 2016"

Nearly 10 million Americans, or 4.1 percent of the adult population, used opioid medications in 2012-2013 a class of drugs that includes OxyContin and Vicodin, without a prescription or not as prescribed (in greater amounts, more often, or longer than prescribed) in the past year. This is up from 1.8 percent of the adult population in 2001-2002. More than 11 percent of Americans report nonmedical use of prescription opioids at some point in their lives, a considerable increase from 4.7 percent ten years prior. The number of people who meet the criteria for prescription opioid addiction has substantially increased during this timeframe as well, with 2.1 million adults (0.9 percent of the U.S. adult population) reporting symptoms of  nonmedical prescription opioid use disorder (NMPOUD),  according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).  The increasing misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers poses a myriad of serious public health consequences,  said Nora D. Volkow, M.D., director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which contributed funding for the study.  These include increases in opioid use disorders and related fatalities from overdoses, as well as the rising incidence of newborns who experience neonatal abstinence syndrome. In some instances, prescription opioid misuse can progress to intravenous heroin use with consequent increases in risk for HIV, hepatitis C and other infections among individuals sharing needles.  Scientists analyzed data from NIAAA s National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III), ongoing research that examines alcohol and drug use disorders among the U.S. population, as well as associated mental health conditions. The study appears online in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Prescription opioid misuse is an urgent public health problem, with drug poisoning deaths involving opioid analgesics, which includes both prescription and illicit opioids, quadrupling between 1999 and 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Emergency department visits increased by 153 percent from 2004 to 2011, based on data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration s Drug Abuse Warning Network.  Given the dramatic increase in nonmedical use of prescription opioids, it is important that clinicians and patients also recognize the potent interaction of opioids with alcohol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs   an interaction that can be lethal,  said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D. People who develop alcohol use disorder at some point in their lives are nearly twice as likely to also develop opioid use disorder, based on NESARC-III data. Similar to other substance use disorders, prescription opioid use disorder includes symptoms such as:  taking the drug in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended the persistent desire to cut down or control use/unsuccessful efforts to do so failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school or home as a result of prescription opioid use symptoms of tolerance and/or withdrawal Rates of nonmedical prescription opioid use were greatest among men, those with annual incomes less than $70,000, those previously married, and with a high school-level education or less. Use was greater among whites and Native Americans and those living in the Midwest and West. Study results also show that few people misusing prescription opioids receive treatment. Based on NESARC-III data, only about 5 percent of people misusing prescription opioids in the past year and 17 percent of those with prescription opioid use disorder ever receive help. Evidence-based treatment options for addiction to prescription opioids include medications and behavioral counseling approaches.  The national data from NESARC-III substantially advances what we know about prevalence, co-occurring disorders and treatment rates,  said senior author Bridget Grant, Ph.D., Ph.D., chief of the NIAAA Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biometry.  Prior to this analysis, there was a lack of current epidemiologic data on nonmedical prescription opioid use and prescription opioid use disorder using DSM-5 criteria.  Based on the 2012-2013 NESARC-III data, 2.1 percent of U.S. adults (4.8 million) have ever had prescription opioid use disorder in their lifetime and 0.9 percent had this disorder in the past year, according to DSM-5 criteria. This compares to 1.4 percent lifetime and 0.4 percent past year rates in 2001-2002, with slightly different criteria under the DSM-IV. Rates for 2012-2013 NESARC-III using DSM-IV criteria were 2.9 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Overall, the study found that nonmedical prescription opioid use among U.S. adults has increased by 161 percent from 2001-2002 to 2012-2013 while prescription opioid use disorder has increased by 125 percent. The authors suggest that this may be due in part to increase in opioid prescribing and dosage, lessened perception of risk because of its legality, and lack of understanding of addictive potential. The researchers found that nonmedical prescription opioid use and prescription opioid use disorder are linked to other drug use disorders, and a variety of mental health disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline, schizotypal, and antisocial personality disorder. Persistent depression and major depressive disorder are linked to nonmedical prescription opioid use, while bipolar I disorder is linked to prescription opioid use disorder. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the primary U.S. agency for conducting and supporting research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and alcohol problems.

Young teens who suffer from anxiety are also more vulnerable to additional problems like depression, drug dependence, suicidal behavior and educational underachievement. The National Institutes of Mental Health (U.S.) reports that 8 per cent of teens ages 13 to 18 have an anxiety disorder, with anxiety-related problems often peaking during this time. Most adults diagnosed with anxiety or mood disorders also report the presence of symptoms earlier in their lives.

Conte Center for Neuroscience grant. This research constitutes the first twin study-based examination of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to both low attention control and four distinct anxiety symptoms in early adolescence. The researchers used a combination of self-ratings and mother ratings to assess scores for obsessive, social, separation and generalized anxiety symptoms in 446 twin pairs with a mean age of 13.6 years, all enrolled in the Wisconsin Twin Project. They then explored the extent to which links between low levels of attention and anxiety symptoms are genetically and environmentally mediated in adolescence. Non-shared environmental influences were significant across attention control and all anxiety variables. Genetic correlations ranged from 36 to 47 per cent, a pattern that suggests that low attention can be considered a phenotypic and genetic risk factor for anxiety. Learn More: Social anxiety is highly heritable but is affected by environment Risk level varied, however, depending on the specific type of disorder, with the highest correlations being for generalized and separation anxieties, and the lowest for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Perry Fuchs, chair of UTA's department of Psychology in the College of Science, emphasized the importance of this work in the context of the university's increasing focus on health and the human condition within the Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact. ""Adolescence is clearly an important development period,"" Fuchs said. ""Better assessment of teens' ability to concentrate could facilitate the identification of those at risk of anxiety and could also inform molecular genetic studies, which would be the logical next stage for research.""

The study, published in the journal Nature, says 50 percent of patients who survive the most damaging kind of West Nile infection often go on to develop memory loss, learning difficulties, a lack of concentration and irritability. Exactly why this happens has been a mystery until now. See Also: Vaccination on the horizon for severe viral infection of the brain Researchers discovered that the virus doesn't kill off neurons but sparks inflammation that prunes synapses. ""What we found in mice, and later confirmed in humans, is that it's not the death of cells that causes memory loss, it's the loss of nerve cell connections,"" said study co-author Kenneth Tyler, MD, chairman of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""The viral infection activates microglial cells and complement pathways which are helping to fight the infection but in turn end up destroying synapses."" Bette DeMasters, MD, professor and head of neuropathology at CU Anschutz, also co-authored the study. The researchers found that mice infected with West Nile had a difficult time negotiating their way out of a maze that healthy mice figured out much faster. They later discovered that the infected mice suffered significant damage to their synapses. The scientists examined brain tissue from humans who had died from West Nile and found the same phenomenon. Tyler said West Nile is the leading cause of acute viral encephalitis in the U.S. though still relatively rare. Only about one in 100 people infected with the disease develop the most severe form, he said. Learn More: Some chronic viral infections could contribute to cognitive decline with aging West Nile appeared in the U.S. during the late 1990s and has remained a persistent threat. Last year, California had 730 cases, Texas 252 cases and Colorado 101cases. In Colorado, that number included 57 neuro-invasive cases, the most serious kind, and two deaths. ""This discovery opens up the opportunity to test therapies and medications on mice as a precursor to humans,"" Tyler said. ""We already have some drugs that might be good candidates for treating this condition."" The best way to avoid West Nile is to wear long sleeves, use mosquito repellant and steer clear of standing water. The mosquito that carries the virus is most active at dusk and dawn.

The findings show that long-term suppression of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine a target for anticholinergic drugs results in dementia-like changes in the brain. ""There have been several epidemiological studies showing that people who use these drugs for a long period of time increase their risk of developing dementia,"" said Marco Prado, PhD, a Scientist at the Robarts Research Institute and Professor in the departments of Physiology and Pharmacology and Anatomy & Cell Biology at Western's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. ""So the question we asked is 'why?'"" See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression For this study, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, the researchers used genetically modified mouse models to block acetylcholine in order to mimic the action of the drugs in the brain. Neurons that use acetylcholine are known to be affected in Alzheimer's disease; and the researchers were able to show a causal relationship between blocking acetylcholine and Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice. ""We hope that by understanding what is happening in the brain due to the loss of acetylcholine, we might be able to find new ways to decrease Alzheimer's pathology,"" said Prado. Prado and his partner Dr. Vania Prado, DDS, PhD, along with PhD candidates Ben Kolisnyk and Mohammed Al-Onaizi, have shown that blocking acetylcholine-mediated signals in neurons causes a change in approximately 10 per cent of the messenger RNA (mRNA) in a region of the brain responsible for declarative memory. Messenger RNA encodes for specific amino acids which are the building blocks for proteins and several of the changes they uncovered in the brains of mutant mice are similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease. ""We demonstrated that in order to keep neurons healthy you need acetylcholine,"" said Prado. ""So if acetylcholine actions are suppressed, brain cells respond by drastically changing their messenger RNA and when they age, they show signs of pathology that have many of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease."" Importantly, by targeting one of the messenger RNA pathways they uncovered, the researchers improved pathology in the mutant mice. Learn More: Researchers develop blood test that detects early Alzheimer's disease The study, conducted at Western's Robarts Research Institute, used human tissue samples to validate the mouse data and mouse models to show not only the physical changes in the brain, but also behavioral and memory changes.

""When the mutant mice were old, memory tasks they mastered at young age were almost impossible for them, whereas normal mice still performed well,"" said Kolisnyk.

The study results may have implications for children who must have several surgeries, and so are exposed repeatedly to general anesthesia. Past studies have linked such exposure to a higher incidence of learning disabilities, attention deficits and hyperactivity. See Also: How anesthesia's brain effects differ in older adults and in childrenSpecifically, the research team found that the experimental drug CX456, part of the AMPAkine class in clinical trials for several neurological conditions, counters for the dampening effect of anesthesia on nerve signaling. The treatment bolstered nerve cell activity as well as learning ability in mice recovering from repeated exposure to general anesthesia. ""Each year, in the United States alone, more than a million children under age four undergo surgical procedures that require anesthesia, and the numbers are growing,"" says the study's senior investigator Guang Yang, PhD, assistant professor of anesthesiology at NYU Langone. ""There are currently no effective treatments to combat potential toxicity linked to repeated anesthesia, and we would like to change that."" Yang's group took advantage of genetically engineered young mice that have protein markers which glow in response to changes in nerve function. Researchers then used advanced microscopy to visualize activity in their brains, comparing nerve signaling activity in those exposed to anesthesia to those who were not. The research team found that anesthesia exposure resulted in a prolonged reduction of signal transmission among nerve cells following anesthesia. They also observed that CX456 treatment enhances this transmission, along with learning and memory in mice exposed to anesthesia.

We start learning from our parents before we can even remember and the words and sounds are imprinted in our memory at an early age. Learning a new language as an adult is much more difficult, involves a lot of hard work, and you may never have the same fluency as with your first language. The same is true of songbirds. Zebra finches learn their song when they are young by listening to their father s or tutor s song. See Also: Neurotransmitter GABA predicts learning Recently, Prof. Yoko Yazaki-Sugiyama and Dr. Shin Yanagihara from Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan have, for the first time, identified the neurons in the brain that are associated with the auditory memory of the father s song in zebra finches, which could lead to insight into human speech development. They have recently published their findings in Nature Communications.  For young animals, the early sensory experiences are very important and strongly affect brain development,  Yanagihara, staff scientist in OIST s Neuronal Mechanism for Critical Period Unit said.   This stage is called the  critical period  where the brain circuits are very flexible and can be easily changed and modified. We wanted to know how the early sensory experiences during the critical period shape brain circuits and lead to appropriate behaviors.  In zebra finches, only males learn and sing songs, as this is the way they attract a mate. Therefore, learning a complex song to attract the lady zebra finches is crucial for reproduction. The juvenile zebra finches do this by listening to the father s song and memorizing it. When they begin to vocalize, it is thought that through their auditory memory of the tutor song they can recall the sounds and gradually adapt their song until they develop their own song, which is comparable to their tutor s song. Learn More: Learning with all the senses: Movements and images facilitate vocabulary learning  This is similar to human speech development,  Yanagihara said.  During the critical period children listen to adult speech and their brain circuits are shaped to capture auditory features of that speech. We predicted that when birds listen to father s song, these experiences modify the juvenile birds  brain circuits to form a memory of it.  To confirm their prediction and learn more about where the memory of the tutor song is stored, the researchers looked at the response of neurons in the higher auditory cortex which is a part of the specialized neural circuit to the sound of the tutor song. They monitored the neuronal auditory response when the birds listened to different songs their own, the tutor, other zebra finches, and the songs of different songbird species in tutored juvenile birds and in isolated juvenile control birds. The team monitored responses in single neurons and collected information from many neurons from many birds. Through this method, they found that there were non-selective neurons that responded to all the songs, but also selective neurons that had a very selective, and in many cases, exclusive, response to the tutor songs.  In the normal, tutored birds, we encountered a group of neurons that responded very strongly to the tutor song, after they had learned the song, but did not respond to the other songs,  Yanagihara said.  However, for the birds which had no tutor experiences, we did not see any response to the tutor-song, or in this case the genetic-father-song, and no selective neurons at all.  The team found that approximately five percent of the neurons in the higher auditory cortex reacted to the tutor song and that this could be indicative of where the early auditory memory is located in the brain. Don't Miss: Dopamine key to vocal learning, songbird study finds We found 27 neurons that selectively respond to the tutor song,  Yanagihara said.  We believe that these tutor song selective neurons represent the memory of the tutor song and that learning the tutor song during the critical period changes the neural circuits to accommodate this memory.  This is important because the brain mechanisms during the critical period are still not very well understood. These findings could be a step in grasping how the brain circuit is shaped during this early stage development and how these neuronal circuits contribute to higher cognitive function in adulthood.  This study gives some idea of how the brain acquires memories during the critical period,  Yanagihara said.  This is a step in understanding how the neuronal mechanisms of memory and early sensory experiences form brain circuits in the early developmental stage, not only in birds, but also in humans and other species.

Using a combination of in vivo video imaging, confocal microscopy and flow cell cytometry on platelets, neutrophils, monocytes and their associated signalling molecules, researchers from the University of Munich have systematically studied and demonstrated the complex cell-cell and molecular interactions which take place in the microvasculature of a mouse muscle inflammation model. The movement of leukocytes (white blood cells) from the bloodstream to the surrounding tissue (extravasation) is a prerequisite for effective immune responses. To enter a site of inflammation, leukocytes  roll  on the luminal surface of microvascular endothelial cells then stabilize and adhere to the inner vessel wall in order to find their way to extravasation  hot spots . Zuchtriegel et al. found that upon onset of an inflammatory response, platelets immediately adhere to specific sites in micro vessels and capture intravascularly crawling neutrophils via CD40-CD40L/CD154-dependent interactions. Adherent platelets and neutrophils then cooperatively recruited monocytes to these  hotspots  through aCD40-, CD40L/CD154-, and L-selectin/CD62L-mediated association. The researchers systematically screened candidate adhesion molecules for their functional relevance in mediating interactions of platelets with endothelial cells and neutrophils during inflammation. They found that the cellular crosstalk from these interactions led to an activation of surface-expressed leukocyte integrins, which subsequently promoted the successive extravasation of neutrophils and monocytes from these  hot spots  into the interstitial tissue. The research conducted to fully understand this mechanism might now provide therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory pathologies.

Biopharmaceuticals are deemed to be the length and breadth of healthcare in the future; primarily because of the potential benefits they offer over small molecules, such as stronger focus on target diseases, more effective and potent action, their potential to cure diseases, rather than just treating the symptoms and lesser adverse effects.  Biopharmaceuticals can take forms of monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and regenerative medicines. They find extensive applications in research, therapeutics and diagnostics. As per recent Frost & Sullivan analysis, biologics will continue to outpace overall pharma spending growth and are expected to represent 19-20 percent of the total pharma market value by 2020. The biopharmaceutical industry is estimated to be worth $204.8 billion as of 2015 with the R&D expenditure summing up to $37.3 billion. It is expected to reach US$314.8 billion by 2020, which represents a 9 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2015 and 2020. Humira, Enbrel, Remicade, Rituxan, Lantus, Avastin, Herceptin and Prevnar are eight biologic drugs out of the top ten drugs by sales in 2015. These molecules represent a total of US$65.15 billion in market size. Biologics growth is primarily driven by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and human insulin, with six out of the top ten drugs by sales in 2015 being mAbs. Manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals is a capital intensive, complex and highly technical process in comparison to manufacturing of small molecules. Advances in upstream, downstream bioprocessing, lyophilization and process analytical technology as well as the advent of newer technologies such as production of biopharmaceuticals using transgenic plants and animals, stem cells and cloning, which are still at an infancy stage, are likely to have a direct impact on biopharmaceutical contract manufacturers. In particular, attractive opportunities in disposable equipment/single-use bioreactors and perfusion technology are disrupting the traditional model of biologic manufacturers.   Single use technology was first introduced in 1970s in the form of disposable capsules and range of filters. The development of disposable bio-containers started in the early 1980s followed by single-use bags for storage and transport of buffer and media by Hyclone in the 1990s. Finally, large scale tube welders and sterile connectors were introduced in the 2000s. BioProcess System Alliance, was established during the same time to promote the best practices for implementation of SUTs. Disposable equipment/single-use bioreactors are considered a viable alternative to conventional stainless steel equipment in biotech contract manufacturing because of their high degree of flexibility, short start-up time, quick changeover between production campaigns as well as absence of clean-in-place, steam-in-place, and large volumes of water for injection. Single use technologies are specially designed for multi-product contract manufacturing with additional benefits, such as simple transfer of operations between sites, and their ability to easily expand to accommodate larger volumes. They find extensive applications in busy facilities and smaller operations devoid of non-value adding activities. It becomes increasingly important to adopt the work flow, facility design, and scale-up strategies to the features of the disposable equipment, failing which heavy costs are to be incurred. However, usage of single use bioreactors (SUBs) is restricted to operations that do not exceed 2,000 L production scale. At present, disposable equipment are widely implemented for seed bio reactors and storing buffers. Disposables are increasingly gaining acceptance among cell culture engineers and recently, disposable chromatography columns have also been introduced. Therefore, there is a prominent trend among contract manufacturers towards the use of disposable technology, as it helps lower production costs by virtue of their customisable design, enhanced productivity, and significant operational benefits. Perfusion technology is the ability to culture cells for a longer duration (in months) by continuously feeding fresh media and removing the spent media using either membranes or filters or centrifuge. A high number of cells can be maintained in each cell culture batch by constantly feeding fresh raw materials. Optimum conditions for production are achieved by inducing raw materials and removing waste elements. This technology can be used in tandem with continuous manufacturing processes. As an example, Sanofi is coming up with three 4000L perfusion based bioreactors for their Belgian site. Boehringer Ingelheim is also planning to implement perfusion technology in their Vienna site. Samsung Biologics was the first CMO to provide N-1 perfusion services at large scale. Process analytical technologies are ideal to be used with perfusion system for monitoring quality and critical limits of the involved processes. Since there is no down time, perfusion improves productivity by saving time and rolling out finished products in an uninterrupted fashion. Traditional batch fed technology consists of tanks with a capacity of 10000-25000 litres in which cell cultures run in batches of 7-21 days post which the cultured cells are separated from the cell mass. Yields from batch fed technology are typically in the range of 1-4 gms/ litre depending on clone and antibody. A 50 Litre perfusion bioreactor produces equivalent to 1000L batch fed bioreactor. GE Healthcare s WAVE bioreactor and iCELL fixed/packed bed bioreactors are some leading products applying this technology. This increased product quality, stability, scalability, cost saving and higher automation levels of production with smaller size of bioreactors is the way forward in biologic manufacturing.  Thus, biopharmaceutical manufacturers continue to focus on gaining efficiency and boosting productivity, through better integration of processes and remaining at the forefront of technology to capture opportunities, survive disruption and emerge as winners.Unmesh Lal is Program Manager, Life Sciences at Frost & Sullivan.

These findings can potentially be used in developing efficient and environmentally-conscious coagulants for water treatment. The findings were presented on May 29, 2016 at the 76th Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry Symposium. In order to provide clear, safe tap water it is necessary to remove particles called colloids from raw water. These particles are very small, between nanometer order and micrometer order in diameter. Polychlorinated aluminum is used as a coagulant in the water treatment process to collect and dispose of these particles. However, aluminum ions can be toxic for fish and inhibit plant growth. The Japanese Water Works Law specifies that aluminum concentration in water must be limited to below 0.1ppm (1:10,000,000). Various hydrolyzed species of aluminum ion can be detected in water. Until now the  ferron method , involving pigments and absorption meters, has been widely used to calculate the concentration of these compounds. However, this method has some disadvantages: the analysis takes several hours and the results often contain errors. Associate Professor Maki s research group optimized NMR  equipment to develop an analysis method called  27Al qNMR (quantitative NMR) spectroscopy  that accurately measures the abundance of each aluminum compound. Notably, measurements using this analysis method can be carried out in just three minutes, and the concentration of hydrolyzed species can be calculated to within a very small margin of error in all pH ranges. After the agglomeration mechanism of sludge including the aluminum ion was analyzed, the group discovered that when there is a high concentration of aluminum ions, after roughly 100 minutes a Keggin-type tridecameric cluster (K-Al13 ) is formed, and after a few months polymerization occurs. As well as making it easier to measure the concentration of aluminum ions in water, this new analysis method has also clarified the structural changes aluminum ions undergo over time. These findings could potentially contribute to the development of high-performance, environmentally-conscious coagulants that can act more efficiently on colloids.","Published: June 22, 2016"

""In the U.S. you only need to think about current problems such as Emerald Ash Borer or the Asian Tiger Mosquito and the potential threat of Zika virus to appreciate this. One of the challenges we face is predicting the next threat and where it will come from. This study explores some of these issues at a global scale."" The researchers, who report their findings today (June 20) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed the impact of 1,297 known invasive insect pests and pathogens on 124 countries. They also determined which countries posed the biggest threats based on their trading partners and numbers of invasive species. The United States, China, India and Brazil, all large agricultural producers, would have the highest potential cost from invasive species, according to the researchers. China and the United States ranked one and two, respectively, as the highest potential source countries for the pests. ""China and the U.S. are large and have diverse cropping systems ranging from subtropical to temperate environments and this diversity of cropping systems supports a wide range of potential pest and disease species,"" said Thomas, who is also a co-funded faculty member of the Huck Institute, Penn State. ""Also, China and the U.S. have very active trading relationships with many countries worldwide and these provide potential links for transport of pest and disease organisms to novel areas."" While big agricultural countries, such as the United States and China, may take the biggest monetary hit, smaller developing countries may suffer proportionately higher damage. Dean Paini, senior research scientist, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and Plant Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre, who worked with Thomas, said the most vulnerable countries were located in sub-Saharan Africa. ""These countries generally do not have diverse economies making them disproportionately more dependent on agriculture,"" Paini said. ""As a result any threat from invasive species can potentially have a greater relative impact on these countries."" To estimate the relative cost of species invasion, the researchers divided a country s total invasion cost by its mean domestic product from 2000 to 2009. As trade increases and more connections are made between countries, the researchers suggest that the problems associated with invasive species will mount. ""Dealing with this problem is a major challenge,"" said Thomas. ""We hope that by identifying the countries and regions that are most vulnerable, our study can help governments make informed decisions regarding the deployment of resources necessary to protect their borders and agriculture industries by limiting the further spread of invasive species.""","Published: June 22, 2016"

A general consensus among scientists is that these subpopulations are due to random mutations. However, Moffitt Cancer Center researchers found that these assumptions may be incorrect. In a new article published in the journal Cancer Research, they report that certain subpopulations can be predicted and do not develop randomly as previously thought. The Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department at Moffitt use novel approaches and techniques to study cancer. Their researchers developed a mathematical model based on evolutionary theories to show differences in subpopulations of tumors. Similar to all living organisms, their model is based on the evolutionary concept that cancer cells can invest resources in reproduction or the ability to survive, but not both. Using this model, they discovered that cancer cells at the edge of a tumor that are close to the surrounding environment are predictably different from the cells within the interior of the tumor. Cells at the edge of a tumor invest their limited resources into cellular characteristics that promote invasion and the ability to use resources from the surrounding environment, such as blood vessels. Exterior cells develop these characteristics despite their association with a higher risk of cell death. Alternatively, cells within the interior of a tumor are surrounded by many other cells and are farther away from the resources present within the environment.  Therefore, interior cells develop characteristics that allow them to compete with neighboring cells for the limited resources that are available to them. The researchers confirmed these data by showing that cells within the interior and exterior of breast cancer tissue display distinct gene expression patterns. Cells within the interior of a tumor have characteristics that are more static, including less proliferation and more cell death. Alternatively, the cells around the exterior of a tumor have higher rates of proliferation and are more likely to be producing an acidic environment, which is consistent with the need for cells on the edge of a tumor to grow and invade into the surrounding normal tissue.  Interestingly, differences within a single population are seen in biological invasions in nature. For example, the cane toad has been invading Australia for many years. The cane toads at the edge of the invasion have bigger legs presumably because they are adapted to moving farther and faster,  said Robert A. Gatenby, M.D., senior member and chair of the Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology at Moffitt.  However, the characteristics of the invading cane toads that have allowed them to move farther and faster also come with a price:  severe spinal arthritis is found in 10% of the larger-legged toads,  explained Gatenby.

Mosquito bites are not just annoying   they are key for how these viruses spread around your body and cause disease,  said Dr Clive McKimmie, a research fellow at the School of Medicine and senior author of the study.  We now want to look at whether medications such as anti-inflammatory creams can stop the virus establishing an infection if used quickly enough after the bite inflammation appears.  In the new research, published in the journal Immunity, the researchers used mouse models to study the bites of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the species that spreads infections such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya. When a mosquito bites, it injects saliva into the skin. The saliva triggers an immune response in which white blood cells called neutrophils and myeloid cells rush to the site. But instead of helping, some of these cells get infected and inadvertently replicate the virus, the researchers found. The team injected viruses into the skin of the mice with or without the presence of a mosquito bite at the injection site and compared the reaction. In the absence of mosquito bites and their accompanying inflammation, the viruses failed to replicate well, whereas the presence of a bite resulted in a high virus level in the skin.  This was a big surprise we didn t expect,  said Dr McKimmie, whose team worked alongside colleagues at the University of Glasgow.  These viruses are not known for infecting immune cells.  And sure enough, when we stopped these immune cells coming in, the bite did not enhance the infection anymore.  Despite the enormous disease burden of mosquito-borne viral infections   they are responsible for hundreds of millions of cases across the world   there are few specific therapies or vaccines.  This research could be the first step in repurposing commonly available anti-inflammatory drugs to treat bite inflammation before any symptoms set in , said Dr McKimmie, whose study was funded by the Medical Research Council.  We think creams might act as an effective way to stop these viruses before they can cause disease.  He added that if it is proven to be effective, this approach could work against a multitude of other viruses.  Nobody expected Zika, and before that nobody expected Chikungunya,  he said.  There are estimated to be hundreds of other mosquito-borne viruses out there and it s hard to predict what s going to start the next outbreak. ","Published: June 22, 2016"

The Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involves healthy male or female adults aged 18 - 49 years. It will evaluate the efficacy of intramuscular administration of Takeda s norovirus vaccine candidate against moderate or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to norovirus, a common intestinal infection marked by watery diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, nausea and sometimes fever that may lead to clinically significant dehydration. Norovirus is recognized as the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis across the age spectrum. It is estimated that norovirus causes nearly 700 million cases of illness with significant morbidity and social burden worldwide. More than 200,000 deaths per year are estimated to result from norovirus illness, primarily in low-income countries.  We are excited to be on the frontline of development of a vaccine against norovirus,  said Rajeev Venkayya, MD, President of Takeda Vaccines.  The progress of our norovirus program, along with our efforts in dengue, polio and hand foot and mouth disease, demonstrates our commitment to tackling important infectious diseases that affect populations everywhere.  The vaccine candidate uses virus-like particle (VLP) antigens, which are proteins that precisely mimic the outer surface of norovirus. The vaccine includes antigens from genotypes GI.1 and GII.4, to represent both of the genogroups that cause the majority of human illness. Virus-like particle vaccines against human papilloma virus and hepatitis B virus have been licensed by major regulatory bodies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Results from Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of Takeda s norovirus vaccine candidate showed the vaccine is generally well-tolerated and was associated with a reduction in disease symptoms and severity in a human challenge study, which evaluated healthy adults  responses following exposure to live norovirus.   Together with our collaborators, Takeda has dedicated a substantial scientific effort to understand the best ways to prevent norovirus illness through vaccination,  said Robert Goodwin, PhD., Vice President and Global Norovirus Program Head for Takeda Vaccines.  This trial moves us one step closer to putting an important tool for prevention in the hands of individuals, families and public health systems around the globe. ","Published: June 22, 2016"

Around 20 percent of adults diagnosed with leukemia suffer from this type of blood cancer. The protein Gab2 works as an enhancer of cancer-causing signals and is often present in larger quantities in CML cells than in healthy cells. In two studies, Freiburg researchers have made new discoveries concerning the relationship between CML and Gab2 and drugs that can break a particular resistance to Gab2 in CML cells. The team, including Dr. Tilman Brummer, Prof. Dr. J rn Dengjel, Dr. Konrad Aumann, and Dr. Sebastian Halbach, published its findings in the journals Leukemia and Cell Communication and Signaling. Dr. Gabriele Kr ner, managing director of the Jos  Carreras Leukemia Foundation, is delighted with the results:  Research means progress in the battle against diseases. Supporting innovative research projects like this is one of our main objectives at the nonprofit Jos  Carreras Leukemia Foundation. The 200,000 euros in funding the Jos  Carreras Leukemia Foundation contributed to the project was therefore a good use of donations.  The protein Gab2 works like a multi-outlet power strip for proteins in a chain of signals: It can pass on a signal it receives to several enzymes at once and can also amplify the signal. When a large amount of Gab2 is present, it often develops cancer-causing properties. In CML cells, Gab2 amplifies the signal of the protein Bcr-Abl. This protein causes certain cells in the bone marrow and in the blood to grow uncontrollably, thus allowing the cancer to spread more rapidly. An approach often used in treating CML is to block the Bcr-Abl activity using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Yet even when this targeted therapy is successful, it is not possible to kill off all of the diseased cells   particularly the leukemia stem cells in the bone marrow. Lifelong treatment is necessary to keep the disease under control. Many leukemias acquire a resistance to the TKIs used for the therapy over time, and the patient suffers a relapse. To make matters worse, there are also forms of primary resistance in which the leukemia cells react insufficiently to certain TKIs from the outset. The primary and acquired resistances are a major stumbling block in the treatment of CML that is still only poorly understood.  The Freiburg team demonstrated that the drugs sorafenib and axitinib, which are currently approved only for kidney and liver cancer, are effective in CML model systems as well. In experiments on cell cultures, both of these inhibitors succeeded in breaking various forms of the TKI resistance: including forms caused by additional mutations of the gene Bcr-Abl as well as those caused by large quantities of the protein Gab2. Hence, both of the drugs could serve as alternatives for treating CML   especially in patients who have developed a resistance to the medication they have been receiving so far. In addition, the researchers provided evidence that Gab2 plays an important part in the development and spread of CML. In a mouse model in which they simulated the development of CML by adding Bcr-Abl to the bone marrow, a shortage of Gab2 led to a clear weakening or even a lack of symptoms. This shows that Gab2 is crucial for the development and spread of the disease. In the future, doctors could thus use Gab2 as a biomarker and infer the course of the disease by measuring Gab2 levels. In addition, Gab2 could serve as a new therapeutic target in the treatment of CML.

The ZIP family consists of thousands of zinc/iron transporter proteins, and this work represents the first-ever structural information of the ZIP family at the atomic level. The results are published in the current issue of Nature Communications and provide a roadmap for potential target sites for people suffering from acrodermitis enteropathica, a rare but lethal genetic disorder leading to severe zinc deficiency, and pancreatic cancer where ZIP4 is abnormally overexpressed.  Many drug candidates fail during development because their targets are buried inside the cell,  said Jian Hu, assistant professor in MSU s chemistry department.  With ZIP4, though, the large ECD is fully exposed to the extracellular space and quite accessible.  Hu revealed that ZIP4-ECD acts as a critical accessory domain that is essential for optimal zinc transport. Therefore, targeting it appears to be a promising strategy regulating the function of ZIP4. The study also revealed that many human ZIP proteins share a common architecture in their ECDs. This sheds light on structural and functional studies of other ZIP proteins involved in a variety of cancers, osteoarthritis and other serious diseases. Thanks to Hu s lab, scientists now have a research foundation on which to further study zinc transport mechanism of ZIP proteins. Hu was drawn to study zinc and other trace elements because they are essential for life, and zinc is the second most-common trace element behind iron. He focuses on deciphering how the body maintains proper levels. He also dedicates his efforts to exploring what happens when amounts of trace elements rise to toxic levels.  For example, for patients suffering from diseases like Alzheimer s or Parkinson s, the levels of transition metals, particularly zinc and iron, in their brains are significantly higher than those of healthy people,  Hu said.  My laboratory is interested in revealing a better understanding of the body s system of properly handling these trace elements. ","Published: June 22, 2016"

For University of Washington Institute of Protein Design scientists working to invent molecular tools, vehicles, and devices for medicine and other fields, the icosahedron s geometry is inspiring. Its bird cage-like symmetry and spacious interior suggest cargo-containing possibilities.  The protein designers took their cue from the many viruses that, en route to living cells, transport their genomes inside protective icosahedral protein shells.  These delivery packages, termed viral capsids, are formed to be tough enough to withstand the trip, efficiently use storage room, and break apart to release their contents when conditions are right.   The researchers  paper in the scientific journal Nature reports on their computational design and experimental testing of a highly stable icosahedral protein nano-cage.  Engineered at the atomic level, this nano-cage can construct itself from biochemical building blocks and information encoded in strands of DNA. After selecting the design for this icosahedral nano-cage through computer modeling, the researchers produced it in bacteria.  Electron microscopy of the resulting icosahedral particles confirmed that they were nearly identical to the design model. The leads on the project were Yang Hsia, a University of Washington graduate student in biological physics, structure and design, and Jacob B. Bale, a recent graduate from the UW molecular and cellular biology Ph.D. program, and now a research scientist at Arzeda Corporation in Seattle.  The senior authors were Neil P. King, translational investigator at the UW Institute for Protein Design, and David Baker, director of the Institute and UW professor of biochemistry.  Baker is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  The ability to design proteins that self-assemble into precisely specified, robust, and highly order icosahedral structures,  the researchers wrote,  would open the door to a new generation of protein containers with properties custom-made for applications of interest.  Among these applications might be fabricating nanoscale icosahedral vehicles.  Such research might create tiny, spacecraft-like devices that could encapsulate and deliver therapies directly to specific types of cells, such as cancer cells. The designed icosahedron, while sturdy, proved to disassemble and reassemble itself under certain environmental conditions.  This reversible property is essential if it eventually becomes part of packaging, carrying and delivering a biochemical payload. In addition, the flexibility to modify these miniature cages, the researchers said,  should have considerable utility for targeted drug delivery, vaccine design and synthetic biology.  The newly designed icosahedron has considerably larger internal volume than previously designed nano-cages of other shapes, and so could hold more cargo as molecular shipping containers. Working towards that end, the researchers were able to design barriers for the center of each of the twenty faces of the icosahedron.  These could block molecules from entering and leaving the cage.  In future iterations, gated cages might be filled to carry a medication into particular kinds of cell and then discharge it.   Moreover, the protein building blocks making up the cage retain their natural enzymatic activity, which is the ability to speed up chemical reactions. This suggests the possibility of custom designing them as nano-reactors to catalyze specific biochemical processes.  The nano-cages were, in addition, amenable to genetic fusions to enhance their properties.  For example, the researchers created standard candles for light microscopy by adding a fluorescent protein to each of the 60 subunits that frame the icosahedron. The fluorescent intensity was proportional to the number of these proteins attached to each subunit.  The distinctive shape of the icosahedron makes it a readily spotted marker.","Published: June 22, 2016"

The study is opening in Puerto Rico and will expand to several locations in Brazil, Colombia and other areas that are experiencing active local transmission of the virus. Zika virus is spread primarily through bites from infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, although other forms of transmission   notably, mother-to-child and sexual transmission   also occur. Active virus transmission currently is ongoing in 60 countries and territories. The virus has been linked to a spike in cases of microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and possible neurological damage, sparking international concern. In addition to microcephaly, other problems have been detected in pregnancies and among fetuses and infants infected with Zika virus before birth, including miscarriage, stillbirth, absent or poorly developed brain structures, eye defects, hearing deficits, and impaired growth. The Zika in Infants and Pregnancy (ZIP) study aims to enroll as many as 10,000 pregnant women ages 15 years and older at up to 15 sites. The participants will be in their first trimester of pregnancy and will be followed throughout their pregnancies to determine if they become infected with Zika virus and if so, what outcomes result for both mother and child. The participants  infants will be carefully followed for at least one year after birth. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), all part of the NIH, are funding and conducting the study, along with Fiocruz.  The full scope of the effect of Zika virus in pregnancy has not yet been fully determined,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  This large prospective study promises to provide important new data that will help guide the medical and public health responses to the Zika virus epidemic.   Zika virus has spread rapidly through the Americas,  said NICHD Acting Director Catherine Y. Spong, M.D.  We anticipate that this study will provide important information on the link between Zika infection and pregnancy complications and inform strategies to help safeguard the health of mothers and their newborns.   A mother s environment may be an important part of the Zika virus puzzle,  said NIEHS Director Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D.  We ve included environmental measures in the study and will also be evaluating nutrition and socio-economic status.  The researchers plan to compare birth outcomes between mothers who were infected with Zika virus and those who were not, documenting the frequency of miscarriage, preterm birth, microcephaly, malformations of the nervous system, and other complications. The researchers also seek to compare the risk of pregnancy complications among women who have symptoms of Zika virus infection and those who are infected but do not have symptoms. Additionally, the study will evaluate how the timing of infection affects pregnancy outcomes and the role environmental influences, social determinants and other infections, such as dengue virus infection, may play on the health of the study participants and their newborns. Women participating in the ZIP study will be monitored monthly for the duration of their pregnancies and then six weeks after delivery. They will have a physical examination and be asked to provide blood, urine, saliva and vaginal swab samples at study entry and at each monthly prenatal care visit. If the participants note that they will be receiving an amniocentesis in connection with their clinical care, the research team will arrange with the participant and her obstetrician to obtain a sample of the amniotic fluid to test for Zika infection. The participants will be instructed about the signs and symptoms of acute Zika virus infection and will be asked to notify their clinic immediately if they experience symptoms. Post-delivery, a breast milk sample, if available, will be obtained for Zika testing. Infants whose mothers consent to their participation in the study will be evaluated within 48 hours of birth and again at three, six and 12 months.  This study, in partnership with NIH, is essential to elucidating the scientific complexity of the Zika virus,  said Fiocruz President Paulo Gadelha.  It will be fundamental to developing prevention and treatment strategies against the disease.  It is important to note that the ZIP study is a research effort that is distinct from and complementary to public health registries underway in the United States (U.S. Zika Public Health Registry), Puerto Rico (Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System), and Colombia (SIVIGILA/Projecto Vez). These registries are population-based and collect observations from medical evaluations and testing with the intent of providing information for public health action.

As part of the collaboration, IBM will augment the existing research capacity at the Cumming School of Medicine s Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute by installing a POWER8-based computing and storage infrastructure along with advanced analytics and cognitive computing software. Researchers have investigated hundreds of genetic cases at the Alberta Children s Hospital, contributing to the identification of 30 new genes. However, one in four children admitted to the Alberta Children s Hospital has an unknown or undiagnosed illness. With access to these new tools, scientists can better generate, store and analyze complex clinical, genetic and imaging data, and expect to reduce from months to days the cycle times required for investigations into how genes and environmental factors impact child health. This precision-medicine approach will lead to opportunities for better diagnostics, prevention and more personalized treatment protocols.  Advances in our ability to capture and analyze data have truly cross-cutting affects for research programs throughout the university, says Ed McCauley, vice-president (research), University of Calgary.  This collaboration will not only allow researchers to sort through larger data sets and provide advanced skill development opportunities for our trainees, it will increase capacity for genomics work in Calgary.  The initiative will support three projects including the work of Dr. Micheil Innes, a member of the Department of Medical Genetics as the Cumming School of Medicine. Dr. Innes is researching more rapid and accurate diagnosis of genetic disorders and through his work was able to help a Calgary teenager who was diagnosed with a rare form of autism. Genomic medicine promises to revolutionize biomedical research and clinical care, enabling scientists to identify individuals at risk, provide early diagnoses based on biomarkers, and recommend effective treatments. But the field of genomics has been caught in a flood of data that often outpaces the ability to quickly store, analyze, share, and archive it, creating an obstacle to discovery. The new technology platform at ACHRI is designed to specifically address these challenges.  IBM has always believed investment in research and development is an important driver for Canada s competitiveness, and few fields offer greater opportunities for innovation than healthcare,  says Dino Trevisani, president of IBM Canada.  Improving the health and vitality of our children requires collaboration across government, social programs, life sciences, health researchers and providers.

In the new project, called PERFORM, the team will build on previous research that showed bacterial illnesses can be identified by a particular patterns of genes and proteins. Mike Levin, Professor of International Child Health at Imperial College London, who leads the new project explained:  Rather than attempting to identify the bacteria, which has been the focus of most previous tests for bacterial infection, we believe bacterial infection can be recognised by the pattern of genes and proteins activated by the child s immune system in response to the infection. During the five-year project the team will study around 60,000 children across Europe and West Africa who arrive at hospitals and clinics with a high fever. At the moment, when a child arrives at a surgery or hospital with fever, doctors have no quick method of distinguishing whether the child is suffering from bacterial or viral illness. Diagnosis relies instead on taking a sample of blood or spinal fluid, and seeing if bacteria grow in this sample. However this can take more than 48 hours. Differentiating between viruses and bacteria is crucially important. Although viral infections are much more common than bacterial infections, the latter are far more dangerous, and lead to a deadly conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia. Therefore as a precaution, doctors often give antibiotics immediately to children with high fever   before the test results are available to confirm whether the child is suffering from a bacterial or viral infection. Professor Levin added:  Fever is one of the most common reasons children are brought to medical care. While most episodes of high fever in children are due to a viral illness   which will often get better on its own - hidden amongst them are life-threatening bacterial infections. Our current methods do not allow doctors to reliably distinguish between life-threatening bacterial infection and trivial viral illness. As a result, thousands of children each day worldwide undergo investigations such as lumbar puncture, x-rays and blood tests and are treated with antibiotics while awaiting the results of investigations to rule out bacterial infection. Antibiotics are powerless against viral infections, but because there is no reliable method to distinguish the rare cases of bacterial infection from the many children with viral infections, many receive unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. This frequent, unnecessary, use of antibiotics for common viral infections, contributes to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. A recent Government report warned antibiotic resistance would kill one person every three seconds by 2050. Professor Levin added:  Lack of an accurate, reliable and rapid test to distinguish bacterial infections from the vastly more common viral infections is a major factor leading to widespread prescription of antibiotics in both hospitals and in the community. Indeed, the Government s O Neill report recently highlighted the urgent need for the development of these rapid tests. Furthermore, the lack of a quick test to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections mean some potentially dangerous bacterial infections can be missed, explained Professor Levin:  Every year many children are sent away from Accident & Emergency departments or GP surgeries because the medical team thinks they have a viral infection, when in fact they are suffering from life-threatening bacterial infections - which are only diagnosed too late. During the five year project, funded by the European Commission s Horizon 2020 programme, the international team will study around 60,000 children who arrive at hospitals across Europe and West Africa with fever. The team includes groups from Oxford, Liverpool, Newcastle, Spain, Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Greece, Slovenia, Latvia , the Gambia and Switzerland, as well as the biotechnology companies Micropathology Ltd UK and bioM rieux, France. Federico Martin n-Torres, Professor of Paediatrics from the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain who leads the clinical recruitment programme said:  The PERFORM research programme will build on previous successful collaboration between paediatricians and scientists across Europe. The large numbers of children with infection that we need to study can only be achieved through collaboration across Europe. By joining efforts in recruiting patients to research studies and linking the powerful new genetic and proteomic research methods available across Europe our progamme will make a major contribution to one of the world s most important problems   the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance .

The work, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is published online in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. These findings are a secondary result from the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) clinical trial, which was conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network and led by researchers at King s College London. Primary results from the LEAP trial, published in 2015, showed that introducing peanut products into the diets of infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy led to an 81 percent relative reduction in subsequent development of the allergy compared to avoiding peanut altogether. The goal of the current analysis was to determine whether eating high doses of peanut products beginning in infancy would have any adverse effects on infant and child growth and nutrition.  The striking finding that early inclusion of peanut products in the diet reduces later development of allergy already is beginning to transform how clinicians approach peanut allergy prevention,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  The new results provide reassurance that early-life peanut consumption has no negative effect on children s growth and nutrition. At the beginning of the LEAP trial, investigators randomly assigned 640 infants aged 4 to 11 months living in the United Kingdom to regularly consume at least 2 grams of peanut protein three times per week or to avoid peanut entirely. These regimens were continued until the children were 5 years old. The researchers monitored the children at recurring health care visits, and asked their parents and caregivers to complete dietary questionnaires and food diaries. In the current analysis, investigators compared the growth, nutrition and diets of the LEAP peanut consumers and avoiders. Many of the participants were breastfeeding at the beginning of LEAP.  An important and reassuring finding was that peanut consumption did not affect the duration of breastfeeding, thus countering concerns that introduction of solid foods before six months of age could reduce breastfeeding duration,  said lead author Mary Feeney, M.Sc., R.D., of King s College London. In addition, the researchers did not observe differences in height, weight or body mass index   a measure of healthy weight status   between the peanut consumers and avoiders at any point during the study. This was true even when the researchers compared the subgroup of children who consumed the greatest amount of peanut protein with those who avoided peanut entirely. In general, the peanut consumers easily achieved the recommended level of 6 grams of peanut protein per week, consuming 7.5 grams weekly on average. They made some different food choices than the avoiders, investigators noted. For example, consumers are fewer chips and savory snacks. Both groups had similar total energy intakes from food and comparable protein intakes, although the peanut consumers had higher fat intakes and avoiders had higher carbohydrate intakes.  Overall, these findings indicate that early-life introduction of peanut-containing foods as a strategy to prevent the subsequent development of peanut allergy is both feasible and nutritionally safe, even at high levels of peanut consumption,  said Marshall Plaut, M.D., chief of the Food Allergy, Atopic Dermatitis and Allergic Mechanisms Section in NIAID s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation, and a co-author of the paper.

The four-year IDentIFY project brings together the complementary expertise of universities and research centers in U.K, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland. It is coordinated by the University of Aberdeen in Scotland U.K. The French IDentIFY partners are CEA (led by Leti, a CEA Tech institute, and Inac), INSERM, and G2ELab. The project, which is part of the EU Horizon 2020 program, was initiated by INSERM. It aims to further develop and help commercialize a characterization technique, called Fast Field-Cycling (FFC) MRI to obtain quantitative, disease related information that is invisible to standard MRI. Unlike standard MRI, in which scanners operate at a strong, fixed magnetic field, FFC-MRI scanners pioneered by the University of Aberdeen yield images of living organisms at varying low values of the magnetic field by fast switching of this field from high to near-zero values. This technique can deliver a wealth of unprecedented medical information at a lower cost than conventional MRI.  This technology presents a huge opportunity to cost-effectively improve health care, especially for cancer, one of the world s fastest-growing diseases,  said Marie Semeria, CEO of Leti, a CEA Tech institute.  The three Grenoble-based partners in the IDentIFY project are a strong testament to the area s concentration of expertise in health care and advanced magnetism technology, and its many applications.  Previous work on Fast-Field Cycling MRI at Aberdeen has shown it can have a major impact on the diagnosis and treatment of serious diseases. In fact, pilot studies have demonstrated the technology s ability to detect cancer, osteoarthritis and sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength as part of the aging process. With cancer, FFC-MRI will enable tumor grading, treatment planning and monitoring of the response to chemotherapy, and especially the characterization of peritumoral regions. In addition, Fast Field-Cycling MRI has the potential to detect early changes in the brain caused by neurodegenerative disease processes. This may enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For over 50 years, following the French physicist Louis N el (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1970), the Grenoble region has been recognized as a global leader in research and development of magnetism for advanced technological purposes. This expertise eventually resulted in a very accurate control of static and time-dependent low and ultra-low magnetic fields, which is a key challenge for FFC-MRI to work efficiently. For that purpose, precise measurements, mathematical modeling and real-time magnetic shielding will be implemented for the FFC NMR/MRI devices, thanks to the shared know-how of the G2ELab laboratory and Leti, which are working closely together on this ambitious project. The contributions of the Grenoble participants to the IDentIFY project are:  CNRS/UGA/Grenoble INP: Environmental field measurement and modelling  Leti: Development of magnetic field correction coils and their associated electronics INSERM: MRI methodology, tissue-bank testing and validation Inac: Decades of experience in FFC-NMR relaxometry methods and measurements and the information that can be extracted from them through theoretical modelling.

How these early mammals evolved night vision to find food and survive has been a mystery, but a new study published in Developmental Cell suggests that rods in the mammalian eye, extremely sensitive to light, developed from color-detecting cone cells during this time to give mammals an edge in low-light conditions. See Also: Bug eyes: Tiny glasses confirm 3D vision in insects Cone cells are specialized for certain wavelengths of light to help animals detect color, while rods can detect even a single photon and are specialized for low-light vision. ""The majority of mammals have rod-dominant retinas, but if you look at fish, frogs, or birds, the vast majority are cone-dominated so the evolutionary question has always been, 'What happened?'"" says Anand Swaroop, a retina biologist at the National Eye Institute (U.S.), part of the National Institutes of Health. ""We've been working for a long time to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind rod and cone development."" Previous work done by Swaroop and his colleagues showed that a transcription factor called NRL pushes cells in the retina toward maturing into rods by suppressing genes involved in cone development. ""We began to wonder if, somehow, the short-wavelength cones were converted into rods during evolution,"" says Swaroop. Cone photoreceptors (green) in a slice from a mouse retina. A majority of the photoreceptors (97%) in the retina are rods (black). Black top layer is the retinal pigment epithelium. Credit: Jung-Woong Kim  To investigate the origin of rods in mammals, Swaroop and his team examined rod and cone cells taken from mice at different stages of development. Details of an organism's embryonic development often reveal traits carried by its evolutionary ancestors; consider, for instance, how human embryos initially develop gill-like slits and a tail. The researchers saw that in early stages, two days after the mice were born, developing rod cells expressed genes normally seen in mature short-wavelength cones (which are used in other animals to detect ultraviolet light). When the researchers examined the epigenetics of purified rod cells from mice, they saw that these aspects became repressed by histone and DNA methylations later in development, ten days after the mice were born. In zebrafish, which are diurnal and cone-dominated, another set of experiments showed that the rod cells didn't resemble cones at all. To investigate when the mammalian elements that turn cones to rods might have originated, the researchers reviewed genomic sequences from a variety of vertebrate animals. The team discovered that the genes responsible for the regulation of NRL became more refined in the placental mammals as the modern retina evolved and were lost in several non-mammalian groups. The origin of this regulatory system appeared to coincide with the evolution of nocturnality in early mammals. Learn More: A new system for color visionThe team concluded that in mammals, the transcription factor NRL became restricted to the photoreceptors in the eye, forcing the cells to change from cones to rods and giving early mammals the edge they needed to take up an active nighttime lifestyle. (Counter-intuitively, humans depend more on cones for our vision, but that's because our ancestors later evolved to take advantage of the daylight hours again). ""These rod photoreceptors retain the molecular footprint of short-wavelength cones,"" says Swaroop. ""We've provided evidence that by acquiring the regulatory elements for NRL to shift short-wavelength cones into rods, early mammals changed one type of cell from capturing UV light which isn't necessary at night to something that is just extremely sensitive to light.""

The team says its study, described in Neurology: Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation, demonstrates that using computers to rapidly analyze huge amounts of genetic and biological information could be a cost-effective addition to a pathology lab's toolkit. More than 50 percent of inflammatory disorders and infections of the brain go undiagnosed, which can lead to treatments for individual symptoms that can do more harm than good. See Also: Meningitis model shows infection s sci-fi-worthy creep into the brain ""By incorporating modern genetic sequencing techniques into pathology diagnostics, we were able to investigate the potential presence of infection in 10 subjects and found appropriate explanations of clinical problems in eight out of 10 patient cases examined in this study,"" says Carlos Pardo-Villamizar, MD, associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We hope to develop this technique further as a way to bring the diagnosis rate of inflammatory brain disorders and infections closer to 100 percent so we can treat patients more effectively."" In the study, the researchers first identified 10 people at The Johns Hopkins Hospital   six males and four females between the ages of 16 and 68   with clinical signs of a brain infection, such as fever and rapid onset of neurological symptoms, like weakness in limbs, partial paralysis numbness, headache or seizures. Each patient had a biopsy of a brain lesion (an area of inflamed, damaged tissue) first identified by MRI. Using commercially available genetic sequencing technologies that read millions of pieces of DNA at once, the researchers sequenced the DNA of the brain tissue for each person and compared the results to a database containing human and nonhuman DNA sequences, 2,817 bacterial genomes, 4,383 viral genomes and 26 single-cell pathogen genomes. After subtracting out the human DNA results, they ranked the top three other species found in each sample that were thought to be potential infectious organisms. Don't Miss: Vaccination on the horizon for severe viral infection of the brain In three patients, they said genetic sequencing definitively identified the cause of the infection as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis and sometimes infects the brain; JC virus, which is found in most people but is only typically infectious in people with weakened immune systems; or Epstein-Barr virus, a herpes virus most commonly known to cause mononucleosis in humans. ""Identifying organisms involved in brain infections is critical for establishing adequate treatments and, in the case of tuberculosis or viral infections, is a major challenge in clinical practice,"" says Pardo-Villamizar. The researchers report that genetic sequencing also revealed possible but unspecified infections in two other patients. In one patient, the researchers identified several bacteria species in the biopsy related to Delftia acidovorans, a rare, rod-shaped bacillus that physicians treated with antibiotics. In the other patient, they identified a relatively high number of sequences from Lactococcus, a normally noninfectious bacterium. However, they reanalyzed the sequence data a year later and found the sequences matched up to a newly emerging pathogen, Elizabethkingia a genome that was unavailable during the original analysis. The bacterium, found in soil, has been linked mostly to newborn meningitis or inflammation of the membrane covering the brain. ""One of the limitations of using this kind of diagnostic tool is that we can only identify the pathogens for which we have the genetic sequences available,"" says Steven Salzberg, PhD, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, a professor of biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins and co-author of the study. ""As we continue to sequence the genomes of more organisms, the tool will become steadily more powerful."" The cost for genetic sequencing using the latest technology is less than $500 per sample and takes a couple of days. The comparison of the DNA results to other species takes less than two hours. In five patients, the research team says, the sequencing didn't point to a specific pathogen as a cause. In those cases, negative findings helped clinicians to better understand the diseases those patients were experiencing. Pardo-Villamizar says a key value of the sequencing test is to avoid treating patients with drugs that may do harm. ""If someone has an infection, then you don't necessarily want to give them steroids to reduce inflammation. You'll make the infection worse by knocking down the immune system,"" says Pardo-Villamizar. ""Having a correct diagnosis is the only way to ensure the best, individualized precision treatment."" Learn More: Most Ebola survivors examined in study experienced brain symptoms six months after infection To bring this type of testing into widespread laboratory use, Pardo-Villamizar says more research is needed to establish a baseline of what organisms may be found in normal, healthy brains. They'll also need a larger validation study of patients with an already established diagnosis to determine the rate of false positive or false negative results. The 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that 77,000 people die each year around the world due to brain inflammatory conditions. About 2,000 a year are due to active infections in the U.S. Once the cause is determined, people can be treated with antivirals or antibiotics if an infection is suspected, or steroids if the cause is thought to be autoimmune.

""Our consortium is devoted to uncovering the genetic causes of migraine and during the past few years we have been able to identify many risk variants.

His group's research goal is to bring AFM into the field of medical diagnostics. It is their belief that AFM is the most sensitive tool for detecting various biomarkers without amplification or labelling. Reliability and speed have been past hurdles of AFM, but Professor Park's team has demonstrated that the application of a finely controlled surface coating to AFM probes and substrates overcomes this barrier. Furthermore, recent advances of microscopy technology (in terms of speed) make it more suitable for cost-effective bioanalysis. With a capture spot* fabricated with conventional microarrayers, the limit of detection (LOD) is about 10 fM. This is better than that of most of the current typical bioanalyses such as microarray and ELISA (1 pM). With a capture spot as small as a few microns, the LOD is 10 aM and this can be pushed further with a capture spot as small as 1 micron. The approach has been demonstrated to be good for various biomarkers including protein, DNA, mRNA and microRNA from a single cell. The group believes that AFM can open up a new window for life sciences and medical diagnostics. The laboratory has used AFM systems from multiple vendors over a period of several years. However, now with their second NanoWizard  AFM operating alongside their ForceRobot  system, they believe in JPK's systems. User, Dr Youngkyu Kim, describes his thoughts on the instrumentation.  JPK's AFMs fit well with our objective. They are user-friendly and robust. We have used NanoWizard  I and ForceRobot  for many years without much trouble. We have now added a NanoWizard  3. Also important to us is JPK's attitude towards customers. I am very happy with their kind and close support. They understand our goals and work with us to help reach them. Whenever we encountered any issues with their AFMs in my laboratory, they fixed the problems quickly. Even when I requested new programs to handle our tasks, JPK generated new software routines for us. Over time, I met several of their key staff at conferences like ISPM and used these meetings to discuss pending issues and to get advice as to how to get around difficulties and challenges.  The group publishes quite prolifically. For example, the use of JPK's ForceRobot  300 is highlighted in a paper recently published in Nature Communications:  Cytosolic targeting factor AKR2A captures chloroplast outer membrane-localized client proteins at the ribosome during translation.

An inability to shift between habitual and non-habitual behaviors has been implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), addiction, and other disorders characterized by impaired decision-making. In a new study conducted with mice, scientists report that endocannabinoids, natural messengers in the body that are chemically similar to the active compound in marijuana, play an important role in how the brain controls this fundamental process. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of the National Institutes of Health, funded the study.  The new findings point to a previously unknown mechanism in the brain that regulates the transition between goal-directed and habitual behaviors,  said George F. Koob, Ph.D., NIAAA director.  As we learn more about this mechanism, it could reveal how the brain forms habits and, more specifically, how both endocannabinoids and cannabinoid abuse can influence habitual behavior pathophysiology.  A report of the findings is now online in the journal Neuron. Previous work in NIAAA s Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience suggested that reduced activity in the brain s orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) underlies habit formation. Endocannabinoids are known to generally reduce the activity of neurons. In the current study, the authors, hypothesized that endocannabinoids in the OFC could be playing a key role in habit formation. The researchers used a newly developed procedure that allowed them to probe the brain mechanisms involved when a mouse shifts from goal-directed to habitual actions. By chemically inhibiting the activity of neurons in the OFC, they disrupted goal-directed behaviors and the mice relied on habitual actions instead. David Lovinger, Ph.D., chief of the NIAAA Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience, Rui Costa, Ph.D., D.V.M., from the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal, and first author Christina Gremel, Ph.D. from NIAAA and the University of California, San Diego led the research team.  Mice were trained to receive a food reward in two different ways,  said Dr. Lovinger.  One way required the animal to respond out of habit, while the second way demanded it to perform behaviors that were goal-directed.  When Dr. Lovinger and his colleagues selectively deleted a particular endocannabinoid receptor, called cannabinoid type 1 (CB1), from OFC neurons, they found that mice that lacked these receptors did not form habits, but used goal-directed responses to receive the food reward. Animals with intact CB1 receptors preferentially used habitual responses to obtain the food reward. The authors say the new study points to a molecular mechanism through which endocannabinoids promote the formation of habits by reducing the flow of information in the OFC.  Endocannabinoids appear to act as a brake in the OFC, allowing for habit formation,  said Dr. Gremel, an assistant professor of psychology and affiliated with the Neurosciences Graduate program at UCSD. ""Our results suggest that alterations in the brain s endocannabinoid system could be blocking the brain s capacity to  break habits  as observed in disorders that affect switching between goal-directed and habitual behaviors.  The authors concluded that their findings demonstrate the existence of parallel brain circuits that mediate goal-directed and habitual behaviors. Drugs of abuse and neuropsychiatric disorders can affect decision-making by changing the balance between habitual and goal-directed actions. In particular, these mechanisms could help explain how cannabis drugs such as marijuana affect memory and decision-making. The new findings suggest that strategies that target the brain s endocannabinoid system might restore this balance and alleviate suffering in disorders involving these processes. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the primary U.S. agency for conducting and supporting research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and alcohol problems.

The new company s web-based software platform aims to improve the tele monitoring of patients suffering from heart failure (HF) and cardiac arrhythmia with Cardiac Implanted Electronic Devices (CIED), an estimated total of about 10 million patients worldwide. The collaboration agreement between LindaCare and UZ Leuven was signed earlier this year to enhance the quality of follow-up care through tele-monitoring for patients affected by these type of conditions. After an intense and fruitful collaborative work with well-known implant device vendors   including Medtronic, Biotronik, St Jude Medical and Boston Scientific   LindaCare has provided the hospital and its patients with the first version of its advanced and innovative software. LindaCare started the development of OnePulse  when it realized that the CIED patient follow-up process using tele-monitoring was inefficient and human resource intensive - a potential risk factor in quality of patient care and an obstacle for extending the enrollment of tele-monitored patients. Nurses and physicians are still confronted on a daily basis with the complexity of having to manage a variety of different tele-monitoring systems from several CIED vendors in order to properly follow-up large numbers of patients.  Having OnePulse  v1.0 implemented in our department will bring a major benefit for the tele monitoring of our CIED patients. By unifying the patient alerts and managing their workflow into one single platform, OnePulse  will make the whole telemonitoring process considerably more cost efficient for our teams and more reliable for our patients,  said Prof. Dr. Rik Willems, head of the cardiac electrophysiology unit at UZ Leuven. Thanks to the close involvement and feedback provided by UZ Leuven s cardiology nurses and physicians during OnePulse s software development process, several improvements have already been implemented to the existing functionalities and new features are planned for future software upgrades. OnePulse  has also been successfully integrated with  KWS , the Electronic Health Records (EHR) platform developed by UZ Leuven and deployed over the whole Nexus Health hospital group network.

The new and improved illumigene  Mycoplasma Direct assay, launched earlier this year in Europe, features a simplified 3-step procedure. The new procedure will significantly expand Meridian s customer base by eliminating the need for specialized techniques and training, as well as providing definitive results in less than one hour. Often referred to as  walking pneumonia , M. pneumoniae is associated with up to 40% of community-acquired pneumonias and accounts for approximately two million infections annually in the United States. Due to the lack of cell wall in Mycoplasma, typical antibiotics like penicillin and cephalosporin are not effective. illumigene Mycoplasma Direct accurately detects infection on the first day of symptoms and provides the ability to avoid treating patients empirically to reduce the administration of broad spectrum antibiotics and the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance. The illumigene Mycoplasma Direct test utilizes throat swabs and provides highly sensitive and specific results. It requires no expensive capital equipment or service contracts. The test relies upon a simple 3-step procedure that takes less than two minutes of hands-on time. The simplicity of this technology, along with its cost efficiency and small footprint, makes this innovative test ideal for enabling a more rapid diagnosis; providing earlier identification of outbreaks and prevention of secondary cases though implementation of control measures. Mike Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and President of Meridian Global Diagnostics stated,  As the market share leader for Mycoplasma pneumoniae testing, we are pleased to be able to offer our customers an improved molecular assay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. By simplifying the procedure of illumigene Mycoplasma we are able to address a larger customer base with a superior diagnostic tool that will dramatically improve patient care. Traditional methods of diagnosis include serology and X-Ray which may have as low as 25% and 41% sensitivity respectively, making rapid, targeted detection for specific treatment difficult. Our illumigene molecular platform does not require cumbersome capital equipment or costly hidden service contracts. We believe illumigene is the best value choice for molecular detection in infectious disease.  illumigene Mycoplasma Direct, now available for order immediately in the U.S., adds to the already broad illumigene menu that includes molecular assays for C. difficile, Group A Streptococcus, Group B Streptococcus, HSV 1&2 and Pertussis in the United States as well as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Malaria outside of the U.S.","Published: June 21, 2016"

The results of the National Institutes of Health-funded study were published in Neurology. These findings are part of the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution (DEFUSE)-2 Study, which was designed to see how MRIs can help determine which patients undergo endovascular therapy following ischemic stroke caused by a clot blocking blood flow to the brain. Endovascular treatment targets the ischemic clot itself, either removing it or breaking it up with a stent. The blood-brain barrier is a layer of cells that protects the brain from harmful molecules passing through the bloodstream. After stroke, the barrier is disrupted, becoming permeable and losing control over what gets into the brain.  The biggest impact of this research is that information from MRI scans routinely collected at a number of research hospitals and stroke centers can inform treating physicians on the risk of bleeding,  said Richard Leigh, M.D., a scientist at NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and an author on the study. In this study, brain scans were collected from more than 100 patients before they underwent endovascular therapy, within 12 hours of stroke onset. Dr. Leigh and his team obtained the images from DEFUSE-2 investigators. Using a new method of image processing, Dr. Leigh s group was able to get detailed measurements on the extent to which the blood-brain barrier is disrupted following a stroke. Combining that data with findings from the DEFUSE-2 study revealed that large degrees of blood-brain barrier disruption were associated with severe bleeding following endovascular therapy. Extensive breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was associated with parenchymal hematoma, a form of bleeding in the brain that carries the greatest risk for the patient. In addition, the results showed a link between the location of blood-brain barrier damage and post-treatment brain bleeding. Ischemic stroke patients are increasingly receiving combination therapy, endovascular treatment along with an intravenous drug known as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), to effectively break up clots in the brain. However, bleeding into the damaged brain tissue is a serious complication of both acute stroke therapies. t-PA has been shown to be most effective when given within a few hours of stroke onset, but the treatment window for endovascular therapy is unknown.  With the growing precision of brain imaging technology, researchers are able to get a detailed look at what is going on in the brain during a stroke. Innovative studies, such as DEFUSE-2, can help patients and their doctors make more informed decisions about medical care,  said Walter Koroshetz, M.D., director of NINDS. According to the authors, examining blood-brain barrier disruption on brain images may potentially help doctors identify patients not likely to benefit from endovascular therapy.  It is too early to say how these images will be able to help guide clinical decisions, but they can expand how we think about stroke, especially as we try to broaden treatment options for this disease that can have devastating consequences,  said Dr. Leigh. The DEFUSE-3 trial is currently underway, in which researchers will use imaging data to select patients for endovascular therapy up to 16 hours after stroke onset. The patients  recovery will be closely monitored for three months following the treatment. This study was supported by the NIH (NS039325, NS051372, NIH Intramural Program). The NINDS is the nation s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.","Published: June 21, 2016"

Compared with unexposed children, those who were prenatally exposed to cannabis had a thicker prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in complex cognition, decision-making, and working memory. See Also: Antidepressants during pregnancy linked to preterm birth Author of the study Dr. Hanan El Marroun, of Erasmus University Medical Center in The Netherlands, said: ""this study is important because cannabis use during pregnancy is relatively common and we know very little about the potential consequences of cannabis exposure during pregnancy and brain development later in life."" An estimated 2-13% of women worldwide use cannabis during pregnancy. Previous studies have identified short and long-term behavioral consequences of prenatal cannabis exposure, but effects on brain morphology were unknown. ""Understanding what happens in the brain may give us insights in how children develop after being exposed to cannabis,"" said El Marroun. In the recently published study, the researchers used structural magnetic resonance imaging to examine the brains of 54 children, 6 to 8 years old, who were prenatally exposed to cannabis. Most of the children exposed to cannabis were also exposed to tobacco, so the researchers compared them to 96 children prenatally exposed to tobacco only, as well as to 113 control children with no exposure. The children were part of a prospective population-based study in The Netherlands. Comparing tobacco-exposed children with children exposed to both tobacco and cannabis revealed differences in the cortical thickness, suggesting that cannabis exposure has different effects than tobacco. No differences were found in overall brain volume in the cannabis-exposed children.

The discovery could shed light on the development of meningiomas, tumors arising from the brain and spinal cord that are usually not cancerous but that can require risky surgery and affect a patient's quality of life. See Also: Scientists find way to disrupt brain tumor stem cells Because previous research had established that the slow-growing tumors are more common among people who are obese and those who have diabetes, researchers led by The Ohio State University's Judith Schwartzbaum set out to look for a relationship between meningiomas and blood markers, including glucose. After all, high blood sugar is a component of diabetes and a precursor to its development. Furthermore, Type 2 diabetes and obesity are closely linked. But when they compared blood tests in a group of more than 41,000 Swedes with meningioma diagnoses 15 or fewer years later, they found that high blood sugar, particularly in women, actually meant the person was less likely to face a brain tumor diagnosis. ""It's so unexpected. Usually diabetes and high blood sugar raises the risk of cancer, and it's the opposite here,"" said Schwartzbaum, an associate professor of epidemiology and a researcher in Ohio State's Comprehensive Cancer Center. The work appears in the British Journal of Cancer. ""It should lead to a better understanding of what's causing these tumors and what can be done to prevent them."" Though meningiomas are rarely cancerous, they behave in a similar way, leading scientists to wonder if some relationships between possible risk factors and tumor development would be similar, Schwartzbaum said. Don't Miss: Brain tumor cells penetrated by tiny, degradable particles carrying genetic instructions The researchers, looking at data collected from 1985 to 2012, identified 296 cases of meningioma, more than 61 percent of them in women. Women with the highest fasting blood sugar were less than half as likely as those with the lowest readings to develop a tumor. The relationship was not statistically significant when researchers looked at men's fasting sugar readings and tumor development. But when they compared the less-reliable non-fasting sugar readings (those taken without a period of no food or drink that could influence the results), they found that both men and women with high blood sugar had a lower likelihood of meningioma diagnosis. A diabetes diagnosis before meningioma also appeared to decrease the risk of this tumor, although Schwartzbaum said the data likely had incomplete information on diabetes. The results could lead to a clearer explanation of how the tumors develop and grow and could potentially start researchers down the road to improved diagnostic techniques, Schwartzbaum said. ""These tumors take years to develop, and an earlier diagnosis would certainly lead to better surgical outcomes,"" she said. About seven in 100,000 U.S. residents receive a meningioma diagnosis annually. Meningiomas can cause headaches, weakness in the limbs, seizures, vision problems and personality changes. They represent about a third of all tumors that originate in the brain, according to the American Brain Tumor Association. Possible explanations for the relationship could be found by closer examination of the role of sex hormones and the interplay between glucose levels and those hormones, Schwartzbaum said. It's also possible that sugar levels dip during early tumor development because the tumor is using glucose to grow, she said. Learn More: Laser-based imaging tool could increase accuracy, safety of brain tumor surgery ""There are so many things still to be learned, but I am glad that people are now serious about studying these so-called benign tumors,"" Schwartzbaum said.

The overall approach appears applicable to several other tissue types, including skin and the linings of the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts.  This new methodology opens up new avenues for research in any airway disease, such as asthma or COPD,  says Jayaraj Rajagopal, MD, of the MGH Center for Regenerative Medicine and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, senior author of the report.  While in the past we could only expand stem cells for a few generations, now we have the ability to generate enough cells to last multiple laboratories for years of experiments. Our system is also very simple, avoiding the complexities of former culture systems and making it more accessible to many labs.  Many hypotheses had been suggested to explain the limited ability to maintain stem cells in culture   including a loss of the telomeres that protect the end of chromosomes and cellular senescence, a form of aging that puts a halt to growth. Rajagopal s team focused on a cellular signaling pathway known to regulate cell growth and the critical process of differentiation, in which cells become more specialized and lose their ability to give rise to other types of cells. Activated by proteins such as TGF-  and bone morphogenic protein (BMP), the pathway transmits signals to the nucleus by means of intracellular proteins called SMADs. The researchers investigated whether inhibiting SMAD pathways could foster the expansion of cultured adult stem cells by preventing differentiating. In a series of experiments, they first confirmed that both TGF- /BMP and SMAD signaling were active in differentiated cells but not in adult stem cells. After showing that blocking SMAD signaling could prevent the differentiation of airway stem cells from mice, they found that blocking both TGF-  and BMP pathways allowed the expansion of many generations of airway stem cells. They were able to generate human airway stem cells from samples taken during bronchoscopy, a procedure routinely used for diagnosing or monitoring airway disorders. Remarkably, the investigators were also successful in generating and maintain airway stem cells from some samples of sputum, the fluid expelled from the respiratory tract during a cough.  If we could find ways to induce cough samples containing larger numbers of stem cells, our technique would represent the least invasive way to obtain any stem cell from any organ, and if we could improve the procedure to yield stem cell cultures from 100 percent of sputum samples, we could acquire samples to study lung disease in the laboratory with less invasiveness than a blood draw,  says Rajagopal.   We also found that the same methodology works for many tissues of the body   from the skin to the esophagus to mammary glands. Many of these organ tissues cannot currently be cultured, so it remains to be seen whether scientists in these areas will be able to grow stem cells from samples acquired from other minimally invasive procedures, including the collection of secretions. If all this becomes possible, it would represent a big step forward for personalized medical approaches to disease,  he says. An associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Rajagopal elaborates that the ability to maintain and expand populations of adult stem cells will improve the modeling of disease processes, allow screening of potential therapeutic drugs with cells derived from individual patients, and enable the creation of human  knockout/knockin  cellular models using the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology.  In many diseases   lung diseases in particular   the mouse is a very poor model of human disease, so this ability really opens up new horizons to apply human genetics to human lung cells and disease models.  He adds that this technology should improve the safety of stem-cell-based therapies by removing the risk of contaminants introduced by mouse cells that are traditionally used to support airway stem cells in culture. While the new procedure maintains the function of adult stem cells through many generations, eventually they do begin to deteriorate, which makes reducing or even eliminating this loss of function is an important next goal.

Since DNA is at the root of many disease processes, the technique could help scientists gain important insights into what goes wrong when DNA becomes damaged or when other cellular processes affect gene expression. The new imaging method builds on a technique called single-molecule microscopy by adding information about the orientation and movement of fluorescent dyes attached to the DNA strand. W. E. Moerner, Stanford University, USA, is the founder of single-molecule spectroscopy, a breakthrough method from 1989 that allowed scientists to visualize single molecules with optical microscopy for the first time. Of the 2014 Nobel Laureates for optical microscopy beyond the diffraction limit (Moerner, Hell & Betzig), Moerner and Betzig used single molecules to image a dense array of molecules at different times. In The Optical Society's journal for high impact research, Optica, the research team led by Moerner describes their new technique and demonstrates it by obtaining super-resolution images and orientation measurements for thousands of single fluorescent dye molecules attached to DNA strands.  You can think of these new measurements as providing little double-headed arrows that show the orientation of the molecules attached along the DNA strand,  said Moerner.  This orientation information reports on the local structure of the DNA bases because they constrain the molecule. If we didn t have this orientation information the image would just be a spot.  Adding more nanoscale information A strand of DNA is a very long, but narrow string, just a few nanometers across. Single-molecule microscopy, together with fluorescent dyes that attach to DNA, can be used to better visualize this tiny string. Until now, it was difficult to understand how those dyes were oriented and impossible to know if the fluorescent dye was attached to the DNA in a rigid or somewhat loose way. Adam S. Backer, first author of the paper, developed a fairly simple way to obtain orientation and rotational dynamics from thousands of single molecules in parallel.  Our new imaging technique examines how each individual dye molecule labeling the DNA is aligned relative to the much larger structure of DNA,  said Backer.  We are also measuring how wobbly each of these molecules is, which can tell us whether this molecule is stuck in one particular alignment or whether it flops around over the course of our measurement sequence.  The new technique offers more detailed information than today s so-called  ensemble  methods, which average the orientations for a group of molecules, and it is much faster than confocal microscopy techniques, which analyze one molecule at a time. The new method can even be used for molecules that are relatively dim. Because the technique provides nanoscale information about the DNA itself, it could be useful for monitoring DNA conformation changes or damage to a particular region of the DNA, which would show up as changes in the orientation of dye molecules. It could also be used to monitor interactions between DNA and proteins, which drive many cellular processes. 30,000 single-molecule orientations  The researchers tested the enhanced DNA imaging technique by using it to analyze an intercalating dye; a type of fluorescent dye that slides into the areas between DNA bases. In a typical imaging experiment, they acquire up to 300,000 single molecule locations and 30,000 single-molecule orientation measurements in just over 13 minutes. The analysis showed that the individual dye molecules were oriented perpendicular to the DNA strand s axis and that while the molecules tended to orient in this perpendicular direction, they also moved around within a constrained cone. The investigators next performed a similar analysis using a different type of fluorescent dye that consists of two parts: one part that attaches to the side of the DNA and a fluorescent part that is connected via a floppy tether. The enhanced DNA imaging technique detected this floppiness, showing that the method could be useful in helping scientists understand, on a molecule by molecule basis, whether different labels attach to DNA in a mobile or fixed way. In the paper, the researchers demonstrated a spatial resolution of around 25 nanometers and single-molecule orientation measurements with an accuracy of around 5 degrees. They also measured the rotational dynamics, or floppiness, of single-molecules with an accuracy of about 20 degrees. How it works To acquire single-molecule orientation information, the researchers used a well-studied technique that adds an optical element called an electro-optic modulator to the single-molecule microscope. For each camera frame, this device changed the polarization of the laser light used to illuminate all the fluorescent dyes. Since fluorescent dye molecules with orientations most closely aligned with the laser light s polarization will appear brightest, measuring the brightness of each molecule in each camera frame allowed the researchers to quantify orientation and rotational dynamics on a molecule-by-molecule basis. Molecules that switched between bright and dark in sequential frames were rigidly constrained at a particular orientation while those that appeared bright for sequential frames were not rigidly holding their orientation.  If someone has a single-molecule microscope, they can perform our technique pretty easily by adding the electro-optic modulator,  said Backer.  We ve used fairly standard tools in a slightly different way and analyzed the data in a new way to gain additional biological and physical insight. ","Published: June 20, 2016"

While other studies have linked a woman s health in pregnancy to her child s weight later in life, a mouse study at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis is the first to indicate that even before becoming pregnant, a woman s obesity can cause genetic abnormalities that subsequently are passed through the female bloodline to at least three generations, increasing the risk of obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  Our findings indicate that a mother s obesity can impair the health of later generations,  said Kelle H. Moley, MD, the School of Medicine s James P. Crane Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and senior author of the study.  This is particularly important because more than two-thirds of reproductive-age women in the United States are overweight or obese.  The study is published online June 16 in the journal Cell Reports. The research shows that a mother s obesity   and its associated metabolic problems   can be inherited through mitochondrial DNA present in the unfertilized oocyte, or egg. Mitochondria often are referred to as the powerhouses of cells because they supply energy for metabolism and other biochemical processes. These cellular structures have their own sets of genes, inherited only from mothers, not fathers.  Our data are the first to show that pregnant mouse mothers with metabolic syndrome can transmit dysfunctional mitochondria through the female bloodline to three generations,  Moley said.  Importantly, our study indicates oocytes   or mothers  eggs   may carry information that programs mitochondrial dysfunction throughout the entire organism.  From six weeks prior to conception until weaning, the researchers fed mice a high-fat, high-sugar diet comprised of about 60 percent fat and 20 percent sugar.  This mimics more of the Western diet,  Moley said.  Basically, it s like eating fast food every day.  Offspring then were fed a controlled diet of standard rodent chow, which is high in protein and low in fat and sugar. Despite the healthy diet, the pups, grand pups and great-grand pups developed insulin resistance and other metabolic problems. Researchers found abnormal mitochondria in muscle and skeletal tissue of the mice.  It s important to note that in humans, in which the diets of children closely mirror those of their parents, the effects of maternal metabolic syndrome may be greater than in our mouse model,  Moley said. More research is needed to determine if a consistent diet low in fat and sugar, as well as regular exercise, may reverse genetic metabolic abnormalities.  In any case, eating nutritiously is critical,  Moley said.  Over the decades, our diets have worsened, in large part due to processed foods and fast foods. We re seeing the effects in the current obesity crisis. Research, including this study, points to poor maternal nutrition and a predisposition to obesity. ","Published: June 20, 2016"

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/guided-chemotherapy-missiles-196609,Guided Chemotherapy Missiles Latching chemotherapy drugs onto proteins that seek out tumors could provide a new way of treating tumors in the brain or with limited blood supply that are hard to reach with traditional chemotherapy  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. There s a good, bad and ugly to cancer chemotherapy. The good is that the drugs do often effectively kill cancer cells. The bad is that the drugs also damage other quickly dividing cells in the body, causing side effects ranging from cosmetic, like hair loss, to disabling. The ugly occurs when the drug dose needed to kill a tumor is more than what a person s body can handle. This might happen if the tumor doesn t have much of a blood supply and very little of the drug, which is delivered through the bloodstream, can get in. A dose high enough to infiltrate the tumor could be deadly to other cells in the body. Some recently approved therapies get around this problem using antibodies to deliver a drug directly to tumors, bypassing healthy cells and possibly overcoming some of the uglier aspects of cancer chemotherapy. Now Jennifer Cochran, associate professor of bioengineering, has built on this antibody approach using an engineered protein rather than an antibody to direct the drug to the tumor. Although the two techniques are conceptually similar, the specialized protein has the potential advantage of being able to pass through the barrier that protects the brain, thereby being able to treat brain tumors. It is also smaller than the antibody and might be able to reach dense tumors with little blood supply.  Antibodies can be limited for treating solid tumors because they are too big to penetrate well,  Cochran said.  The idea is that a smaller molecule could diffuse into the tumor better.  The work was published in a series of papers in the June issue of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics and the June 15 issue of Angewandte Chemie. Targeting cancer Cochran s idea originated with the knowledge that cancer cells, and the blood supply that feeds them, often produce particular molecules known as integrins on their surface. The goal of her team was to create an engineered protein that could latch tightly onto those integrins and be used as a drug delivery vehicle. First, the team needed to engineer a protein to bind integrins. Cochran employed a technique called directed evolution to rapidly engineer millions of proteins and screen for the qualities she s interested in. In this case, they started with a protein called knottin   so named for its knot-like shape   and used directed evolution to engineer a protein variant that would bind strongly to integrins. The researchers then worked on two strategies for attaching chemotherapeutic drugs to the evolved knottin. One strategy, carried out in collaboration with Sutro Biopharma, and led by postdoctoral fellow Nicolas Currier and bioengineering graduate student Shelley Ackerman, used a portion of an antibody to connect the drug to the knottin, mimicking antibody therapies that are already on the market   perhaps speeding the time it would take to get this therapy approved for patients. The team tested this approach in a lab dish and in mice with implanted human tumors and in each case the knottin successfully delivered the drug to the tumor and killed the cancer cells. A second approach, developed in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Nick Cox in the Stanford ChEM-H Medicinal Chemistry Knowledge Center, used a small chemical link to attach a chemotherapeutic drug directly to the knottin. The knottin-drug combination effectively killed breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells in a lab dish. The targeted drug delivery was highly effective against cancer cells, including those that had developed a resistance to the drug alone.  We found that when the drug was delivered by the knottin, its potency was greatly enhanced in treating highly resistant tumor cells, like those found in pancreatic cancer,  Cox said. In both examples, the knottin portion of these multipart compounds binds to integrins present at high levels on cancer cells, delivering the drug directly into the cancer cell and bypassing healthy cells. Once inside, the drug is released and kills the cell. Because the drug is less active when connected to the knottin and cannot get inside cells of the body that do not express integrins, this approach could significantly reduce side effects on other tissues and organs. Building on the past This isn t the first time Cochran has taken advantage of knottin s affection for cancer cells. In previous work her team had attached the engineered knottin to a fluorescent dye that was visible by molecular imaging techniques. This dye-labeled knottin could seek out and attach to cancer cells in the brain and elsewhere in the body and make them visible to doctors, who often have a hard time detecting whether drugs are shrinking tumors. That previous work gave Cochran and her team some useful information. First, they learned that the knottin can get past a barrier that protects the brain from many molecules. And second, they learned that the knottin does seek out cancer cells compared to healthy tissue. If it didn t, the imaging signal would show a blur of light rather than visibly highlighting tumors.  We ve shown that these knottins can pass the blood-tumor barrier so the hope is that we can use this to deliver chemotherapy to brain tumors,  Cochran said. Cochran is collaborating with Michelle Monje, assistant professor of neurology, and Gerald Grant, associate professor of neurosurgery, with the support of seed grants from Stanford Bio-X and the Stanford Child Health Research Institute to test this approach on childhood brain tumors. These two knottin-based therapies are a first step.  These studies showed that we could use these molecules to deliver drugs to tumors,  Cochran said.  What we still need to understand is which cancers it works best on and what is the best chemotherapeutic drug to use.  She and her team are also still exploring which of the two approaches will be most effective. The larger protein-drug combination might not work its way into dense tumors, for example, but will remain longer in the body and thus might deliver more benefits over time. The smaller compound could penetrate more effectively into tumors but will be cleared quickly from the bloodstream, possibly reducing its effectiveness.","Published: June 20, 2016"

To answer this question, researchers at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan have combined experimental and modeling approaches to reveal the process through which smell preference is computed in the brain. Published in Neuron, the work shows how the activity of neurons in the olfactory processing center of the Drosophila brain can be decoded to predict behavioral responses to odors, and reveals that the relative preference of odors can flip depending on the situation. See Also: Can autism be measured in a sniff?For many animals, the sense of smell the ability to detect and interpret chemicals in the environment is fundamental to survival. From insects to mammals, olfaction is central to a range of behaviors, including foraging, habitat and prey location, predator avoidance, and social communication. While responding appropriately to odors requires the ability to distinguish those that are harmful from those that are beneficial, how this is achieved in the brain is an open question. When an odor is smelled, it activates a population of small neuronal structures called glomeruli in the first olfactory center of the brain. While odor information is generally recognized to be encoded as patterns of glomerular activity across space and time, the sheer number of glomeruli about 1,800 in mice and 5,500 in humans is a major impediment to olfactory research. To overcome this obstacle, Hokto Kazama and his team took advantage of the simpler olfactory system in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which is similar in function and organization to that of mammals, but contains only about 50 glomeruli. Explains Kazama, ""Because of the limited number of glomeruli, we were able to use two-photon calcium imaging technology to systematically record odor-evoked activity from almost all fly glomeruli in response to a large number of odorants."" Don't Miss: Receptor in nasal cavity may be linked to preference for high-fat food Fly behavior was monitored in a clever flight-simulator arena. In this virtual reality system, the fly's head is fixed and surrounded by an olfactory and visual landscape that is rotated in real-time in response to wing movements. The flies displayed a continuum of responses ranging from strong attraction to strong aversion virtually flying into or away from the odor and their judgments were made extremely quickly, sometimes in as short as 200 milliseconds. By analyzing these behavioral and physiological data, researchers formulated a mathematical model that explains how attraction and repulsion to odorants can be computed from the activity of olfactory glomeruli. Their model suggests that each glomerulus contributes to attraction or aversion with a specific weight. Summing the transformed and weighted activity of all glomeruli not only matched the real behavioral responses to the odors used to make the model, but also accurately predicted responses to new odorants. Kazama notes that contrary to the prevalent hypothesis in the field, the results imply that this computation does not rely on a small subset of glomeruli, but likely requires most, if not all, of them. Learn More: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells The model also predicted that the relative preference of odors would vary, and could even switch, depending on the nature of other odorants present in the environment. The team performed a series of experiments in which the same odors were presented under different conditions, and successfully verified this prediction. Adds Kazama, ""Not only does this demonstrate that even flies have the ability to adapt to their olfactory environment, it exemplifies the usefulness of our approach that combines physiological measurements with mathematical modeling of behavior and neural activity."" Because the basic function and wiring of the olfactory system are well conserved from flies to humans, the study is expected to provide a deeper understanding of the principles and mechanisms of olfactory processing in the human brain.

The results of the National Institutes of Health- (NIH)-funded study are published in Neurology. See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified These findings are part of the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution (DEFUSE)-2 Study, which was designed to see how MRIs can help determine which patients undergo endovascular therapy following ischemic stroke caused by a clot blocking blood flow to the brain. Endovascular treatment targets the ischemic clot itself, either removing it or breaking it up with a stent. The blood-brain barrier is a layer of cells that protects the brain from harmful molecules passing through the bloodstream. After stroke, the barrier is disrupted, becoming permeable and losing control over what gets into the brain. ""The biggest impact of this research is that information from MRI scans routinely collected at a number of research hospitals and stroke centers can inform treating physicians on the risk of bleeding,"" said Richard Leigh, MD, a scientist at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and an author on the study. In this study, brain scans were collected from more than 100 patients before they underwent endovascular therapy, within 12 hours of stroke onset. Dr. Leigh and his team obtained the images from DEFUSE-2 investigators. Learn More: GI tract bacteria help decrease stroke Using a new method of image processing, Dr. Leigh's group was able to get detailed measurements on the extent to which the blood-brain barrier is disrupted following a stroke. Combining that data with findings from the DEFUSE-2 study revealed that large degrees of blood-brain barrier disruption were associated with severe bleeding following endovascular therapy. Extensive breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was associated with parenchymal hematoma, a form of bleeding in the brain that carries the greatest risk for the patient. In addition, the results showed a link between the location of blood-brain barrier damage and post-treatment brain bleeding. Ischemic stroke patients are increasingly receiving combination therapy, endovascular treatment along with an intravenous drug known as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), to effectively break up clots in the brain. However, bleeding into the damaged brain tissue is a serious complication of both acute stroke therapies. t-PA has been shown to be most effective when given within a few hours of stroke onset, but the treatment window for endovascular therapy is unknown. ""With the growing precision of brain imaging technology, researchers are able to get a detailed look at what is going on in the brain during a stroke. Innovative studies, such as DEFUSE-2, can help patients and their doctors make more informed decisions about medical care,"" said Walter Koroshetz, MD, director of NINDS. Don't Miss: Researchers study differences in ischemic stroke in marijuana users According to the authors, examining blood-brain barrier disruption on brain images may potentially help doctors identify patients not likely to benefit from endovascular therapy.

The DEFUSE-3 trial is currently underway, in which researchers will use imaging data to select patients for endovascular therapy up to 16 hours after stroke onset.

Combining clinical evaluations of a patient's mental and physical abilities with brain imaging studies that tracked the levels of dopamine, the lack of which is thought to cause Parkinson's, doctors from the Departments of Integrative Medicine, Neurology, and Radiology, at Thomas Jefferson University showed that patients receiving NAC improved on both measures. See Also: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity Current treatments for Parkinson's disease are generally limited to temporarily replacing dopamine in the brain as well as some medications designed to slow the progression of the disease process. Recently, researchers have shown that oxidative stress in the brain may play a critical role in the Parkinson's disease process, and that this stress also lowers levels of glutathione, a chemical produced by the brain to counteract oxidative stress. Studies in brain cells showed that NAC helps reduce oxidative damage to neurons by helping restore the levels of the antioxidant glutathione. NAC is an oral supplement that can be obtained at most nutrition stores, and interestingly also comes in an intravenous form which is used to protect the liver in acetaminophen overdose. ""This study reveals a potentially new avenue for managing Parkinson's patients and shows that n-acetylcysteine may have a unique physiological effect that alters the disease process and enables dopamine neurons to recover some function,"" said senior author on the paper Daniel Monti, MD, MBA, Director of the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine, and the Brind-Marcus Center of Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University. In this study, Parkinson's patients who continued their current standard of care treatment, were placed into two groups. The first group received a combination of oral and intravenous (IV) NAC for three months. These patients received 50mg/kg NAC intravenously once per week and 600mg NAC orally 2x per day on the non IV days. The second group, the control patients, received only their standard of care for Parkinson's treatment. Patients were evaluated initially, before starting the NAC and then after three months of receiving the NAC while the control patients were simply evaluated initially and three months later. The evaluation consisted of standard clinical measures such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a survey administered by doctors to help determine the stage of disease, and a brain scan via DaTscan SPECT imaging, which measures the amount of dopamine transporter in the basal ganglia, the area most affected by the Parkinson's disease process. Compared to controls, the patients receiving NAC had improvements of 4-9 percent in dopamine transporter binding and also had improvements in their UPDRS score of about 13 percent.

Mole-rats live up to 30 years, 10 times longer than mice, and captured colonies almost never show any type of cancer. Understanding these animals  anti-cancer mechanisms may help advance human treatment in the future, according to a collaborative research team from Hokkaido University and Keio University in Japan. The research team took skin fibroblast tissue from adult mole-rats and reprogrammed the cells to revert to pluripotent stem cells. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and, like embryonic stem cells, are capable of becoming any type of tissue in the body. However, these stem cells can also form tumours called teratomas when transplanted back into the animals. When the mole-rats  iPSCs were inserted into the testes of mice with extremely weak immune systems, the team discovered that they didn t form tumours in contrast to human iPSCs and mouse iPSCs. Upon further investigation, they found that a tumour-suppressor gene called alternative reading frame (ARF), which is normally suppressed in mouse and human iPSCs, remained active in the mole-rat iPSCs. The team also found that ERAS, a tumorigenic gene expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and iPSCs, was mutated and dysfunctional in the mole-rat iPSCs. When the researchers disabled the ARF gene, forced the expression of the mouse ERAS gene in the mole-rat iPSCs, and then inserted them into the mice, the mice grew large tumours. When researchers suppressed the ARF gene in mole-rat cells during the reprogramming process to iPSCs, the cells stopped proliferation with sign of cellular senescence, while the opposite happens with mouse cells. Researchers theorize that this further helps protect the naked mole-rat by reducing the chance for tumour formation. They call this ARF suppression-induced senescence (ASIS) and it appears to be unique to the naked mole-rat. These findings could help researchers figure out how human iPSCs can be used for treating patients without forming tumours, which is one of the major challenges associated with undifferentiated iPSCs.  Further research into the detailed mechanisms underlying ASIS in naked mole-rats may shed new light on cancer resistance in the mole-rats and contribute to the generation of non-tumorigenic human-iPSCs, enabling safer cell-based therapeutics,  said Kyoko Miura, an assistant professor at Hokkaido University.","Published: June 17, 2016"

In the June 15 issue of Science Translational Medicine, the team led by investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Broad Institute describes findings that may help understand how the gut microbiome is established and how the combination of microbes in individual children may contribute to the risk of developing conditions like type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.   One of the key motivations of microbiome research is that the microbial population of early childhood appears to be critical to human health, in that decreased diversity of the gut microbiome has been implicated in a number of allergic and autoimmune diseases,  says Ramnik Xavier, MD, PhD, chief of the MGH Gastrointestinal Unit and an institute member at the Broad.  Not only did our study analyze the gut microbiome at a high resolution that allowed us to identify both microbial species and strains, but by following our study participants over time we also were able to uncover findings that would not have been revealed by single samples from each patient.  In collaboration with a team of Finnish researchers they have worked with for several years, the MGH/Broad team enrolled a group of 39 children from whom monthly stool samples were taken beginning after birth and continuing until age 36 months. Each sample was analyzed with a standard, RNA-based sequencing procedure used to identify microbial populations, and more detailed whole-genome sequencing was conducted on about 25 percent of samples to reveal the specific strains of identified microbial species. During the study period, 20 of the participants received antibiotics to treat respiratory or ear infections, with those children receiving from 9 to 15 treatments.  Many features of the developing gut microbiome were found to be consistent across all study participants, with the presence and abundance of particular species rising and falling at similar age points. The researchers also found several clear differences from the findings of previous studies regarding the impact of breastfeeding. Earlier studies comparing breast-fed with formula-fed children have reported increased abundance of Bifidobacterium species in those who were breast-fed for longer periods of time. All of the children in this study were breastfed for some period of time, and while there was some correlation between the length of breastfeeding and levels of Bifidobacteria, some of the children in this group had low levels of those bacteria even while being breastfed.  Previous studies also have reported finding a particular microbiome signature, with low abundance of the Bacteriodes genus, in cesarean-section-delivered children during the first 6 months of life. In the current study, the researchers found the same pattern in the four cesarean children but were surprised to find it also occurred in seven of the vaginally born children. No identified factors, including maternal antibiotic treatment, differentiated between vaginally born children with or without the low-Bacteriodes signature, but since this pattern has been associated with reduced overall diversity of the microbiome, it bears further investigation, Xavier notes.  Children who had been exposed to antibiotic treatment had a reduction in the diversity of their microbial population, a difference that was even greater in those who also had the low-Bacteriodessignature. Whole-gene sequencing also found that, in antibiotic-exposed children, bacterial species tended to be fewer and dominated by a single strain, instead of the several species and strains seen in those not treated with antibiotics. The analysis of many samples taken over time revealed that the microbiomes of antibiotic-exposed children were less stable, particularly around the time of antibiotic treatment.  The presence of genes known to confer antibiotic resistance rose rapidly during antibiotic treatment. Levels of resistance genes encoded on microbial chromosomes dropped quickly after treatment was discontinued. But resistance genes encoded on small DNA molecules called mobile elements   one means by which resistance genes can be transmitted among bacteria   persisted much longer after antibiotic withdrawal.   Some of the things we d like to investigate next are how the microbiome gets established during the first week of life   particularly what the primary mechanisms of transmission are   how the composition of the early-life gut microbiome affects children s health, and what factors underlie the resilience of the infant microbiome, says Xavier, who is the Isselbacher Professor of Medicine in Gastroenterology at Harvard Medical School and a member of the MGH Center for Computational and Integrative Biology (CCIB).  The kind of high-resolution sequencing done in this study should lead to better understanding of the natural history of the infant gut microbiome and the impact of perturbations caused by antibiotics and environmental factors.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/revealing-tcells-in-action-207769,Revealing T Cells in Action Salk scientists show how T cell receptors reposition during an immune response  revealing more on how the immune system is regulated  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.When the body is fighting an invading pathogen, white blood cells including T cells must respond. Now, Salk Institute researchers have imaged how vital receptors on the surface of T cells bundle together when activated. This study, the first to visualize this process in lymph nodes, could help scientists better understand how to turn up or down the immune system s activity to treat autoimmune diseases, infections or even cancer.   We had seen these receptors cluster and reposition in cultured cells that were artificially stimulated in the lab, but we ve never seen their natural arrangements in lymph nodes until now,  says senior author Bj rn Lillemeier, an associate professor in Salk s Nomis Laboratories for Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis, and the Waitt Advanced Biophotonics Center. T cells are activated when receptors embedded in their outer membrane bind to other immune cells that have digested an antigen, such as a virus, bacteria or cancer cell. In turn, the activated T cells switch on cellular pathways that help the body both actively seek out and destroy the antigen and remember it for the future. In the past, by looking at T-cell receptors embedded in isolated cells under the microscope, researchers discovered that the receptors are arranged in clusters called protein islands that merge when the cells are activated. Lillemeier wanted more detail on how the receptors are arranged in tissue and how that arrangement might change when the T cells are activated in living hosts. The team used a super-resolution microscope developed in the laboratory of co-senior author Hu Cang, assistant professor at Salk s Waitt Advanced Biophotonics Center and holder of the Frederick B. Rentschler Developmental Chair. This microscopy approach, called light-sheet direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), let the researchers watch T cell receptors in the membranes of T cells in mouse lymph nodes at a resolution of approximately 50 nanometers. The new imagery confirmed the previous observation that protein islands of T-cell receptors merge into larger  microclusters  when T cells are activated. But it also showed that, before cells are activated, the protein islands are already arranged in groups dubbed  territories  by Lillemeier s team.  The pre-organization on the molecular level basically turns the T cell into a loaded gun,  says Lillemeier. The organization of surface receptors enables T cells to launch fast and effective immune response against antigens. Understanding how the molecular organization mediates the sensitivity of T cell responses could help researchers make the immune system more or less sensitive. In the case of autoimmune diseases, clinicians would like to turn down the immune system s activity, while turning up the activity could help fight infections or cancers. The research could also have implications for understanding other receptors in the body, which have a wide range of functions both within and outside the immune system.  We think that most receptors on the surfaces of cells are organized like this,  says Ying Hu, first author and postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute.","Published: June 17, 2016"

The new method, reported in Nature, is a significant advance because it can be applied to a large set of proteins at once, even to the thousands of distinct proteins directly in their native cellular environment. The TSRI researchers demonstrated the technique to find  ligands  (binding partners) for many proteins previously thought to bind poorly to small molecules that can be used to determine the functions of their protein targets and can serve as starting compounds for the development of drugs. Among the newly discovered ligands are selective inhibitors of two caspase enzymes, which have key roles in multiple diseases but have largely eluded efforts to target them with drugs.  Our data suggest that the human proteome is much more broadly targetable with small molecules than has been previously appreciated,  said principal investigator Benjamin F. Cravatt, chair of the Department of Chemical Physiology and member of the Dorris Neuroscience Center and Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI.  That opens up new possibilities for developing scientific probes and ultimately drugs.  Putting Fragments to Use Researchers have long sought better ways to identify small-molecule ligands for human proteins and to determine which proteins in our cells are inherently  ligandable.  Biologists typically have used complex computer algorithms to predict whether a given class of proteins can bind adequately to small molecules. Pharmaceutical researchers often won t even try to develop drugs to target proteins that are thought unligandable. Several large protein classes are believed to be in this category, and so far only about 600 of the roughly 20,000 human proteins have been targeted successfully with FDA-approved drugs.  There really hasn t been a way to determine empirically, rather than theoretically, what fraction of the human proteome can be targeted by small molecules,  Cravatt said. The new method is partly based on an approach known as fragment-based ligand discovery, which uses candidate ligand molecules about half the size of the small molecules in pill-based drugs. For initial screens to find potential ligands, such  fragment  molecules are much more efficient than drug-sized molecules, requiring much smaller libraries of compounds for a thorough search. Cravatt s team attached candidate fragment molecules to a class of other molecules that, when they can get close enough, react strongly with cysteine amino-acids on proteins, locking the ligands to the proteins with strong  covalent  bonds.  You still need an affinity-based interaction, but the covalent bonding event provides a significant boost in potency,  said Keriann M. Backus, a research associate in the Cravatt laboratory who is first author of the study with TSRI Professional Scientific Collaborator Bruno Correia. The scientists devised a screening system in which they can apply these covalent-bonding fragment molecules one by one to entire collections of proteins expressed in human cells. The method can even be used with intact, living cells in a culture dish. The system allows researchers to detect and identify which small-molecule fragments have bound covalently to which proteins in the samples and which specific sites on the proteins are responsible for binding. Applying a small library of cysteine-reactive fragments to the proteins found in two types of human cancer cells, the scientists found that the fragments successfully  liganded  more than 750 different cysteines found on more than 600 distinct proteins which equated to more than 20 percent of all the proteins assayed in the samples. Many of these proteins belonged to protein classes, such as transcription factors, that have been considered virtually unligandable, and therefore  undruggable.  In fact, about 85 percent of the newly liganded proteins are not listed in a standard database of proteins with known small-molecule ligands.  This experiment has effectively expanded what we think of as the ligandable proteome,  said Backus. Potential to Develop Probes and Drugs The researchers were able to confirm the accuracy of the system, for example, by showing that it can identify the known protein targets of a covalent-binding anti-cancer drug, ibrutinib. The team also demonstrated that some of the protein-binding ligand molecules identified with the system have strong biological activity and thus have the potential to be developed into scientific probes or drugs. Newly discovered ligands for the enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, for example, turned out to block the activity of the normal versions of the enzymes as well as the mutant versions implicated in many cancers. In a final set of experiments, the team showed that one of its identified ligands inhibits the activities of caspase-8 and caspase-10, two enzymes that help switch on the cellular self-destruct process known as apoptosis. An excess of apoptosis is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer s and Huntington s disease, as well as the brain damage occurring in the aftermath of strokes and other brain injuries. By contrast, a lack of apoptosis in certain cells is believed to contribute to cancers and autoimmune diseases. However, scientists don t understand enough about the roles of these enzymes, since they have been largely unable to find small molecules that selectively inhibit specific caspases. In this case, Cravatt s team found that their initially identified anti-caspase ligand works by binding the precursor forms of caspase-8 and -10. They chemically modified the ligand into one that selectively binds just the precursor of caspase-8, and, using their two ligands as probes, were able to discover new details of how caspase-8 and -10 promote apoptosis in human T-cells.  In essence, we demonstrated that our new platform works and that we can use the ligands it identifies to do useful biology,  said Backus. Backus and other members of the Cravatt laboratory are now doing several further studies: optimizing many of the newly identified ligands into probes for exploring protein functions; making a more comprehensive catalogue of cysteine-containing proteins that are ligandable; and expanding the method to target other amino-acids besides cysteine.  We will be occupied for some time following up on this development,  said Cravatt.

New treatments are discovered by exploring biological pathways that cause disease but can be modified by drugs. The route from the basic biology to large-scale randomized trials in humans is long and expensive   estimated at over $1.2 billion to get one product to market. In part, that cost is because the route to a successful drug is littered with those that have fallen by the wayside at various points during development. However, a study of one such unsuccessful drug has pointed to a way that could reduce costs. Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) circulates with cholesterol in the blood and high levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so inhibiting Lp-PLA2 might be beneficial.  Darapladib, an inhibitor of Lp-PLA2,was developed by Human Genome Sciences which GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) bought for US$ 3 billion in 2012. But two large phase III trials of darapladib funded by GSK were disappointing failures. The investment in the Lp-PLA2 inhibitor did not pay off because the biological pathway turned out to be one that caused cardiovascular disease. Researchers at the University of Oxford and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences joined forces with GSK to explore whether this disappointing result could have been predicted by using a genetic variant that mimics the drug effect. People with a non-functioning variant have lower levels of Lp-PLA2 so the idea is to see if these people have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those with functioning variants. In a study of over 90,000 participants in the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) study, the association between this genetic variant and a range of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases was explored. This method is termed 'Mendelian randomization' because it relies on the way the play of chance determines the genetic variants inherited at conception, and allows nature to mimic randomised controlled trials. The researchers found that people with a non-functioning genetic variant were not at lower risk of developing cardiovascular (and other non-cardiovascular) diseases   upholding the trial findings. Compared with the many steps in the traditional pathway to drug development (at a cost of several billion dollars) the availability of large scale biobanks make the cost of carrying out Mendelian randomization analyses trivial. This methodology is likely to be much more widely used to examine the causal nature of biological pathways involved in diseases before mounting large-scale trials in the future. Study lead author Dr Iona Millwood, from the University of Oxford, said 'Our research used a genetic variant only found in East Asians, and demonstrates the value of prospective biobank studies with genetic data linked to health records, carried out in different global populations, to predict the potential benefits or harms of new drug targets.' Professor Zhengming Chen, senior author and the principal investigator of the China Kadoorie Biobank at the University of Oxford, said 'CKB is a powerful resource. Our ongoing research includes measurement of thousands of functional genetic variants which may represent potential drug targets in different biological pathways, and we are using the same approach to assess a number of other important therapeutic targets.'","Published: June 17, 2016"

While devices that can conduct breath analysis using compound semiconductors exist, they are bulky and too costly for commercial use, said Dr. Kenneth O, one of the principal investigators of the effort and director of TxACE. The researchers determined that using CMOS integrated circuits technology will make the electronic nose more affordable.  CMOS is the integrated circuits technology used to manufacture the bulk of electronics that have made smartphones, tablets and other devices possible.  The new research was presented in a paper titled  200-280GHz CMOS Transmitter for Rotational Spectroscopy and Demonstration in Gas Spectroscopy and Breath Analysis  at the 2016 IEEE Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits in Honolulu, Hawaii.   Smell is one of the senses of humans and animals, and there have been many efforts to build an electronic nose,  said Dr. Navneet Sharma, the lead author of paper, who recently defended his doctoral thesis at UT Dallas.  We have demonstrated that you can build an affordable electronic nose that can sense many different kinds of smells. When you re smelling something, you are detecting chemical molecules in the air. Similarly, an electronic nose detects chemical compounds using rotational spectroscopy.  The rotational spectrometer generates and transmits electromagnetic waves over a wide range of frequencies, and analyzes how the waves are attenuated to determine what chemicals are present as well as their concentrations in a sample. The system can detect low levels of chemicals present in human breath.  Breaths contain gases from the stomach and that come out of blood when it comes into contact with air in the lungs. The breath test is a blood test without taking blood samples. Breath contains information about practically every part of a human body. The electronic nose can detect gas molecules with more specificity and sensitivity than Breathalyzers, which can confuse acetone for ethanol in the breath. The distinction is important, for example, for patients with Type 1 diabetes who have high concentrations of acetone in their breath.   If you think about the industry around sensors that emulate our senses, it s huge,  said Dr. O, also a professor in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and holder of the Texas Instruments Distinguished University Chair.  Imaging applications, hearing devices, touch sensors   what we are talking about here is developing a device that imitates another one of our sensing modalities and making it affordable and widely available. The possible use of the electronic nose is almost limitless. Think about how we use smell in our daily lives.  The researchers envision the CMOS-based device will first be used in industrial settings and then in doctors  offices and hospitals. As the technology matures, they could become household devices. Dr. O said the need for blood work and gastrointestinal tests could be reduced, and diseases could be detected earlier, lowering the costs of health care.  The researchers are working toward construction of a prototype programmable electronic nose that can be made available for beta testing sometime in early 2018.  TxACE and this work are supported in large part by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and Texas Instruments Inc. Additional support was provided by Samsung Global Research Outreach.   SRC and its members, including Texas Instruments, Intel, IBM, Freescale, Mentor Graphics, ARM and GlobalFoundries, have been following this work for several years. We are excited by the possibilities of the new technology and are working to rapidly explore its uses and applications,  said Dr. David Yeh, SRC senior director.  It is a significant milestone, but there is still much more research needed for this to reach its potential.  TxACE was created in 2008 by the SRC, the state through its Texas Emerging Technology Fund, Texas Instruments, the UT System and UT Dallas.

The design of these deoxyribonucleotide primers incorporates both a relatively long  5' anchor sequence  that hybridizes strongly to target DNA fragments, and a very short, physically and functionally separate,  3' foot sequence  that is perfectly complementary to the mutant target sequence, but mismatches the wild-type sequence. As few as ten mutant fragments can reliably be detected in the presence of 1,000,000 wild-type fragments, even when the difference between the mutant and the wild type is only a single nucleotide polymorphism. Multiplex PCR assays employing a set of SuperSelective primers, and a corresponding set of differently colored molecular beacon probes, can be used in situations where the different mutations, though occurring in different cells, are located in the same codon. These non-symmetric real-time multiplex PCR assays contain limited concentrations of each SuperSelective primer, thereby enabling the simultaneous determination of each mutation s abundance by comparing its threshold value to the threshold value of a reference gene present in the sample.

By adding this bacterial species back to the guts of affected mice, the researchers were able to reverse some of the mice's behavioral deficits, which are reminiscent of symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in humans. The investigators are now looking to explore the effects of probiotics on neurodevelopmental disorders in future work. See Also: Finnish study establishes connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease ""Other research groups are trying to use drugs or electrical brain stimulation as a way to reverse some of the behavioral symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders but here we have, perhaps, a new approach,"" says senior author Dr. Mauro Costa-Mattioli, associate professor of neuroscience at Baylor. ""Whether it would be effective in humans, we don't know yet, but it is an extremely exciting way of affecting the brain from the gut."" The inspiration for the paper came from human epidemiological studies that have found that maternal obesity during pregnancy could increase children's risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASDs. In addition, some individuals with ASD also report recurring gastrointestinal problems. With emerging research showing how diet can change the gut microbiome and how gut microbes can influence the brain, Costa-Mattioli and his co-authors suspected there could be a connection. To begin, the researchers fed approximately 60 female mice a high-fat diet that was the rough equivalent of consistently eating fast food multiple times a day. They bred the mice and waited for them to bear young. The offspring stayed with their mother for three weeks and then were weaned onto a normal diet. After a month, these offspring showed behavioral deficits, such as spending less time in contact with their peers and not initiating interactions. Learn More: Healthy intestinal flora keeps the mind sharp with some help from the immune system ""First we wanted to see whether there was a difference in the microbiome between the offspring of mouse mothers fed a normal diet versus those of mothers fed a high-fat diet. So, we used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to determine the bacterial composition of their gut. We found a clear difference in the microbiota of the two maternal diet groups,"" says first author Shelly Buffington, a postdoctoral fellow in Costa-Mattioli's lab. ""The sequencing data was so consistent that by looking at the microbiome of an individual mouse we could predict whether its behavior would be impaired."" Buffington next tested whether the specific differences in the microbiome were causative factors underlying the social impairments in offspring of mothers fed a high-fat diet. Because mice eat each other's poop, the researchers housed the animals together so that they would acquire microbiota from their cagemates. When socially impaired three-week-old mice born to mothers on a high-fat diet were paired with normal mice, a full restoration of the gut microbiome and a concurrent improvement in behavior was observed within four weeks. The investigators concluded that one or more beneficial bacterial species might be important for normal social behavior. Fecal-transplant experiments in mice without microbiota (germ-free mice) provided causal evidence that an imbalanced microbial ecology in the mice born to mothers on a high-fat diet is responsible for their social deficits. The investigators next wanted to know the specific bacterial species that could be affecting the social behavior of the mice. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing revealed one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which was reduced more than nine-fold in the microbiome of mice born to mothers on the high-fat diet. ""We cultured a strain of L. reuteri originally isolated from human breast milk and introduced it into the water of the high-fat-diet offspring. We found that treatment with this single bacterial strain was able to rescue their social behavior,"" Buffington says. Other ASD-related behaviors, such as anxiety, were not restored by the reconstitution of the bacteria. Interestingly, the authors found that L. reuteri also promoted the production of the ""bonding hormone"" oxytocin, which is known to play a crucial role in social behavior and has been associated with autism in humans. Don't Miss: Scientists show a link between intestinal bacteria and depressionThe authors wondered whether the reward circuitry in the socially impaired mice was dysfunctional. ""We found that in response to social interaction there was a lack of synaptic potentiation in a key reward area of the brain that could be seen in the normal control mice,"" Costa-Mattioli says. ""When we put the bacteria back in the maternal-high-fat-diet offspring, we could also restore the changes in synaptic function in the reward circuitry."" The researchers believe that their work, which uses a human bacterial species to promote oxytocin levels and improve social behavioral deficits in deficient mice, could be explored as a probiotic intervention for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. ""This is where the science is unexpectedly leading us.

Results from an approach dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration are published in the journal Aging. See Also: When memories age: Neuroscientists follow the trace of memoryThe study, which comes jointly from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, is the first to objectively show that memory loss in patients can be reversed, and improvement sustained, using a complex, 36-point therapeutic personalized program that involves comprehensive changes in diet, brain stimulation, exercise, optimization of sleep, specific pharmaceuticals and vitamins, and multiple additional steps that affect brain chemistry. ""All of these patients had either well-defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or had been diagnosed with AD before beginning the program,"" said author Dale Bredesen, MD, a professor at the Buck Institute and professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, who noted that patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work and those struggling at their jobs were able to improve their performance. ""Follow up testing showed some of the patients going from abnormal to normal."" One of the more striking cases involved a 66-year old professional man whose neuropsychological testing was compatible with a diagnoses of MCI and whose PET scan showed reduced glucose utilization indicative of AD. An MRI showed hippocampal volume at only the 17th percentile for his age. After 10 months on the protocol a follow-up MRI showed a dramatic increase of his hippocampal volume to the 75th percentile, with an associated absolute increase in volume of nearly 12 percent. In another instance, a 69-year old professional man and entrepreneur, who was in the process of shutting down his business, went on the protocol after 11 years of progressive memory loss. After six months, his wife, co-workers and he noted improvement in memory. A life-long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work. After 22 months on the protocol he returned for follow-up quantitative neuropsychological testing; results showed marked improvements in all categories with his long-term recall increasing from the 3rd to 84th percentile. He is expanding his business. Don't Miss: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth Another patient, a 49-year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university. She had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an Alzheimer's prevention program. After several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall, reading, navigating, vocabulary, mental clarity and facial recognition. Her foreign language ability had returned. Nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site. She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline. All but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for AD, carrying at least one copy of the APOE4 allele. Five of the patients carry two copies of APOE4 which gives them a 10-12 fold increased risk of developing AD. ""We're entering a new era,"" said Bredesen. ""The old advice was to avoid testing for APOE because there was nothing that could be done about it. Now we're recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention."" Sixty-five percent of the Alzheimer's cases in this country involve APOE4; with seven million people carrying two copies of the ApoE4 allele. Bredesen' s systems-based approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat AD and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV. Bredesen says decades of biomedical research, both in his and other labs, has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that a broader-based therapeutic approach may be more effective. ""Imagine having a roof with 36 holes in it, and your drug patched one hole very well--the drug may have worked, a single 'hole' may have been fixed, but you still have 35 other leaks, and so the underlying process may not be affected much,"" Bredesen said. ""We think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive, or even synergistic, and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance, as well."" Learn More: Biologists explore link between memory deficit and misfiring circadian clock While encouraged by the results of the study, Bredesen admits more needs to be done. ""The magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective,"" Bredesen said. ""Even though we see the far-reaching implications of this success, we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites."" Plans for larger studies are underway. Cognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults. Already, Alzheimer's disease affects approximately 5.4 million Americans and 30 million people globally. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. By 2050, it's estimated that 160 million people globally will have the disease, including 13 million Americans, leading to potential bankruptcy of the Medicare system. Unlike several other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer's disease is on the rise--recent estimates suggest that AD has become the third leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. THE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen's book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Dr. Bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer's disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.

The finding suggests that the neurological factors underlying Parkinson's, which currently affects nearly 1 million people in the United States, may be more complex than commonly believed. The study also could pave the way for strategies to detect Parkinson's earlier in its course. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making Publishing in the journal Current Biology, the UCLA-led team found that, compared to healthy individuals, people with early-stage Parkinson's have difficulty with perceptual decision-making only when the sensory information before them is weak enough that they must draw on prior experiences. When the sensory information is strong, individuals with Parkinson's are able to make decisions as well as people who are healthy. The finding may help explain a well-known phenomenon associated with Parkinson's, called paradoxical movement, in which people with the disease often even while medicated with dopamine therapy have difficulty initiating walking. Typically, these people have a shuffling gait, along with stooped posture. But when the same people are assisted by strong sensory information, such as horizontal lines drawn on the floor for them to step over, their walking and gait are significantly improved. ""This tells us that the problem for people with Parkinson's disease is not walking per se, but rather in generating the walking pattern without the assistance of sensory information,"" said study senior author Michele Basso, a professor in UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior and the department of neurobiology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Fuster Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience in the Semel Institute. ""The patients with Parkinson's disease in our study were impaired only when they had to rely on memory information to guide their actions. We believe this fundamental problem of decision-making in the absence of sufficient sensory information may be what is underlying some of the movement disorder symptoms."" Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisionsIn making perceptual decisions, people integrate memory information with the sensory information before them. For example, when people are contemplating crossing a street when a car is headed their way from a distance, they use past experience to help determine whether they have sufficient time to proceed safely. Sometimes the current information is so clear that relying on prior experiences is not necessary, but when that current information is ambiguous, it becomes more important to draw on memories. Building on nearly two decades' worth of findings by Basso and other researchers on the neurophysiological underpinnings of decision-making in monkeys, the UCLA team conducted decision-making experiments with a dozen early-stage Parkinson's disease patients and a comparison group of healthy individuals. The task involved making decisions about visual information that was more or less ambiguous, requiring the participants to draw on memories of similar previous experiences. In those cases, the patients with Parkinson's disease had trouble integrating the information from memory and making a decision, even when verbally instructed by the research team. The discovery by the UCLA team adds to a growing body of evidence that is beginning to redefine how researchers view Parkinson's. The disease has no cure, although medication or surgery can relieve symptoms to a certain extent. ""Parkinson's disease has long been seen as purely a motor problem, limited mostly to a section of the brain called the basal ganglia and a neurotransmitter called dopamine that is not produced at sufficient levels,"" Basso said. But she noted that the patients in the UCLA study were in the early stages of the disease and on medication to normalize dopamine production. Moreover, preliminary results from Basso's group show that the decision-making impairment related to memory seems unaffected by medication in early-stage patients with Parkinson's disease. ""The field is realizing that Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disease that probably involves many brain areas and neurotransmitter systems,"" Basso said. ""Our finding suggests that the dysfunction we uncovered may actually be unrelated to dopamine. New efforts by us and others are geared at finding out which other brain areas and neurotransmitters are involved, and how."" Don't Miss: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity Given that all of the patients in the UCLA study were in the early stage of the disease but still showed the decision-making dysfunction, Basso and her colleagues also hope to build on the discovery to identify a biological marker for early-stage Parkinson's disease. Detecting and treating the disease earlier would be an important strategy, given that by the time patients begin to express motor symptoms, a significant amount of damage has already been done to the brain. The next steps for the UCLA team are to perform imaging experiments in both healthy people and patients with Parkinson's disease to determine the neurological factors involved in the decision-making dysfunction.

The study, published online in Radiology, is among the first to examine what cerebral microbleeds may mean for clinical outcomes in MS. See Also: Taking vitamin D may benefit people with multiple sclerosis Cerebral microbleeds, which become more common with age and are a known risk factor for dementia, also have been associated with traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The UB researchers decided to study cerebral microbleeds and MS because they saw significant overlap in the risk factors for each condition, according to Robert Zivadinov, MD, PhD, first author, professor of neurology, director of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center and director of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Clinical and Translational Research Center of the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. ""Our hypothesis was that there is increased prevalence of cerebral microbleeds in MS because progression of that disease is associated with increased likelihood of cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, altered lipid metabolism, overweight/obesity, smoking and diabetes and migraine, all risk factors for cerebral microbleeds,"" he said. The study included 445 patients with MS; 45 with clinically isolated syndrome, which is the first MS episode a patient experiences; 51 patients with other neurological diseases; and 177 healthy controls. All study participants underwent a type of magnetic resonance imaging called susceptibility-weighted imaging that is specifically targeted to better image blood products. Learn More: Study examines association between small-vessel disease, Alzheimer pathology ""We found that 20 percent of MS patients over the age of 50 have cerebral microbleeds compared to 7 percent of healthy controls,"" said Ferdinand Schweser, PhD, assistant professor of neurology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB and senior author on the paper. Among subjects under the age of 50, 14 percent of patients with clinically isolated syndrome had microbleeds versus just 3 percent of healthy controls. The researchers found that the more cerebral microbleeds a patient had, the more severe were their physical and cognitive outcomes. In particular, MS patients who had more cerebral microbleeds had more physical disability after adjusting for age, hypertension and whole-brain volume. ""This is significant because it suggests that cerebral microbleeds are associated with increased physical disability in MS patients, independent from these additional risk factors for cerebral microbleeds,"" said Zivadinov. In terms of cognitive disability, the researchers found that in the subgroup of MS patients who underwent neuropsychological testing, those with more cerebral microbleeds had higher disability on verbal and other cognitive function tests. ""Those MS patients who have cerebral microbleeds are subject to developing more physical and cognitive disabilities earlier in their disease, and therefore monitoring them more closely might be appropriate,"" Zivadinov noted. Don't Miss: First study of brain activation in multiple sclerosis using fNIRSSignificant research is now being done on ways to combat cerebral microbleeds, Zivadinov said, adding that currently, prevention of cardiovascular risk factors was seen as the best way to prevent their formation since there are no currently available target therapies.

Older participants perceived two points as a single event even when they were located quite far apart, whereas younger people were still able to distinguish them as two distinct points.  This is evidence for degraded tactile perception at higher age. This impaired perception experienced by older people goes hand in hand with a spatial enhancement of brain activity, which researchers generally interpret as a compensatory mechanism. See Also: High-fat diet postpones brain aging in mice ""Age-related degraded perception is not irreversible; rather, it can be improved through training and learning,"" explains Dr. Hubert Dinse from the RUB Neural Plasticity Lab. The question researchers then asked was: if age-related impaired perception can be restored, will the age-related expansion of brain activity be reduced as well? In other words: can training and learning lead to a ""rejuvenation"" of the brain? Studies with young adults have shown that learning processes are typically associated with an enhanced and broadened brain activity. If age-related impaired perception can be restored through learning, learning should have a different effect on the brain in older people than in young adults: the age-related enhanced brain activity should be reduced. Yet, as the neuroscientists from Bochum observed, the opposite is the case: learning processes in old people result in a further enhancement of brain activity too, which is associated with improved perception. ""We asked ourselves: how can the different effects of enhanced brain activity on perception in older people be explained?"" recounts Dr. Burkhard Pleger from the RUB Neurology Clinic in Bergmannsheil Hospital. For the purpose of the study, the researchers used computer simulations to model both brain activity and associated perception. To this end, they simulated a number of alternatives of how those results might have been generated. These simulations showed that the observed pattern of age-related changes at the level of brain activity and perception could only be explained by the weakening of a mechanism that limits spread of activation, thus keeping activity focussed. In contrast, the observed learning effects could only be explained by reduced inhibition, which leads to higher brain activity. This mechanism is operating in both young and older people. Thus, the older brain learns according to the same principles as the younger brain. Considering the magnitude of learning-induced improved perceptual ability in younger and older participants, the study shows that older people improve even more than younger people. This result too can be explained by the computer simulations through reduced suppressive neural mechanisms in the elderly participants.

BICD2 autoantibodies are found in approximately 30% of patients with SSc, and are highly associated with the limited form of SSc. Beyond the classical markers such as anti-Centromere antibodies and anti-Scl70 antibodies, BICD2 autoantibodies are most abundant in SSc patients. The Multilisa  BICD2 ELISA is intended for the semi-quantitative determination of autoantibodies to BICD2, an evolutionarily conserved motor adaptor protein involved in the dynein-mediated transport process. SSc is a rare systemic autoimmune disease that manifests as progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The disease is associated with the presence of several specific autoantibodies to intracellular targets, which occur in around 80% of patients. As autoantibody specificities are strongly associated with patterns of organ involvement and disease outcome, understanding their mechanisms are an essential tool in the clinical management of SSc.

This is the first evidence we ve seen that a virus can donate an immunity system via CRISPR,  says University of British Columbia virologist Curtis Suttle.  This is like a hacker compromising a computer system, and then immediately patching it to ensure other hackers can t break in.  CRISPR or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats are libraries of DNA typically used by bacteria to identify, and then destroy, infecting viruses. Since 2012, CRISPR has also been adopted by scientists as a revolutionary gene editing and manipulation technique. Suttle and UBC colleagues Caroline Ch nard and Jennifer Wirth say the N1 virus likely uses the trick to help cyanobacteria from the ecologically important Nostoc and Anabaena genera to fight off infection by other viruses, while continuing to be a suitable host for itself.  Bacteria and their viruses have a shared evolutionary history stretching for billions of years,  says Suttle.  So at some point along the way N1 stole a defensive CRISPR array from Nostoc or a close relative.  Both groups of cyanobacteria are abundant members of habitats ranging from the bottom of ice-covered polar lakes, hypertrophic coastal lagoons, to rice paddy soils and rock-pool communities in Karst regions. Their ancestors were responsible for producing the oxygen on Earth, and close relatives of Nostoc are still responsible for producing a huge portion of the air we breathe.","Published: June 16, 2016"

As described in the journal Nano Letters, the investigators used the device to track levels of the Alzheimer s-disease-associated proteins amyloid-beta (A-beta) and tau in neurons and other cells exposed to an anesthetic known to produce Alzheimer s-like changes in the brains of mice. Their results support the view that the generation of A-beta is among the first steps leading to the characteristic neurodegeneration of Alzheimer s disease.   To study the dynamics of A-beta and tau, we needed a way to trigger the expression of both proteins and a tool to track dynamic changes of protein expression,  says lead author Feng Liang, PhD, a research fellow at the Rowland Institute.  In 2008, some of the MGH members of the current team showed that the anesthetic isoflurane induced characteristic changes seen in Alzheimer s disease   including activation of cell-death enzymes and generation of A-beta   in cultured cells and in mouse brains. In 2014, the Harvard/Rowland researchers demonstrated the ability of their nanodevice to detect levels of intracellular proteins in living, cultured cells. The current study merges both of these accomplishments to investigate a key question regarding the mechanism of Alzheimer s disease   whether generation of A-beta precedes or follows the generation of the abnormal form of tau that characterizes the disease. The tip of the device developed by the Harvard/Rowland investigators is around 50 nanometers (billionths of a meter) across, about 200 times smaller than a single cell. An integrated gold nanorod serves as the biosensor for what is called surface plasmon resonance   an oscillation of electrons in response to a light signal that can generate an optical readout reflecting protein binding signals. Antibodies targeting specific proteins can be integrated into the probe to give specific measurements of protein levels. The team first demonstrated that it was possible to use the nanoplasmonic fiber tip probe (nFTP) to quantify protein levels in individual cells without affecting their vitality and viability.  Using the nFTP device the investigators then tracked the changing levels of A-beta and the Alzheimer s-associated form of tau, which is characterized by excess phosphate molecules, in cultured cells that had been treated with isoflurane. The readings indicated that the increase in A-beta expression preceded the rise in phosphorylated tau levels by several hours. The team then showed that, while blocking A-beta expression reduced tau levels, blocking tau did not prevent the initial rise in A-beta. However, without phosphorylated tau expression, A-beta levels eventually began to drop, suggesting a sequence in which A-beta generation stimulates tau phosphorylation, which promotes further generation of A-beta.   We have brought the traditional immunoassay into living cells with exquisite sensitivity,  says Qimin Quan, PhD, a junior fellow at the Rowland Institute and co-corresponding author of the Nano Letters report.  The device is still limited in its ability to measure a large number of single cells, requiring further improvement. But its high-sensitivity, label-free and single-cell capability make it a unique tool for diagnosing clinically obtained limited samples.  Zhongcong Xie, MD, PhD, director of the Geriatric Anesthesia Research Unit in the MGH Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine and co-corresponding author of the study, adds,  Each year approximately 8.5 million patients with Alzheimer s disease need anesthesia and surgical care worldwide. Learning how anesthesia affects the mechanisms behind Alzheimer s will require collaboration among specialists in anesthesia, neurology and engineering. Moreover, this use of both an anesthetic and the nFTP device to measure interactions between A-beta and tau is just a first step.  Xie is a professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School.

The researchers suggest that the effects of drugs on fetal brain function should be assessed more carefully, indications for preventive medication should be critically evaluated, and non-pharmacological interventions should be the first-line treatment for depression and anxiety during pregnancy. ""We found many changes in the brain activity of SRI-exposed newborns,"" says Professor Sampsa Vanhatalo, head of the BABA center at the Helsinki University Children's Hospital. ""Since the changes did not correlate with the mother's psychiatric symptoms, we have assumed that they resulted as a side effect of maternal drug treatment."" See Also: New studies show no long term effects of antidepressant use during pregnancy, but risk of significant blood loss during childbirth is increased Depression and anxiety are commonly treated with SRI drugs that affect brain serotonin metabolism. These drugs are well tolerated and considered safe to use during pregnancy, because they are not seen to cause major malformations. It is estimated that up to 5% of all pregnant women use SRI medication. However, several animal studies have shown that early SRI exposure may result in microscopic changes in fetal brain structure, as well as altered neuronal signaling. The already known side effect of this on human newborns is the transient 'SRI syndrome,' including such symptoms as respiratory problems during the first days of life. In addition, a recent Finnish long-term follow-up study conducted at the Universities of Helsinki and Turku showed that fetal exposure to SRI drugs increases the risk of childhood depression. The present study in Helsinki is the first to examine the effects of SRI exposure directly on the brain activity of newborns. The study design aimed at distinguishing drug-related developmental effects from postnatal, environmental effects, such as potential changes in the mother-baby relationship due to maternal depression. The methodology for the detailed assessment of electrical brain function in newborns has been intensively developed at the BABA center of the Helsinki University Children's Hospital. As a result of this work, it has become possible to examine newborn brain function in detail, and better translate between research on animal models and research on human infants. The study, involving 22 mothers using SRI medication and 62 controls without medication, aimed at assessing how fetal SRI drug exposure or maternal psychiatric symptoms affect newborns' neurological development and their brains' electrical activity. Structured behavioral and neurological assessments of the newborns showed only minor effects from fetal SRI exposure; however, brain electrical activity exhibited several differences between the study groups. The most important relate to less-organized communication between brain hemispheres, as well as weaker synchronization between cortical rhythms. These findings did not correlate with the scores on maternal depression or anxiety. ""The most interesting aspect in our observations is that comparable effects were recently found in animal experiments after fetal SRI exposure,"" says principal investigator Dr. Mari Videman, senior consultant in child neurology. ""This suggests that the early SRI effects on brain development may be comparable in humans and other species."" The study's psychiatric consultant, Adjunct Professor Outi Mantere from McGill University, Canada, emphasizes that pregnant mothers need treatment when they present with symptoms of depression or anxiety. Learn More: Study calls into question link between prenatal antidepressant exposure and autism risk ""The current guidelines do include non-pharmacological therapies as the first-line treatment,"" says Mantere. ""If the mother using an SRI plans a pregnancy, it would be advisable to consider a close follow-up or a therapeutic intervention without SRI medication. Recent experience with group therapy has shown promise in treating depression or anxiety during pregnancy, with effects that extend to the wellbeing of both mother and baby."" ""We hope that our study will facilitate the current international discussion and search for effective alternatives in the treatment of depression and anxiety during pregnancy,"" adds Professor Vanhatalo.

A new University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) study sheds light on the toxicity of the compounds while also suggesting a strategy that may help protect against the disease. The research focused on the fungicide ziram, which is used extensively in heavily agricultural areas such as California's Central Valley and which causes the loss of the main source of dopamine in the central nervous system. Loss of this source, called dopaminergic neurons, is associated with Parkinson's disease. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making The pesticide-linked damage starts with ziram's ability to increase concentrations of a protein, called  -synuclein, which is abundant in the human brain. The  -synuclein proteins then aggregate, or clump together, harming neighboring neurons. This phenomenon also occurs in Parkinson's disease that is not due to pesticide exposures, making it a target for researchers searching for a broad treatment. In this new study, conducted in zebrafish, researchers found that elimination of the  -synuclein protein protected the zebrafish against the ziram-induced loss of dopamine neurons. Because most cases of Parkinson's disease appear to be at least partially caused by environmental factors such as pesticide exposure, these findings support the approach that targeting  -synuclein could slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's in most people with the disease, said study lead author Jeff Bronstein, a professor of neurology and director of movement disorders at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""These findings add to the growing literature linking pesticide exposure and the development of Parkinson's disease and offers important insights into the mechanisms of ziram toxicity,"" Bronstein said. ""A better understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease will ultimately lead to new treatments and eventually a cure."" Related: Parkinson s disease: New insights into a traveling protein The study is published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. First, the researchers developed a model of Parkinson's in zebrafish the first such animal model of the disease and exposed them to ziram so that they lost dopamine. They found that the fish exposed to the ziram did not swim properly, evidence of a Parkinson's-like condition. Then the researchers genetically knocked out the  -synuclein protein in the zebrafish and exposed them to ziram again. The ziram failed to make the fish sick, and the animals continued to swim properly. Next, the researchers gave the non-protected zebrafish an investigational drug, CLRO1, being developed by UCLA scientists that breaks up the protein aggregates, or clumps, in Parkinson's patients. They found that the drug provided protection from the Parkinson's-like condition in the fish. ""Getting rid of the protein genetically or breaking up the aggregates with this drug protected against ziram toxicity,"" Bronstein said. ""This is important - it establishes that environmental toxins work on same pathway that is in play in those genetically disposed to Parkinson's. Most important, we can use drugs being developed now on patients who get Parkinson's because of ziram exposure."" Learn More: Discovery puts designer dopamine neurons within reach Going forward, Bronstein and his team will determine if other environmental substances are using the same mechanism to cause Parkinson's. They will also conduct further research on CLRO1 in preparation for clinical trials in human subjects. About 70 percent of Parkinson's cases cannot be explained by genetics, Bronstein said, so the new finding could be vital to a large percentage of patients whose disease is not genetically caused.

By measuring the electrical activity in the amygdala of patients that had been implanted with electrodes in order to better diagnose their epilepsy, the researchers provide new data on how information travels between the visual and emotional networks. See Also: How the gut feeling shapes fear The amygdala is a brain structure that is part of the limbic system and has a key role when it comes to emotional processing. As opposed to the neocortex, the external part of the brain that covers both hemispheres and hosts most higher cognitive functions in human, such as visual processing or language, the amygdala sits in the internal, or subcortical, part of the brain. ""The amygdala has a privileged spot in the brain, being one of the best connected structures. It sends and receives projections from brain areas at different levels and at the same time is capable of indirectly unleashing physiological changes and autonomic nervous system responses."", explains Constantino M ndez-B rtolo, researcher from the Campus de Excelencia Internacional Moncloa of the Universidad Complutense and the Universidad Polit cnica de Madrid. However, its location deep inside the brain makes it a difficult structure to study with common neuroimaging techniques. In order to better diagnose clinical conditions such as epilepsy, neurosurgeons may implant electrodes in the amygdala. In the study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers relied on the collaboration of eleven patients undergoing such clinical evaluation by Dr. Antonio Gil-Nagel at the Hospital Ruber Internacional (Madrid) with electrodes implanted in this brain area. The analysis of amygdala activity from these patients allowed the researchers to gather the first direct evidence in humans that this area by itself is able to extract information about biologically relevant stimuli in the visual scene very rapidly, before receiving more precise visual input from the neocortex. In order to arrive at this conclusion, the scientists performed two experiments. In the first one, patients had to indicate, by pressing one of two buttons, if the pictures they were being shown (facial expressions of fear, happiness and neutral) pertained to a man or a woman. Learn More: Tracing the scent of fear In addition to emotion, the experimenters also manipulated the spatial frequency of the faces. The authors showed normal photographs (comprising all the frequency bands) mixed with pictures of faces composed of only either low or high spatial frequency components. Low frequency pictures appear like blurry photos - one can distinguish if the eyes or the mouth is open or shut, but cannot appreciate the details - while high frequency pictures have sharp edges and facial features appear highlighted. There are two pathways through which visual information is thought to travel to affective neural circuits. One goes straight from the thalamus to the amygdala. This ""low-road"" is composed of neurons of the magnocellullar class through which only low spatial frequency components are transmitted. The other pathway flows from the thalamus to the occipital cortex, where traditional visual processing begins. This ""high-road"" is composed by magno- as well as parvocellullar neurons, where both high and low spatial frequencies are carried. The authors observed that the amygdala can work with just the coarse visual information within a picture if this picture conveys biologically-relevant information of threat, in this case the expression of fear in another person. ""We started from the hypothesis that, if the amygdala would show a rapid emotional response, this would be larger for the negative emotions and it may occur as long as low spatial frequency components are present in the visual input, as information would arrive from the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus to the amygdala via magnocellullar axons, which do not carry high frequency spatial information"" points out M ndez-B rtolo, one of the main authors. By recording intracranial from the amygdala the researchers were able to detect a very fast electrical response before 100ms to the low frequency components of fearful face stimuli. This was followed by responses (considerably later) in both amygdala and visual cortex to pictures with high or low spatial frequency components. In a second experiment, patients viewed neutral and extremely unpleasant complex visual pictures and indicated whether the picture pertained to an indoor or outdoor scene. The results, compared with the previous experiment where only faces were being shown, indicated that such a fast emotional response was not present for more complex visual stimuli. Related: EEG study findings reveal how fear is processed in the brain This new insight into how information travels between the visual system and emotional networks may help towards a better understanding of pathologies with elevated feelings of fear, such as in phobias and anxiety, where the amygdala is thought to play a fundamental role. ""Our work highlights the importance of ultra-rapid brain responses to threat-related visual stimuli. The responses in the amygdala are so fast that they could reflect an automatic or unconscious visual process, which might explain why fear can sometimes feel out of our voluntary control"", according to Dr. Bryan Strange, from the Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience of the UPM, which led the research with participation from the Basic Psychology I department of the UCM, in collaboration with the University of London (UK), the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and the Reina Sofia Centre for Alzheimer's Research (Madrid).

Now, a new study has uncovered another method by which the gut senses how much food a person eats and relays that to the brain. When the gut senses too many calories, a pathway that promotes the feeling of fullness becomes blocked. The new research iss published in the journal Nutrition & Diabetes. See Also: Obesity is associated with brain s neurotransmitters Through earlier studies on colon cancer, Thomas Jefferson University researchers led by Scott Waldman, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and researcher at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson, noticed that a hormone called uroguanylin also appeared to play a role in obesity. Their studies had shown that in non-obese mice, uroguanylin would travel to the brain, where it produced a feeling of fullness. But it was unclear what happened to this signaling in the obese state. In the current study, the researchers looked at mice who were overfed, and saw that the small intestines of these mice had stopped producing uroguanylin. The receptors for uroguanylin that reside in the brain were intact, and had even increased in number, but hormone itself was no longer being made, suggesting that overeating had caused its production to shut down. However, when the animals were put on a diet, the guanylin production resumed. Learn More: Obesity surgery normalizes brain opioids ""What's interesting,"" said Dr. Waldman, ""is that it didn't matter whether the mice were lean and overfed, or obese and overfed - urogaunylin production stopped in both groups of animals when they got too many calories."" This, says Dr. Waldman, is opposite to what's been observed for other obesity-related hormones like insulin and leptin, which are produced in ever greater quantity as weight increases. ""Here, it's not the obese state that's causing the problem but rather it's the calories,"" he added. To find out how overeating shuts off uroguanylin production, the researchers looked at the cells in the small-intestine that produce the hormone. They suspected that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) might be involved. The ER is an cellular organelle that serves as the production line for many of the body's proteins and hormones, and can stop functioning when it is stressed. When the researchers applied a chemical, tunicamycin, known to cause ER stress, mice stopped producing uroguanylin, much as they did when they were overfed. Finally when overfed, obese, mice were given a chemical that was known to relieve ER stress, the animals once again began producing uroguanylin, suggesting that overfeeding caused the ER stress that in turn shut down uroguanulin production. ""Taken together, these experiments show that excess calories either from fat or carbohydrates stress small intestinal cells so that they stop producing uroguanylin, which helps people feel full after eating,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""What we don't know is how much is too much and what molecular sensor makes that decision."" Related: Obesity and diabetes symptoms in mice improved by reversing brain inflammation ""Like in cancer, there are many steps on the way to becoming obese that aren't easily reversed. While the uroguanylin hormone pathway appears to be one of those steps, we don't yet know whether it's important early on in the process, or later, and how much of a role in plays,"" says Dr. Waldman.

The neck device, called a Q-Collar, is designed to press gently on the jugular vein to slow blood outflow increasing the brain's blood volume. The resulting effect of the increased blood volume helps the brain fit tighter within the skull cavity, reducing the energy absorbed by the brain during collisions. The analysis of neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data from the brain showed athletes in the non-collar wearing group had significant functional and structural changes to white matter regions of the brain but these changes were not evident in those who did wear the Q-Collar during play. See Also: Color-changing polymer may signal traumatic brain injuries in athletes,soldiers ""White matter of the brain essentially connects all the pathways including structure and function. Neuro-radiologists at Cincinnati Children's Hospital established a protocol for how the white matter in the brain is impacted after head collisions and what correlates to a brain injury,"" said Greg Myer, PhD, director of sports medicine research at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Dr. Myer is the lead author of both studies published recently. In the preliminary study published in Frontiers in Neurology | Neurotrauma, 15 hockey players from St. Xavier High School took part. Half wore the collar for the hockey season and the other half did not. Each of the helmets for the athletes was outfitted with an accelerometer to measure every head impact. Results from the imaging and electrophysiological testing indicated that athletes in the non-collar wearing group had a disruption of microstructure and functional performance of the brain. Athletes wearing the collar did not show a significant difference despite similar head impacts. In a follow-up study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, 42 football players from two Greater Cincinnati high schools participated. Twenty-one athletes from St. Xavier High School wore the collar during a competitive season. They were tested before play to make sure the lightweight, c-shaped neck collar fit properly. The other half of athletes participating in the study were from Moeller High School. Those 21 players did not wear the collar. Learn More: High school football helmets offer similar protections despite different prices All of the athletes' helmets were outfitted with an accelerometer which tracked every hit sustained during the pre-and post-season. Researchers used advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to determine the efficacy of the collar to prevent structural changes to the brain following a season of head impacts. The results of this larger study showed similar protective effects of collar wear during the football season. ""The results of the studies demonstrate a potential approach to protecting the brain from changes sustained within a competitive football and hockey season, as evidenced by brain imaging,"" said Dr. Myer. ""We still have more data analysis and investigation to do, but this device could be a real game-changer in helping athletes."" This study follows previously published work by Dr. Myer regarding ""brain slosh"" and theories on how altitude influences concussions in football. Many football-related concussions are believed to occur because the brain doesn't fit tightly in the skull. Cerebral blood flow rises at higher altitudes, causing the brain to fit tighter inside the skull, thus reducing the risk of a concussion. Historical approaches to protect the brain from outside the skull such as helmets have not been effective in reducing internal injury to the brain. David Smith, PhD, co-author in the studies, researched bighorn (head-ramming) sheep and woodpeckers because both animals routinely tolerate high-speed cranium collisions with no adverse impact. A head-on collision between two rams can be 10 times greater than that of two football players; a woodpecker's impact against a tree is 20 times greater. Related: US may be greatly undercounting pediatric concussionsThe migration patterns of head-ramming sheep show they are hitting at high altitudes. With woodpeckers, they have a long tongue that wraps around the top of their head lassoing the jugular vein, which increases blood volume creating a natural bubble wrap to keep the brain from sloshing.

When transplanted into rats with hypopituitarism a disease linked to dwarfism and premature aging in humans the lab-grown pituitary cells promoted normal hormone release. The study, which lays the foundation for future preclinical work, appears in Stem Cell Reports. See Also: Stem cells from teeth can make brain-like cells ""The current treatment options for patients suffering from hypopituitarism, a dysfunction of the pituitary gland, are far from optimal,"" says first study author Bastian Zimmer of the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. ""Cell replacement could offer a more permanent therapeutic option with pluripotent stem cell-derived hormone-producing cells that functionally integrate and respond to positive and negative feedback from the body. Achieving such a long-term goal may lead to a potential cure, not only a treatment, for those patients."" The pituitary gland is the master regulator of hormone production in the body, releasing hormones that play a key role in bone and tissue growth, metabolism, reproductive functions, and the stress response. Hypopituitarism can be caused by tumors, genetic defects, brain trauma, immune and infectious diseases, or radiation therapy. The consequences of pituitary dysfunction are wide ranging and particularly serious in children, who can suffer severe learning disabilities, growth and skeletal problems, as well as effects on puberty and sexual function. Currently, patients with hypopituitarism must take expensive, lifelong hormone replacement therapies that poorly mimic the body's complex patterns of hormone secretion that fluctuates with circadian rhythms and responds to feedback from other organs. By contrast, cell replacement therapies hold promise for permanently restoring natural patterns of hormone secretion while avoiding the need for costly, lifelong treatments. Don't Miss: Large doses of antioxidants may be harmful to neuronal stem cells Recently, scientists developed a procedure for generating pituitary cells from human pluripotent stem cells an unlimited cell source for regenerative medicine using organoid cultures that mimic the 3D organization of the developing pituitary gland. However, this approach is inefficient and complicated, relies on ill-defined cellular signals, lacks reproducibility, and is not scalable or suitable for clinical-grade cell manufacturing. To address these limitations, Zimmer and senior study author Lorenz Studer of the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research developed a simple, efficient, and robust stem cell-based strategy for reliably producing a large number of diverse, functional pituitary cell types suitable for therapeutic use. Instead of mimicking the complex 3D organization of the developing pituitary gland, this approach relies on the precisely timed exposure of human pluripotent stem cells to a few specific cellular signals that are known to play an important role during embryonic development. Exposure to these proteins triggered the stem cells to turn into different types of functional pituitary cells that released hormones important for bone and tissue growth (i.e., growth hormone), the stress response (i.e., adrenocorticotropic hormone), and reproductive functions (i.e., prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone). Moreover, these stem cell-derived cells released different amounts of hormone in response to known feedback signals generated by other organs in the body. To test the therapeutic potential of this approach, the researchers transplanted the stem cell-derived pituitary cells under the skin of rats whose pituitary gland had been surgical removed. The cell grafts not only secreted adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, and follicle-stimulating hormone, but they also triggered appropriate hormonal responses in the kidneys. The researchers were also able to control the relative composition of different hormonal cell types simply by exposing human pluripotent stem cells to different ratios of two proteins: fibroblast growth factor 8 and bone morphogenetic protein 2. This finding suggests their approach could be tailored to generate specific cell types for patients with different types of hypopituitarism. ""For the broad application of stem cell-derived pituitary cells in the future, cell replacement therapy may need to be customized to the specific needs of a given patient population,"" Zimmer says. Learn More: Human stem cell-derived neuron transplants reduce seizures in mice In future studies, the researchers plan to further improve the protocol to generate pure populations of various hormone-releasing cell types, enabling the production of grafts that are tailored to the needs of individual patients. They will also test this approach on more clinically relevant animal models that have pituitary damage caused by radiation therapy and receive grafts in or near the pituitary gland rather than under the skin. This research could have important implications for cancer survivors, given that hypopituitarism is one of the main causes of poor quality of life after brain radiation therapy. ""Our findings represent a first step in treating hypopituitarism, but that does not mean the disease will be cured permanently within the near future,"" Zimmer says. ""However, our work illustrates the promise of human pluripotent stem cells as it presents a direct path toward realizing the promise of regenerative medicine for certain hormonal disorders.""

They are mainly by-products of combustion and industrial processes. Long-term exposure to dioxins has been suspected to have a host of toxicities, causing health issues such as cancer and impairment of the immune system and the developing nervous system. See Also: How neurons get their branching shapes In the body, dioxin readily forms a complex with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor protein whose real function has yet to be clarified. The manifestations of dioxin toxicities require AhR. It was previously shown that adult rodents born to mice exposed to dioxins during pregnancy display cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. However, the underlying mechanisms of such manifestations have remained unclear. In search of an answer, researchers centered at University of Tsukuba in Japan studied the possible effects of excessive activation of AhR signaling a phenomenon thought to mimic the exposure of AhR to dioxins on neurodevelopmental processes in mice, such as cellular migration and neurite growth. Their work is published in Scientific Reports.  We speculate that disrupted AhR signaling is the underlying mechanism of dioxin s developmental neurotoxicity,  co-author Eiki Kimura says.  Indeed, we found that excessive activation of AhR signaling slowed the migration of neurons from their origin to their final position in the brain, which is a critical process for normal brain development.  Notably, the migrations are regulated by several proteins whose expression levels are altered by AhR signaling activation. Learn More: Researchers observe brain development in uteroThe findings provide evidence of the pivotal role of AhR signaling in neuronal differentiation and maturation in the developing brain, and clarify how its interaction with harmful chemicals, such as dioxins, can lead to behavioral and developmental alterations.

ERDG has the goal of developing partnerships with existing commercial synthetic bait manufacturers for the development of an alternative bait to reduce the utilization of Limulus polyphemus as a lure in the United States conch and eel fisheries (900,000-1,000,000 annually) and potentially to relieve pressure on the same species in its southern most range (Yucatan Peninsula) from illegal harvesting as bait in the Mexican octopus fishery. As part of this work, ERDG has developed bait-saving gear such as bait bags, which reduce secondary predation of the bait, thereby extending its time in use. From 2000-2004, ERDG manufactured and distributed free of charge more than 15,000 bait bags to conch fishermen along the Atlantic Coast, which resulted in a 50% reduction in the harvest of horseshoe crabs there. In 2015 ERDG launched The Horseshoe Crab Teacher Toolbox, an online library for educators from around the world to share lesson plans, print materials and audio-visual resources. (http://horseshoecrab.org/teacher-toolbox/)   Horseshoe crabs have an important role to play in the pharmaceutical industry for endotoxin testing. Endotoxins that are associated with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can elicit a number of undesirable pyrogenic effects in humans and animals, including septic shock, fever, vascular collapse and even death. As such, it is vital to screen pharmaceuticals such as vaccines, implantable medical devices, and intravenous drugs and fluids for endotoxin contamination before they are administered to patients. Allen Burgenson, Regulatory Affairs Manager Lonza Bioscience, is a Biomedical Industry Representative on the Advisory Committee of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) for the horseshoe crab, which promotes and assures the preservation of the horseshoe crabs. He commented,  At Lonza we are aware of the importance of the horseshoe crab, not only for its contribution to ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, but also its ecological role. We are committed to employing best practices when handling the horseshoe crabs used in the manufacturing of LAL, including returning them to the same waters from which they are taken. We have also developed the PyroGene  method, a synthetic, recombinant alternative to LAL that does not rely on horseshoe crabs as a source. This method reduces our reliance on this important natural resource and reduces the risk of supply issues to assure the safety of pharmaceuticals  Glen Gauvry, President of ERDG, said,  This sponsorship from Lonza is a clear demonstration of ERDG s belief that environmental stewardship can thrive within a growing economy through healthy partnerships between industry, government, environmental groups and communities. This money will directly enable us to achieve our aims on key projects. ","Published: June 15, 2016"

The vaccine, Vaxchora, is the only approved vaccine in the U.S. for protection against cholera. Its licensure allows for use in people traveling to regions in which cholera is common, including travelers, humanitarian aid workers, and the military. PaxVax, a global biotechnology company based in California, received marketing approval from the FDA for Vaxchora, a single-dose oral, live attenuated cholera vaccine that is indicated for use in adults 18 to 64 years of age. Vaxchora is the only vaccine available in the U.S. for protection against cholera and the only single-dose vaccine for cholera currently licensed anywhere in the world. The vaccine was invented in the 1980s at Center for Vaccine Development (CVD). Since 2009, CVD researchers have worked closely with PaxVax to develop the vaccine and secure FDA licensure approval.  This important FDA decision is the culmination of years of dedicated work by many researchers,  said Myron M. Levine, MD, DTPH, the Simon and Bessie Grollman Distinguished Professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM).  For travelers to the many parts of the world where cholera transmission is occurring and poses a potential risk, this vaccine helps protect them from this disease. It is a wonderful example of how public-private partnerships can develop medicines from bench to bedside.  Dr. Levine is co-inventor of the vaccine, along with James B. Kaper, PhD, Professor and Chairman of the UM SOM Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and the senior associate dean for academic affairs at the school. Cholera is an acute intestinal diarrheal infection acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water. Globally, cholera cases have increased steadily since 2005 and, millions of people are affected by this disease each year. Cholera can cause severe dehydration and death in less than 24 hours, if left untreated. While some cholera cases are rarely acquired in the U.S. from ingestion of uncooked seafood from the Gulf of Mexico, the vast majority of cases of domestic cholera cases occur in travelers to areas with epidemic or endemic cholera (for example, parts of Africa, Asia, or the Caribbean). A report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the true number of cholera cases in the U.S. is at least 30 times higher than observed by national surveillance systems. The currently recommended intervention to prevent infection is to avoid contaminated water and food. But studies have shown that 98 percent of travelers do not follow these precautions. Vaxchora is expected to be commercially available later this year. The FDA approval is based on results from a phase 1 safety and immunogenicity trial, a phase 3 efficacy trial, and a phase 3 trial to test manufacturing consistency. The first two of these trials were led by Wilbur H. Chen, MD, MS, associate professor of medicine at UM SOM, and chief of the CVD s Adult Clinical Studies section. The pivotal efficacy trial, which demonstrated protection from cholera of more than 90 percent at 10 days and 80 percent at 3 months after vaccination, is the first instance the FDA has based the decision to approve a product on a human experimental challenge model. Therefore, the licensure of Vaxchora marks a significant regulatory milestone. The most common adverse reactions to Vaxchora in the clinical trials were tiredness, headache, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, lack of appetite and diarrhea. Cholera is chiefly a disease of poverty, poor sanitation, and lack of access to safe drinking water, so the global health burden of cholera rests on those populations residing in vulnerable developing countries. The World Health Organization estimates the burden of cholera to be between 1.4 and 4.3 million cases per year globally. Dr. Chen said that the next steps for this cholera vaccine are to explore formulations that could be developed into successful strategies to prevent and control cholera in countries where cholera is common. These future activities would involve immunizing young children in developing countries; this group has the highest risk of dying from cholera.  The FDA approval of a new vaccine for a disease for which there has been no vaccine available is an extremely rare event. The approval of Vaxchora is an important milestone for PaxVax and we are proud to provide the only vaccine against cholera available in the U.S.,  said Nima Farzan, chief executive officer and president of PaxVax.  We worked closely with the FDA on the development of Vaxchora and credit the agency s priority review program for accelerating the availability of this novel vaccine. In line with our social mission, we have also begun development programs focused on bringing this vaccine to additional populations such as children and people living in countries affected by cholera.   This approval is an excellent example of how our researchers are entering into public-private partnerships to help further science in tangible ways,  said UM SOM Dean E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, who is also the vice president for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor.  This vaccine shows once again that work by scientists here has an impact not only nationally, but globally. ","Published: June 15, 2016"

Genomic analysis involves reading the complete genetic instructions of the pathogens causing a disease, and using that data to infer who might have infected whom. By looking for mutations that are shared between the pathogens taken from different people, researchers can see whose pathogens are most closely related to each other, suggesting potential transmission.  Declaring the end of a TB outbreak is a difficult thing to do,  said senior author Jennifer Gardy, assistant professor in UBC s school of population and public health and a senior scientist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control.  Because the bacterium that causes TB can lie dormant in someone s lung for months or even years before it causes disease, we had no way of knowing whether a TB case we have just diagnosed was a recent infection   suggesting the outbreak is still going on   or whether the person was infected years ago.  Using mathematical and statistical techniques, the researchers evaluated a TB outbreak that began in May 2008 and were able to determine when each outbreak case was infected. This provided public health officials with a way to determine when disease transmission had stopped and the outbreak had ended. They were able to declare the outbreak over in January 2015, after the data indicated no disease transmission had occurred since mid-2012.  By using a series of techniques from the world of mathematics and statistics, we can come up with an estimated time at which each infection occurred,  explained Gardy.  This information is incredibly useful to the public health officials managing an outbreak. Responding to an outbreak requires a lot of effort and resources, and we need to know when we can step down our response.   Genomics has been used to monitor infectious disease outbreaks before, but this is the first time it s ever been possible to declare a complicated outbreak of TB over,  said Gardy.  It really opens up new doors in the world of TB control. ","Published: June 15, 2016"

Data from the study, to be reported June 16 in the online journal mBio, provide new evidence that microbes influence a wine s terroir, or the wine s distinctive regional characteristics. The study also suggests that such microbial signatures associated with predictable chemical profiles of wine might provide a valuable new quality-control tool for the multibillion-dollar global wine industry.  To our knowledge, the microbial communities associated with harvested grapes have never before been used to predict the qualities of the finished wine in this fashion,  said co-author David Mills, a professor of food science and technology.  This could present a whole new paradigm for ensuring quality of wine and many other agricultural products.  He noted that the study also suggests that there may be economic incentives for using sustainable practices to protect regional microbial biodiversity in many different agricultural areas.  In other words, if your region or winery is producing a high-quality product, you might want to know that your favorite microbial partners are showing up every year,  Mills said. Winemaker and study co-author Greg Allen of Far Niente and Nickel & Nickel wineries said that the study provided powerful tools for characterizing the microbial ecologies inhabiting the wineries  vineyards and the persistence of those microbial influences through the winemaking process.  Our eyes have been opened to the fact that microbial ecologies and metabolic products arise with unique patterns across our various vineyards, and that vineyard-specific conditions form the basis for this,  Allen said.  It s exciting for us to know that fungi and bacteria are important determinants of terroir, which, in turn, is inspiring for continued study,  he said. Building on microbial terroir discoveries In a 2013 study, Mills and colleagues demonstrated that different California grape-growing regions have distinct, identifiable microbial patterns that are correlated with the grape variety, as well as local weather conditions and geography. They suggested that these microbial populations are part of wine s terroir. In the newly published study, the researchers explored whether such distinct microbial patterns might even distinguish adjacent growing regions as well as individual vineyards and wineries within a single growing region. They also examined whether those microbial patterns were associated with the chemical products that result from the fermentation process. Chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon examined At Far Niente and Nickel & Nickel wineries, the researchers collected nearly 700 samples of grape musts, or crushed grapes, and wine during various stages of fermenting and aging for cabernet sauvignon, a dry red wine, and chardonnay, a dry white wine. The two wineries are located 2 km (less than 1.5 miles) apart in the Napa Valley community of Oakville, and the samples were derived from grapes grown throughout Napa and Sonoma counties.  We have long believed that site selection is crucial to what makes our vineyards special towards achieving our wine style goals, whether they be single-vineyard wines or blends,  said winemaker Allen.  Through our viticultural and winemaking practices, we have learned to make the most of our various vineyard sites.  Allen noted that the understanding of site microenvironment has historically focused on measurements of geological makeup and soil composition, together with observations of topology, site orientation and local weather patterns. However, the diversity and biological contributions of the microbial communities intrinsic to the wineries  vineyards have been far less understood, he said. Initial microbes might serve as wine quality biomarkers Analyses of the samples in the new study indicated that the microbes in the grape musts were associated with specific chemical products in the finished wines, suggesting that the microbes could serve as biomarkers for predicting the chemical composition of wines. Such biomarkers could be useful in predicting whether specific vineyard sites might be suitable for producing certain wines and also for preventing microbial issues during abnormal vintages, such as those that might result from poor weather during harvest. The researchers emphasize, however, that such biomarkers probably could not be used to artificially mimic the many complex factors involved with wine terroir. Microbial terroir and other agricultural products  Wine is an incredibly useful model for testing the concept of microbial terroir, and it is possible that there are similar relationships between regional microbial patterns and the final quality of other agricultural products,  Mills said. He added that further studies are needed to confirm whether the microbial communities are merely associated with the chemical composition of the finished wine or if those microbes actually cause changes that result in specific flavors, aromas and other important sensory qualities of wine.","Published: June 15, 2016"

The new approach might be used to create arrays of hundreds of sensors on an electronic chip, each sensor detecting a specific type of bacteria or pinpointing the effectiveness of particular antibiotics within minutes. ""We have taken a step toward this long-term goal by showing how to distinguish between live and dead bacteria,"" said Muhammad Ashraful Alam, Purdue University's Jai N. Gupta Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. ""This is important because you need to be able to not only detect and identify bacteria, but to determine which antibiotics are effective in killing them."" Findings are detailed in a research paper appearing this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper was authored by doctoral student Aida Ebrahimi and Alam. The droplet sensor evolved from a device originally designed to detect small concentrations of negatively charged DNA molecules in research that began about four years ago, Ebrahimi said. ""We did not anticipate that the sensor could be used to tell live and dead bacteria apart   it was a chance observation that eventually led us to this elegant way of measuring cell viability,"" she said. As described in the PNAS paper, the sensor works by detecting changes in electrical conductivity in droplets containing bacteria cells. ""To see if someone is alive,"" Alam said, ""we can either count the grandchildren many generations later, which is analogous to the traditional growth-based techniques. Or, we can directly measure the person's pulse, analogous to the proposed 'osmoregulation-based' detection of bacteria. Needless to say, immediate physiological measurement is faster and far superior."" Bacteria cells maintain the proper internal pressure through osmoregulation, a process in which water, salts and other molecules move across the cell membrane. As a droplet begins to evaporate on the sensor, bacteria cells contained in the droplet detect the increasingly salty environment, triggering emergency valves called osmoregulatory transporters in the cell membrane. The cells then either take in or release water and charged molecules including salts, changing the electrical conductivity of the surrounding fluid in the droplet, which is measured by electrodes. This change in electrical conductivity varies according to whether a bacteria cell is dead or alive and also might be used to identify specific types of bacteria because they use fundamentally different osmoregulatory channels. ""Aida proved the hypothesis by using genetically mutated cells that do not have those osmoregulatory channels and therefore are less effective in regulating the pressure differential,"" Alam said. The sensor's surface was designed specifically to maintain the shape of a droplet, which is critical for the technology to work. Two other advances making the sensor possible are the ability to measure the changing electrical conductivity in the droplet and harnessing a cell s osmoregulation as the basis for detection. ""In the end you want to provide a new tool for medicine and food safety, so you need to be able to quickly identify bacteria and the right antibiotics to treat infection,"" Alam said. ""That requires an understanding of the dynamics of the cell membrane."" The technology, which was tested with low concentrations of living and dead forms of E. coli, Salmonella and S. epidermidis bacteria, is said to be label-free because it does not require that samples be treated with fluorescent dyes, making it a potentially practical tool for medicine and food safety. Much of the research was performed at the Birck Nanotechnology Center and Bindley Bioscience Center in Purdue's Discovery Park.","Published: June 15, 2016"

Researchers at EPFL have now found a way to reclaim the corrupted immune cells, turn them into signals for the immune system to attack the tumor, and even prevent metastasis. Macrophages are cells of the immune system that protect the host from invading pathogens. But in cancer, macrophages can be  hijacked  by tumors, and made to support their malignant growth and spread. This is a drawback for a major cancer treatment, immunotherapy, which turns the body s immune system against the tumor. EPFL scientists, working with colleagues at the Roche Innovation Centers in Munich and Basel, have now identified a molecular  switch  that can convert the  hijacked  macrophages into cells that can stimulate the immune system to fight the growth and spread of cancer. The work is published in Nature Cell Biology.  Traitor  macrophages Along with attacking foreign pathogens like bacteria, macrophages also help the body s organs develop and its wounds heal. Their own behavior is fine-tuned by small molecules that they produce, called microRNAs.  When a tumor begins to develop, macrophages attempt to block its growth. But often tumors hijack them and convert them into what are known as  tumor-associated macrophages , or TAMs for short. Now corrupted, TAMs use their microRNAs to shield the tumor from the patient s immune system, helping it grow and metastasize. This phenomenon is common across many tumor types. It is one of the major obstacles in treating cancer, and often leads to a poor prognosis for the patient. Reprogramming macrophages Michele De Palma s team at EPFL found how to reclaim TAMs. The researchers genetically modified TAMs to remove their ability to produce microRNAs. As a result, the TAMs were reprogrammed dramatically. Instead of protecting the tumor, the TAMs now signaled the presence of the tumor to the immune system, triggering attacks against it   and did so very efficiently. Using a bioinformatics approach, the researchers found that the most likely culprit was a small family of microRNAs, called Let-7. This offers a more specific target: blocking Let-7 microRNAs may help instruct the TAMs to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, the researchers observed that reprogramming TAMs also stops cancer cells from leaving the primary tumor. This could mean that the approach can also prevent tumor metastasis, the most threatening aspect of cancer. Moreover, the researchers found that the re-educated TAMs could enhance the anti-tumoral efficacy of certain cancer immunotherapies, some of which are already approved for patients. However, more work is needed to translate all these findings to actual therapies, especially since there is currently no way to block the Let-7 microRNAs selectively in TAMs. But De Palma s lab is now working with bioengineers at EPFL to design drugs that can target the Let-7 microRNAs specifically in the TAMs. Therapeutic opportunities Some of the most promising cancer treatments are immunotherapies, which are based on provoking or enhancing the patient s immune response against their tumor.  The most exciting finding was that TAM reprogramming greatly improved the efficacy of immunotherapy,  says Michele De Palma.  Our results in experimental models of cancer suggest a new therapeutic strategy based on inhibiting the microRNA machinery   or the Let-7 microRNAs   specifically in the TAMs, which may unleash the power of mainstream immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors . The first authors of the study are Caroline Baer, who recently obtained her PhD from the Doctoral Program in Biotechnology and Bioengineering (EDBB), and Mario Leonardo Squadrito, senior post-doc, both in De Palma s lab. The study involves a collaboration of EPFL s Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) with the Roche Centers for Innovation at Basel and Munich.

The standard of care for detecting such blood-borne infections is blood culture, but this takes days to complete, only identifies pathogens in less than 30% of patients with fulminant infections, and it is not able to detect toxic fragments of dead pathogens that also drive the exaggerated inflammatory reactions leading to sepsis. Biomarkers that report elevated inflammation are used clinically in the treatment of patients with sepsis; however, they fail to distinguish inflammation triggered by infectious pathogens from that induced by non-infectious causes, such as burns, traumas and surgeries. Now, a Wyss Institute team led by Donald Ingber reports inn eBioMedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy. The potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study, whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysis-like sepsis therapies. ""Our pathogen detection technology solves both dilemmas: it quickly reports whether infectious pathogens are present in the body, even at early stages of infection before sepsis develops. And it can more specifically identify patients who have excessive inflammation due to systemic infection, rather than other causes,"" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., the Wyss Institute s Founding Director, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""This assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area, and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics, helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibiotic-resistant organisms."" ""In a cohort of emergency room patients with suspected sepsis, we saw that the assay picked up infection within an hour in 85% of patients who exhibited clinical symptoms of sepsis, and equally importantly, it did not falsely predict infection in healthy subjects or patients with inflammation triggered by other causes, such as trauma. On the other hand, blood cultures that we performed in parallel using the same samples only detected pathogens in 18% of the cases,"" said Nathan Shapiro, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Translational Research in the Center for Vascular Biology Research at BIDMC, who worked with Ingber s team to conduct the clinical study. ""This highlights the advance this technology represents."" The diagnostic assay is built on FcMBL, a genetically engineered pathogen-binding protein previously developed by Ingber and Michael Super, a Wyss Senior Staff Scientist who co-leads the Institute s pathogen-detecting effort. FcMBL binds to pathogens and pathogen-released fragments, known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) by recognizing carbohydrate molecules on their surface. Previous efforts in Ingber s team at the Wyss Institute have established FcMBL as a key component of an advanced dialysis-like, pathogen-extracting therapeutic device, and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities. ""In our latest work, we show that the FcMBL-based pathogen-detecting assay is considerably faster and more accurate than any other available assay for systemic infection. We are currently working to ready it for high-throughput use in clinical and point of care situations and to accelerate it even further,"" said Mark Cartwright, Ph.D., a Staff Scientist at the Wyss Institute and a lead-author on the study. As a prerequisite to their clinical study, the Wyss Institute s team had successfully tested the assay in rat and pig models of infection with pathogenic E. coli bacteria. ""The animal models clearly told us that the assay can sensitively trace spikes of PAMPs released during antibiotic therapy, or residual infectious PAMP materials, even when no living bacteria circulate anymore in blood but they remain hidden inside internal organs. Thus, this assay could be an excellent tool for monitoring ongoing infection and responses to antibiotics and dialysis-like therapies for severe infections and sepsis,"" said Mike Super, Ph.D. Together, the findings suggest that the FcMBL-based pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time, high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infection-causing pathogens could provide a real-world advance to diagnose life-threatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and point-of-care settings.

In the 21st century, it s still a formidable killer. According the World Health Organization, 1.5 million people died of TB in 2014; of those, about 480,000 had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is resistant to at least 2 of the most potent TB drugs available. The bacterium that causes TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), can withstand attacks by antibacterial drugs through a variety of mechanisms. Because of this resilience, TB drug therapy can stretch for months or even years, involve numerous drugs with harsh side effects, and still fail to cure the disease. Researchers have been trying to understand how Mtb dodges drug attacks. They could use this knowledge to help predict which drugs or drug combinations are most likely to overcome the bug s evasive maneuvers. In previous work, scientists mapped the gene regulatory network in Mtb. In this study, researchers used this network model to investigate how Mtb can become tolerant to the relatively new anti-TB drug bedaquiline. The Seattle-based team was led by Dr. Nitin Baliga at the Institute for Systems Biology and Dr. David Sherman at the Center for Infectious Disease Research. The study was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It appeared online in Nature Microbiology on June 6, 2016. The team found that more than 1,100 genes were expressed differently in Mtb treated with bedaquiline compared to untreated bacteria. Using network analysis, the researchers pinpointed 2 key regulatory genes whose activation appeared to coordinate the changes that drive Mtb into a drug-tolerant state. When either of these genes was disrupted, the bacteria were once again susceptible to the drug in laboratory experiments. Based on their system-wide understanding of how Mtb responds to bedaquiline, the researchers predicted which drug would be effective to use in combination with bedaquiline. The anti-TB drug pretomanid inhibits 1 of the 2 key gene networks activated by bedaquiline. In laboratory experiments, the team found that when pretomanid was used with bedaquiline the drugs acted synergistically to kill TB bacteria. The drug combination is already being tested in several clinical trials, the researchers note. Their gene network analysis approach has helped illuminate the mechanism behind the combination s effectiveness.  The incredibly large number of possible drug combinations taken together with the difficulty of growing Mtb in the laboratory make discovery of effective combination therapy extremely challenging,"" Baliga says. ""We hope that our systems-based strategy will accelerate TB drug discovery by helping researchers prioritize combinations that are more likely to be effective. ","Published: June 15, 2016"

Through the ages with van Leeuwenhoek, Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, the 19th century scientist who found that microorganisms could cause disease, human awareness of the microbial world and its importance has expanded to help underpin critical medical and agricultural discoveries, such as antibiotics and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, as well as to make us masters of the organisms that enrich our lives and diets through ordinary bread and wine. In more recent years, microbes have proved their worth through things like polymerase chain reaction, a now common method to amplify DNA in the lab, in forensics and in medicine. The process depends on an enzyme from a bacterium retrieved from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park in the 1960s and fuels billions of dollars in economic activity annually. In addition, the re-tasking of a natural microbial immune system, CRISPR, has enabled precise genome editing from microbes to plants and animals. Now, seeking to further harness microbes  many uses, the federal government has launched the National Microbiome Initiative (NMI) to  foster the integrated study of microbiomes across different ecosystems.  Microbiomes are defined as communities of microorganisms that live on or in people (and other animals), plants, soil, oceans and the atmosphere. The initiative will put us in a position to better understand microbes in context and how they work, explains University of Wisconsin Madison bacteriology Professor Timothy Donohue. Its resources will depend much on the next federal budget, but various funding agencies as well as private organizations have committed to finding new support to enhance budgets for work related to the initiative.  It is a scientific fact that  microbes touch everything,  from the food we eat, the air we breathe and the water we drink,  says Donohue.  They are the master chemists of the universe, responsible for the world around us, and are intimately linked to the future health and evolution of the planet and its inhabitants.  UW-Madison, Donohue argues, has both strengths and challenges in terms of capitalizing on the initiative.  Wisconsin has a history of and currently benefits by having many of the global thought leaders in microbiology,  he says.  However, to realize the potential of the NMI, we can benefit from leaders from disciplines who traditionally have not worked in the microbial sciences.  In addition to strong programs in microbiology, he lists Wisconsin s disciplinary breadth and long history of interdisciplinary research as assets. Researchers in fields such as chemistry, engineering, business and ethics will work to demystify microbiomes, how they function and how they might be exploited for the benefit of human health, food and energy production, environmental remediation and basic discovery. A challenge, he says, will be aligning the technologies necessary to be successful in what is sure to be a competitive market for both capital and intellectual resources.  There are major technology areas of need in this arena, including data analysis, modeling, imaging, technology development, biodesign, materials science, biomanufacturing and others,  Donohue says.  Some of these are common to this initiative and others, so there is intense national and international competition for leaders in these emerging areas.   (Microbes) are the master chemists of the universe, responsible for the world around us, and are intimately linked to the future health and evolution of the planet and its inhabitants.  Trina McMahon, a UW Madison professor of bacteriology and civil and environmental engineering, is cautiously optimistic about the national microbiome push, if for no other reason than it puts a spotlight on a corner of biology that is only now wending its way into public consciousness.  The buzz is awesome,  she says.  Bringing the spotlight to the microbiome generally lets people know it s not just about the gut microbiome,  an area that has received notoriety due mostly to its implications for human health. McMahon studies microbial ecology in freshwater systems such as Lake Mendota and in the sludge processed at wastewater treatment plants. Her group is particularly interested in organisms that store phosphorus, a chemical nutrient and pollutant that helps spur the lake s epic algae blooms. At UW Madison, exploration of the microbiome is occurring in many different labs and contexts, ranging from surveys of the microbiomes of the bat wing, copepods and Lake Michigan algae to the gut microbiomes of the Wisconsin high school class of 1957 as part of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). Bacteriologist Federico Rey, who helps lead the WLS microbiome effort, is excited about the national push, but is naturally concerned about the competition.  I think it is really exciting to see how much interest there is in this field. Funding for this kind of research is going up, but it is nerve-wracking to see how much money other universities are putting into it. How is the University of Wisconsin going to compete?  Wisconsin s strengths, he says, reside in breadth of expertise,  a collaborative spirit and fantastic students.  But to be successful in a big way will require bringing all of those things and associated technologies   rapid gene sequencing, bioinformatics, computational resources and biologists   together to solve big problems. The microbiome can also be a powerful teaching opportunity. Melissa Christopherson, a faculty associate in the Department of Bacteriology, took her microbiology capstone students on a tour of the microbiome of the human mouth this past semester, comparing the oral microbiomes of student athletes to see if there were differences in the microbial communities in elite athletes compared to others and if diet had an influence on the microbial cast of characters. The project s findings are now being prepared for publication.  One of the aims of this initiative is education,  says Christopherson, who was on hand for the May 13 White House summit where the initiative was announced by Jo Handelsman, a former UW Madison professor of bacteriology and now associate director for science in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  There are only one or two examples of a course like this around the country,  Christopherson notes.  The students in this course got their money s worth. They worked their butts off. A project like this is a way to summarize a lot of the things they ve learned.  The initiative rests on the growing array of technologies that make the sequencing and analysis of genetic material cheap and easy, says civil and environmental engineering Professor Dan Noguera. Most microorganisms can t be cultured in the lab, but they can be cracked open and their genetic material can be plumbed with growing speed and accuracy.  We re able to do things we weren t able to do 10 or 12 years ago,  says Noguera, who uses a Madison sewage treatment plant as a laboratory.  There are some very sophisticated tools and models, but only a few people are good at using them and interpreting them, so the hope is there will be some synergy.  One potential upshot of the initiative, he observes, is the opportunity for the development of centers on the scale of the Department of Energy s Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, a collaboration of UW Madison and Michigan State University whose mission is to develop the next generation of biofuels.","Published: June 15, 2016"

(Purdue University photo/Aida Ebrahimi) A new type of electronic sensor that might be used to quickly detect and classify bacteria for medical diagnostics and food safety has passed a key hurdle by distinguishing between dead and living bacteria cells. Conventional laboratory technologies require that samples be cultured for hours or longer to grow enough of the bacteria for identification and analysis, for example, to determine which antibiotic to prescribe. The new approach might be used to create arrays of hundreds of sensors on an electronic chip, each sensor detecting a specific type of bacteria or pinpointing the effectiveness of particular antibiotics within minutes. ""We have taken a step toward this long-term goal by showing how to distinguish between live and dead bacteria,"" said Muhammad Ashraful Alam, Purdue University's Jai N. Gupta Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. ""This is important because you need to be able to not only detect and identify bacteria, but to determine which antibiotics are effective in killing them."" Findings are detailed in a research paper appearing this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper was authored by doctoral student Aida Ebrahimi and Alam. The droplet sensor evolved from a device originally designed to detect small concentrations of negatively charged DNA molecules in research that began about four years ago, Ebrahimi said. ""We did not anticipate that the sensor could be used to tell live and dead bacteria apart   it was a chance observation that eventually led us to this elegant way of measuring cell viability,"" she said. As described in the PNAS paper, the sensor works by detecting changes in electrical conductivity in droplets containing bacteria cells. (A YouTube video about the research is available at https://youtu.be/QN019bQJCb8). ""To see if someone is alive,"" Alam said, ""we can either count the grandchildren many generations later, which is analogous to the traditional growth-based techniques. Or, we can directly measure the person's pulse, analogous to the proposed 'osmoregulation-based' detection of bacteria. Needless to say, immediate physiological measurement is faster and far superior."" Bacteria cells maintain the proper internal pressure through osmoregulation, a process in which water, salts and other molecules move across the cell membrane. As a droplet begins to evaporate on the sensor, bacteria cells contained in the droplet detect the increasingly salty environment, triggering emergency valves called osmoregulatory transporters in the cell membrane. The cells then either take in or release water and charged molecules including salts, changing the electrical conductivity of the surrounding fluid in the droplet, which is measured by electrodes. This change in electrical conductivity varies according to whether a bacteria cell is dead or alive and also might be used to identify specific types of bacteria because they use fundamentally different osmoregulatory channels. ""Aida proved the hypothesis by using genetically mutated cells that do not have those osmoregulatory channels and therefore are less effective in regulating the pressure differential,"" Alam said. The sensor's surface was designed specifically to maintain the shape of a droplet, which is critical for the technology to work. Two other advances making the sensor possible are the ability to measure the changing electrical conductivity in the droplet and harnessing a cell s osmoregulation as the basis for detection. ""In the end you want to provide a new tool for medicine and food safety, so you need to be able to quickly identify bacteria and the right antibiotics to treat infection,"" Alam said. ""That requires an understanding of the dynamics of the cell membrane."" The technology, which was tested with low concentrations of living and dead forms of E. coli, Salmonella and S. epidermidis bacteria, is said to be label-free because it does not require that samples be treated with fluorescent dyes, making it a potentially practical tool for medicine and food safety. Much of the research was performed at the Birck Nanotechnology Center and Bindley Bioscience Center in Purdue's Discovery Park. The researchers have received a provisional patent on the concept through the Purdue Research Foundation's Office of Technology Commercialization. This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (Award number 1403582). In addition, Ebrahimi is supported by a Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship Award from Purdue.","Published: June 15, 2016"

However, current immunisation programmes use attenuated  live  or  killed  virus vaccines, both of which carry a risk of live virus escaping back into the wild. Now, Professor George Lomonossoff, of The John Innes Centre, is part of a University of Leeds-led research project  Generation of Virus Free Polio Vaccine ; the project aims to develop ways of constructing vaccines without using the live virus and exploring different methods for their production. This grant from the World Health Organisation will fund the next phase of the study to find out which technique is most suitable for large-scale manufacture and world-wide distribution. Professor David Rowlands, of the University of Leeds  Faculty of Biological Sciences, who leads the project together with Professor Nicola Stonehouse, said:   We know that our approaches create stable vaccines that are effective against the virus in the lab. The next stage is to show how they can be manufactured cost effectively on the scale needed to replace the current vaccines. The fundamental challenge is to build protein shells that are the same as the virus  but that do not have any of the genetic material of the virus.  Until now, the problem with this approach to developing a new polio vaccine has been that, though we ve been able to create these empty virus-like particles (VLPs), they have been significantly less stable than the complete virus and were therefore not suitable for making vaccines. Our research has developed methods of building the genome-free particles for all three types of the virus with the stability we need.  Professor George Lomonossoff said:  Growing large quantities of VLPs in plants is surprisingly easy and incredibly efficient. You simply introduce bacteria containing the genes for the VLP into the plant, which results in the plant s cells making many copies of the VLP. The process, from introduction of the bacteria to harvesting the VLPs from the crushed leaves can take just a matter of weeks. The added beauty of this technique is that the risk of contamination with other human viruses using this production technique is significantly lower than some other vaccine production systems.  The research consortium includes the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), University of Oxford, University of Reading, and Pirbright Institute and uses high resolution structure facilities at Diamond Light Source. Work at NIBSC led to the identification of new ways to stabilise polio VLPs without altering the structures of their shells and these VLPs are at least as stable to heating as the current inactivated polio vaccine. They also provide equivalent or better immunity to polio infection. What s more, these VLPs can be stored without refrigeration for many months without significant loss of activity. The lead scientist at NIBSC, Dr Andrew Macadam, said:  The approach we developed was remarkably effective and worked for all three types of polio so may have applications in the design of vaccines against other virus diseases. The challenge now is to transfer these designs to production systems that can deliver large quantities of VLPs cheaply so that a vaccine for global use is feasible.  The teams at Leeds and Reading are developing methods of producing candidate vaccines in yeast and insect cells, which have proven success in the manufacture of VLP vaccines   for example against hepatitis B virus and papillomaviruses - while expression in plants is being developed at the John Innes Centre. Although the principle of using plants rather than yeast and insect-based systems is well established, no major plant-based vaccine has yet been widely introduced.","Published: June 15, 2016"

Mednick, has found that the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is responsible for control of bodily functions not consciously directed (such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestive processes) plays a role in promoting memory consolidation the process of converting information from short-term to long-term memory during sleep. See Also: Electric current to brain boosts memory The groundbreaking study appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mednick and her team demonstrated, for the first time, that increases in ANS activity during sleep is correlated with memory improvement. ""Sleep has been shown to facilitate the transformation of recent experiences into long-term, stable memories,"" explained Mednick. ""But, past studies produced contradictory evidence about which specific sleep features enhance memory performance."" According to Mednick, this suggests that there may be unidentified events during sleep that play an important role in this process. Because memory during waking hours is enhanced by ANS activity, Mednick tested whether the ANS could be the missing link that explains how sleep promotes memory consolidation. To test this idea, Mednick and the team of researchers added a memory component to a well-known creativity test called the Remote Associates Test (RAT). In between two RAT testing sessions, they gave people a nap and measured the quality of sleep and heart activity. In the first part of the study, 81 healthy individuals were presented with RAT problems consisting of three seemingly unrelated words (e.g., cookies, sixteen, heart) and were required to find another word (e.g., sweet) that links the three words together. Some participants were also asked to complete an unrelated analogy task. The answers to the analogy task served as primes for solving some of the problems in the second RAT test that occurred after the nap. After completing these tasks, 60 of the participants took a 90-minute nap, while the remaining subjects watched a video. Later in the day, all the participants returned to the lab and completed RAT problems for a second time. The problems were either identical to the previous test (repeated condition), completely new (novel condition) or had the same answers as the analogy task (primed condition). See Also: Working memory: underlying processes are more complex than we thought Individuals who had a nap were more likely to answer the creativity problems in the afternoon with words that were primed by the morning analogies task compared with people who didn't nap. In other words, a nap helped the experimental subjects think more flexibly and combine primed words in ""new and useful"" combinations. Importantly, while approximately 40 percent of the performance improvement due to the nap could be predicted by the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when the researchers considered heart rate activity during REM, they could account for up to 73 percent of the performance increases. ""The findings suggest that ANS activity during REM sleep may be an unexplored contributor to sleep-related improvements in memory performance."" said Mednick. These results have implications for understanding the mind/body connection and relationships between sleep, cardiovascular health and cognitive functioning.

New molecular imaging research is revealing how tau, rather than amyloid-deposition, may be more directly instigating neuronal dysfunction, say presenters at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. See Also: Brain imaging links Alzheimer s decline to tau protein Exhaustive brain research has pieced together how extracellular beta-amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins are strongly linked to the neurodegenerative pathology of Alzheimer's disease. However, much of the research conducted to date has been post-mortem, which does little to help researchers understand the early development of disease. A new imaging study in living Alzheimer's patients is combining three methods of positron emission tomography (PET) to measure the orchestration of amyloid, tau and metabolic activity in the brain. Findings of the study showed a significant correlation between increased tau and decreased metabolic activity in the brain, a clear sign of neurodegeneration. ""Tau-imaging seems to be closely linked to actual onset of neuronal injury, whereas amyloid-imaging may allow us to detect a predisposition to disease many years ahead of the onset of symptoms,"" said Alexander Drzezga, MD, from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases at the University Hospital of Cologne in Cologne, Germany. For this study, 10 subjects with Alzheimer's underwent PET following the injection of three radiotracers: fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG), which images regional metabolic activity; carbon-11 Pittsburgh compound B (C-11 PiB), which has an affinity for amyloid plaques; and F-18 AV-1451, an emerging imaging agent that binds to tau in the brain. Results showed that increased tau was directly associated with hypometabolism (reflecting neuronal dysfunction) in the brain. For amyloid-deposition, no strong association with hypometabolism was found. However, an indirect interactivity between tau and amyloid was observed particularly in the parietal cortex, in that the negative impact of regional tau-deposition on metabolism was stronger in regions with higher amyloid-burden. ""Integrating these molecular imaging tools offers the opportunity to investigate the possible independent and synergistic contribution of these protein pathologies in neurodegeneration in the living brain and, therefore, greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Drzezga. Learn More: Immunotherapy used to reduce memory problems with Alzheimer s disease Further investigation of these and other factors of neurodegeneration in living dementia patients could one day help clinicians improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's, including new drugs that could potentially target tau in order to slow or stop degenerative effects in the brain. Multimodal imaging approaches like this one could allow more precise staging of neuropathology, even before the irrevocable onset of memory loss experienced by Alzheimer's patients. Furthermore, improved prediction, prognosis and therapy control/follow up may become feasible. More than 46 million people are currently living with Alzheimer's across the world, and that number is expected to rise steeply to 131.5 million by 2050. The global economic cost of the disease is expected to approach $1 trillion in the same period, according to the newest data from Alzheimer's Disease International.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disease characterized by hyperphagia a chronic feeling of hunger that, coupled with a metabolism that utilizes drastically fewer calories than normal, often leads to excessive eating and obesity in patients with the disease. It affects approximately 1 in 25,000 births about 350 to 400,000 individuals worldwide, and is recognized as the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity. See Also: In anorexia nervosa, brain responds differently to hunger signals Although much attention has been focused on the metabolic and behavioral outcomes of PWS, scientists still knew relatively little about the consequences of PWS on development of appetite-related brain pathways in the hypothalamus. This portion of the brain develops during neonatal life under the influence of both environmental and genetic factors. It has been suggested that, due to its importance in the control of eating and energy balance, early impairments of hypothalamic development may result in lifelong metabolic dysregulation. ""Our goal was to characterize the development of brain circuits involved in appetite regulation, using a mouse model for Prader-Willi syndrome. We specifically focused on the hypothalamus because it is the brain region critical for regulation of homeostatic processes such as feeding,"" said lead author Sebastien Bouret, PhD, a member of The Saban Research Institute's Developmental Neuroscience Program and an associate professor of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. Bouret and colleagues found that mice lacking Magel2, one of the genes responsible for PWS, display abnormal development of the brain connections that normally trigger satiation, telling the body it has gotten enough to eat. They also report that these neurodevelopmental defects are unlikely to involve endocrine factors hormones that regulate things like metabolism, growth and development. Rather, the gene Magel2 itself appears to have a direct effect on axonal growth. Don't Miss: Mulling the marijuana munchies: How the brain flips the hunger switch Based on previous findings showing a pivotal role for the metabolic hormones leptin and ghrelin in hypothalamic development, the scientists measured their levels in Magel2 knockout mice, comparing them to control mice.

Nevertheless, the macaw has more neurons in its forebrain the portion of the brain associated with intelligent behavior than the macaque. That is one of the surprising results of the first study to systematically measure the number of neurons in the brains of more than two dozen species of birds ranging in size from the tiny zebra finch to the six-foot-tall emu, which found that they consistently have more neurons packed into their small brains than are stuffed into mammalian or even primate brains of the same mass. See Also: Dopamine key to vocal learning, songbird study findsThe study results are published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""For a long time having a 'bird brain' was considered to be a bad thing: Now it turns out that it should be a compliment,"" said Vanderbilt University neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel, senior author of the paper with Pavel Nemec at the Charles University in Prague. The study provides a straightforward answer to a puzzle that comparative neuroanatomists have been wrestling with for more than a decade: how can birds with their small brains perform complicated cognitive behaviors? The conundrum was created by a series of studies beginning in the previous decade that directly compared the cognitive abilities of parrots and crows with those of primates. The studies found that the birds could manufacture and use tools, use insight to solve problems, make inferences about cause-effect relationships, recognize themselves in a mirror and plan for future needs, among other cognitive skills previously considered the exclusive domain of primates. The collection of avian brains that were analyzed. For each species, the total number of neurons (in millions) in their brains is shown in yellow, the number of neurons (in millions) in their forebrains (pallium) is shown in blue and their brain mass (in grams) is shown in red. The scale bar in the lower right is 10 mm. Courtesy: Herculano-Houzel, Vanderbilt University  Scientists were left with a generally unsatisfactory fallback position: Avian brains must simply be wired in a completely different fashion from primate brains. Two years ago, even this hypothesis was knocked down by a detailed study of pigeon brains, which concluded that they are, in fact, organized along quite similar lines to those of primates. The new study provides a more plausible explanation: Birds can perform these complex behaviors because birds' forebrains contain a lot more neurons than any one had previously thought as many as in mid-sized primates. ""We found that birds, especially songbirds and parrots, have surprisingly large numbers of neurons in their pallium: the part of the brain that corresponds to the cerebral cortex, which supports higher cognition functions such as planning for the future or finding patterns. That explains why they exhibit levels of cognition at least as complex as primates,"" said Herculano-Houzel, who recently joined the Vanderbilt psychology department. Learn More: Show us how you play and it may tell us who you are That is possible because the neurons in avian brains are much smaller and more densely packed than those in mammalian brains, the study found. Parrot and songbird brains, for example, contain about twice as many neurons as primate brains of the same mass and two to four times as many neurons as equivalent rodent brains. Not only are neurons packed into the brains of parrots and crows at a much higher density than in primate brains, but the proportion of neurons in the forebrain is also significantly higher, the study found. ""In designing brains, nature has two parameters it can play with: the size and number of neurons and the distribution of neurons across different brain centers,"" said Herculano-Houzel, ""and in birds we find that nature has used both of them."" Although she acknowledges that the relationship between intelligence and neuron count has not yet been firmly established, Herculano-Houzel and her colleagues argue that avian brains with the same or greater forebrain neuron counts than primates with much larger brains can potentially provide the birds with much higher ""cognitive power"" per pound than mammals. One of the important implications of the study, the neuroscientist said, is that it demonstrates that there is more than one way to build larger brains. Previously, neuroanatomists thought that as brains grew larger neurons had to grow bigger as well because they had to connect over longer distances. ""But bird brains show that there are other ways to add neurons: keep most neurons small and locally connected and only allow a small percentage to grow large enough to make the longer connections. This keeps the average size of the neurons down,"" she explained. Don't Miss: Brain size matters when it comes to animal self-control ""Something I love about science is that when you answer one question, it raises a number of new questions,"" said Herculano-Houzel. Among the questions that this study raises are whether the surprisingly large number of neurons in bird brains comes at a correspondingly large energetic cost, and whether the small neurons in bird brains are a response to selection for small body size due to flight, or possibly the ancestral way of adding neurons to the brain from which mammals, not birds, may have diverged. Herculano-Houzel hopes that the results of the study and the questions it raises will stimulate other neuroscientists to begin exploring the mysteries of the avian brain, especially how their behavior compares to that of mammals of similar numbers of neurons or brain size.

Their project aims to optimize breeding strategies for improving the yield and stress tolerance of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), a critical source of nutrition to millions of people living in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Illumina Agricultural Greater Good Initiative grant program is designed to help identify measures that can increase crop yields and improve livestock welfare and productivity to alleviate poverty and hunger in the developing world. Todd Mockler, PhD, Geraldine and Robert Virgil Distinguished Investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and co-PI Jeremy Schmutz, at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, will study the genetic diversity of grain sorghum leveraging the HiSeq X  Ten System at HudsonAlpha. NRGene's proprietary PanMAGICTM computational platforms will be used to construct the first ever sorghum pan-genome. Sorghum is a member of the grass family and is grown worldwide. It is of particular interest, not only because it is a staple crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, but because grain sorghum yields have been declining due to the lack of new varieties that are resistant to pests and pathogens. Sorghum is very resilient to drought and heat stress. Natural genetic diversity in sorghum makes it a promising system for identifying stress-resistance mechanisms in grasses that may have been lost during the domestication of related cereal crops.

The key to this variation lies in the inherent biological differences between individuals, which cannot all be explained genetically. At the same time, this variation makes it very difficult to develop ""standard"" treatments for certain diseases. In a groundbreaking initiative, EPFL and ETHZ scientists have developed a strategy that can define and explain metabolic differences between individuals, essentially paving the way for precision medicine. The work, which also highlights significant issues with animal-based drug studies, is published in Science. We are increasingly learning that medical interventions can be more successful when they are tailored to the specific profile of the individual patient. The problem is that defining that profile is extremely difficult, as it involves information on the person's genome, proteins, fats, and all sorts of other layers of biology that make up their tissues and body. And so far, the only differences that we have been seriously taking into account are those found between genes. This is what the labs of Johan Auwerx at EPFL and Ruedi Aebersold at ETH Zurich set out to solve with their recently published study. Looking at 40 different mice strains, the researchers successfully connected the variation between individuals' genomes to the variation between their proteomes -- their full set of proteins. In this way, they took a giant leap in profiling the biology of a particular individual. ""There is a black box between a patient's genome and their disease,"" says Johan Auwerx, whose lab handled the genome side of the study. ""What we have done here is find a way to fill the black box by obtaining information on the patient's proteome."" ""It's much more complex to measure the set of proteins than to sequence the entire genome,"" says Yibo Wu, co-lead author of the study. The scientists used protein data from mice, which they obtained from a new mass spectrometry technique that Aebersold's group developed, known as SWATH-MS. This is a technique that combines the advantages of high-throughput mass spectrometry with high reproducibility and consistency. In short, it is able to identify thousands of different proteins in hundreds of samples much faster and accurately than conventional techniques, allowing the researchers to measure the concentrations of a broad spectrum of liver proteins in the mice. The researchers measured a total of 2,600 different proteins from tissue samples of 40 mice strains, all of which came from the same two ancestors, meaning that they were genetically related to each other. ""We wanted to keep the genetics simple in order to observe differences in the impact of environment (diet) on the proteome, other layers of biology, and their predisposition to develop diseases,"" says Auwerx. The mice were divided into groups of representing each of the 40 strains, and the groups were fed either a high-fat diet - essentially junk food - or a healthy, low-fat diet. Over a few weeks, the scientists charted the mice's physiological data, and tested how fast they could gain weight on the junk-food diet and lose weight by exercising. Despite their similar genetic make-up, the mice on the high-fat diet showed varied responses to diet and exercise. For example, some developed metabolic disorders like fatty liver, while others did not. The researchers then combined the physiological data with data for their genome, their proteome, and their transcriptome, which is essentially their full set of RNAs - another biological ""layer"" in the black box. Through this combination, the scientists were able to better understand the role several proteins play when it comes to metabolizing fat and producing energy from it. ""Like the mouse strains in this study, each patient with a disease is genetically different"", says Ruedi Aebersold. ""The approach we used in the mouse cohort can now be applied one-for-one in research on human diseases, and particularly for personalized medicine."" The SWATH-MS approach is now ready to use in human cohort studies, as the researchers in his group have produces a corresponding database for thousands of human proteins. ""The aim here is to be able to customise medical intervention for each patient based on their individual biological makeup, the 'black box',"" says Auwerx. In this vein, his group is now looking at specific drugs that can be used more effectively with this approach to treat metabolic disorders.","Published: June 14, 2016"

Researchers from Princeton University and the University of Toronto found that when they repaired the mutated cilia genes, they restored cerebrospinal fluid flow and could prevent spinal curves from developing. If translatable to humans, the study could lead to a non-surgical approach for treating the condition known as idiopathic scoliosis, which has no known cause and affects roughly three out of every 100 adolescents. The research was published June 10 by the journal Science. ""This is the first hint of a biological mechanism for idiopathic scoliosis,"" said Rebecca Burdine, associate professor of molecular biology at Princeton, and a senior author of the study. ""We hope this research will open up new areas of inquiry as to how the disruptions to normal cerebrospinal fluid flow can lead to spinal curvature."" Burdine's lab conducted the study in collaboration with a team led by senior author Brian Ciruna, an associate professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto and a senior scientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. ""Traditionally, theories regarding the biology behind idiopathic scoliosis have revolved around defects in the bone, cartilage or neuromuscular activity,"" Ciruna said. ""The finding that defects in cerebrospinal fluid flow may be contributing to scoliosis came as a surprise. It is not a theory that had been put out there previously."" The study is the first to link spinal curvature to mutations in genes that govern motile cilia, which stick out from cells and make synchronous whip-like motions to push fluid through narrow passages such as the spinal column. Hazel Sive, a professor in biology at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the study, is an expert in the use of zebrafish to study vertebrate development. ""This study is an important step forward in understanding events underlying spinal curvature,"" Sive said. ""In an elegant set of experiments, the authors take advantage of the outstanding zebrafish system to define that cilia function and perhaps cerebrospinal fluid flow is required for normal spinal cord development."" Researchers in the Burdine laboratory had observed that mutant genes that disrupt cilia motility produce spinal curves in zebrafish as adults, although the work had not been published. ""I've presented this finding for years, but didn't have a way to link this work to human disease,"" Burdine said. ""Collaborating with Brian's group helped us make this link."" Previous research by Ciruna's lab revealed that mutations in a gene found in zebrafish and humans called protein tyrosine kinase-7 (ptk7) causes spinal curvature during a period of rapid growth that corresponds to adolescence in zebrafish. Published in the journal Nature Communications in 2014, the findings, suggested that the mutant fish could serve as a model for studying the condition. The researchers knew that the ptk7 gene plays a role in helping cells orient in the correct direction during embryonic development, but they didn't know that it also governed the formation of motile cilia. To explore how ptk7 mutations lead to spine curvature in zebrafish, Curtis Boswell, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, examined the brains and spinal cords of fish with mutated ptk7. In brain regions known as ventricles, which sit at the top of the spinal cord, the motile cilia were sparse and malformed and the fish developed a brain-swelling condition called hydrocephalus, which is associated with loss of cilia function. Using fluorescent dyes to track the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricles, the researchers saw that the flow was irregular and slower than normal. When the researchers introduced a non-mutated version of the ptk7 gene specifically into tissues harboring motile cilia, the hydrocephalus disappeared, the cerebrospinal fluid began to flow normally and the spine straightened. ""We demonstrated that if we could restore gene function in the motile ciliated tissues, we could restore cerebrospinal fluid flow, and we could actually prevent scoliosis in these mutants,"" Ciruna said. The researchers also tested other motile-cilia gene mutations to see whether they disrupt cerebrospinal fluid flow and cause spine curvature. Daniel Grimes, a postdoctoral research associate, and Nicholas Morante, a graduate student, both in the Burdine lab in Princeton's Department of Molecular Biology, studied four such mutations in genes called ccdc40, ccdc151, dyx1c1 and c21orf59. They found that all four gene mutations led to curvature of the spine in zebrafish. The researchers found that the damage to motile cilia function occurs and leads to the onset of scoliosis during adolescence for zebrafish, a period of rapid growth. They took advantage of the temperature-sensitivity of the mutant c21orf59 gene, which can be switched on or off by controlling temperature. They kept zebrafish embryos at 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), which switches the mutation off, so that the fish didn't develop embryonic defects. The researchers then moved groups of fish aged 19-, 24-, 29- or 34-days-old to a tank set at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degreees Fahrenheit), which turned the mutation on and stopped cilia-driven spinal fluid flow. The fish that were switched to the warmer tank at 19 days, which corresponds to adolescence, formed spinal curves. However, fish that were shifted to the warmer tank at ages 24 and 29 days respectively developed milder curves, and fish shifted at age 34 days did not develop curves. ""Together with the Burdine group we defined a critical window for motile cilia function and cerebrospinal fluid flow in normal spine development,"" Ciruna said. ""This window appears to be not during embryogenesis and not in adulthood, but specifically when fish are growing rapidly, in other words, fish adolescence."" Additionally, the development of spinal curves in these adolescent fish could be blocked by switching the fish back to the cooler tank. ""This provides proof-of-principle that the development of severe idiopathic scoliosis spinal curvatures can be managed without invasive surgical manipulation,"" the authors wrote in Science. Several additional lines of evidence point to links between motile cilia dysfunction, cerebrospinal fluid flow disruption and idiopathic scoliosis, Burdine said. For example, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder that causes defects in the movement of cilia lining the respiratory tract, have an elevated risk for scoliosis. Also, scoliosis is prevalent in humans with conditions such as tumors that obstruct cerebrospinal fluid flow. The next step will be to understand the mechanisms by which disrupted cerebrospinal fluid flow causes the spine to curve, Burdine said. ""Now that we can study idiopathic scoliosis in zebrafish,"" she said, ""we can begin to identify molecular pathways that are involved in spine curvature, and hopefully, find therapeutic targets to address this condition.""","Published: June 14, 2016"

As stated at the time of Avacta s interim results, establishing commercial relationships in the POC testing market is one of the Company s key strategic objectives. The non-exclusive collaboration with Mologic will focus on the development of novel Affimer-based diagnostic assays and the subsequent development of new lateral flow devices (LFDs) as POC diagnostics for human healthcare. Both companies will share in the future revenues from the commercialisation of the marketed diagnostics.  POC testing is performed at the time and place of patient care (e.g. doctor s surgery), and provides results more rapidly than if samples are sent to a laboratory. POC testing is dominated by lateral flow technology where the test result is displayed through the appearance of coloured bars on a test strip. The lateral flow diagnostics market is worth $5bn annually and is growing at around 7% per annum.  The development of Affimer-based LFDs will address many of the existing limitations of traditional antibody-based systems. Current lateral flow technology relies predominantly on antibody-based detection which can limit specificity and the detection of certain classes of target molecule. In addition, lengthy development times, combined with poor consistency and reproducibility often create manufacturing challenges. In comparison, the generation of Affimer molecules typically takes weeks rather than months, and as the process is based on tuneable, recombinant technology, Affimer reagents can be specifically engineered to a wide range of targets, in a highly consistent, reproducible and cost-effective process.  Mologic, whose senior management team has a long track record of successfully bringing rapid tests to market, is a UK-based developer of POC solutions and has been developing lateral flow technology for well over a decade.  Dr Alastair Smith, Chief Executive Officer, Avacta, commented:  I am very pleased that we have established this collaborative partnership with Mologic, who are well recognised as an innovative developer of lateral flow devices. It is important that Avacta forges co-development relationships such as this in the strategic application areas we have identified. They offer the opportunity to leverage each party s expertise to rapidly progress and develop the Affimer technology in these key markets, for delivery of new and innovative tools for clinical and bio-therapeutic applications. This partnership is a great endorsement of the value of Affimer technology in rapid test diagnostics, and I look forward to working together with Mologic and reporting on progress.  Mark Davis, Chief Executive Officer, Mologic, said:  At Mologic we are continually working to find new ways to improve LFDs. By partnering with Avacta and becoming one of the first companies to develop LFD tests using the Affimer platform, we have the potential to address a wider range of challenging targets than is possible with antibodies alone, with faster development times and improved performance, to the benefit of customers and patients.

See Also: Learning from scorpions to control impulses A study co-led by Rongsheng Jin, professor of physiology & biophysics at the University of California, Irvine; Min Dong with Boston Children's Hospital-Harvard Medical School; and Andreas Rummel with the Hannover Medical School in Germany, reveals an important general mechanism by which the pathogen is attracted to, adapts to and takes advantage of glycan modifications in surface receptors to invade motor neurons. Glycans are chains of sugars synthesized by cells for their development, growth, functioning or survival. The results appear in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology. ""Our findings reveal a new paradigm of the everlasting host-pathogen arms race, where a pathogen develops a smart strategy to achieve highly specific binding to a host receptor while also tolerating genetic changes on the receptor,"" Jin said. ""And to some extent, this mechanism by which the toxin attacks human is similar to the one that is utilized by some important broad-neutralizing human antibodies to fight viruses, such as dengue viruses and HIV."" Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), commonly known as the Botox toxin, is widely used in a weakened form for treating various medical conditions as well as for cosmetics. The clinical product Botox contains extremely low doses of the toxin and is safe to use. But at higher doses, it can be lethal, and it's also classified as a potential bioterrorism agent. Its potency and therapeutic effects rely on its extraordinary ability to target motor neurons and subsequently block release neurotransmitters that control the movement of muscle fiber, which can result in paralysis. This specific targeting is achieved by highly selective interactions between the toxin and its receptors - host proteins that bind to the toxin in a lock and key manner. Learn More: Secret of tetanus toxicity offers new way to treat motor neuron disease The intricate detail of how the Botox toxin recognizes its receptors also reveals novel ways to neutralizing these deadly toxins. ""With this new structural information,"" Rummel said, ""we were able to pinpoint key amino acids in the toxin that are required for binding to sugars, and we found that even mutating a single amino acid is sufficient to abolish the toxicity by more than a million fold."" Remarkably, the newly mapped glycan-binding site turns out to be also the site recognized by a potent human neutralizing antibody called CR2/CR1, which is currently in clinical trial for the treatment and prevention of BoNT/A poisoning.

Known as CD36, this membrane receptor is usually intensely expressed in fatty tissue, where it regulates lipid metabolism. It also plays a well-known role in the immune system, where it is required for phagocytosis of potentially harmful molecules by macrophages. Previous research has linked the presence of CD36 in the tongues of mammals with a preference for high-fat food. See Also: Key regulatory role for mysterious olfaction molecule OMP""The existence of CD36 in nasal sensory neurons is a novel discovery and appears to point to olfactory detection of lipids in mammals. Like the tongue, this may be linked to a preference for fatty food,"" said Isaias Glezer, a professor in the Biochemistry Department at the Federal University of S o Paulo. Another possibility is that this receptor is linked to perception of smells by individuals of the same species and to social interactions, since there is evidence of the existence of lipidic pheromones. The discovery was made in a study of the nasal mucous membrane in mice, in collaboration with the University of S o Paulo's Chemistry Institute and the University of Campinas's Biology Institute, as well as with support from the Center for Research on Redox Processes in Biomedicine (Redoxoma), one of the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Centers (RIDCs) funded by the S o Paulo Research Foundation. The researchers now plan to confirm whether the lipid molecule receptor is also present in human olfactory epithelium. According to Glezer, the initial aim of the investigation was to understand the role played in neurons by CD36 and other molecules associated with innate immune response. Learn More: Decoding characteristic food odors To investigate the function of these olfactory neurons that express CD36, they performed experiments with two groups of mice, one wild-type group (not genetically modified) and another group comprising mice of the same lineage that did not express CD36. The researchers measured the times taken by each of the groups to explore a piece of paper soaked in saline solution and another piece of paper scented with a mixture of fatty acids. The wild-type animals (with CD36) spent far more time exploring the lipid-scented paper than the saline-soaked paper, while in the group without CD36 the difference was not significant. ""On its own, of course, this doesn't prove that CD36 receptors in these sensory neurons are responsible for olfactory detection of lipids and the preference for this almost imperceptible smell, but it's strong evidence in that direction,"" Glezer said. ""In addition, we showed that CD36 concentrates in the ciliary layer of the olfactory epithelium, the portion responsible for odorant detection. However, more evidence was required for the purposes of scientific journal peer review."" Glezer and his collaborators therefore decided to investigate whether CD36 expression in the olfactory epithelium was linked to the expression of any other olfactory receptors. There are approximately a thousand different genes that encode olfactory receptors in mice, according to Glezer, and each olfactory neuron expresses only one of these genes. With the assistance of a UK research group who were studying the gene expression profiles of olfactory neurons one by one using single-cell RNA sequencing, led by Darren Logan at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Brazilian researchers were able to demonstrate a correlation between CD36 expression and expression of a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor called Olfr287. Don't Miss: Can autism be measured in a sniff?""So, we can state that there is indeed a subpopulation of neurons which express CD36 and Olfr287 concomitantly. This is no accident.

Among the research group's future plans is a project to explore in greater detail the functioning of the Olfr287 receptor in order to discover how it is activated and what happens to it in the absence of CD36, for example.

""Interventions that mitigate cognitive deterioration without causing side effects may provide an additive, safe option for individuals who are worried about brain and memory changes."" For the study, 50 adults ages 54-94 with amnestic MCI were randomly assigned to either a strategy-based, gist reasoning training group or a new-learning control group. Each group received two hour-long training sessions each week. The gist reasoning group received and practiced strategies on how to absorb and understand complex information, and the new-learning group used an educational approach to teach and discuss facts about how the brain works and what factors influence brain health. Strategies in the gist reasoning training group focused on higher-level brain functions such as strategic attention the ability to block out distractions and irrelevant details and focus on what is important; integrated reasoning the ability to synthesize new information by extracting a memorable essence, pearl of wisdom, or take-home message; and innovation the ability to appreciate diverse perspectives, derive multiple interpretations and generate new ideas to solve problems. Pre- and post-training assessments measured changes in cognitive functions between the two groups. The gist reasoning group improved in executive function (i.e., strategic attention to recall more important items over less-important ones) and memory span (i.e., how many details a person can hold in their memory after one exposure, such as a phone number). The new learning group improved in detail memory (i.e., a person's ability to remember details from contextual information).

""The aim of our study was to evaluate post-stroke BSCB condition that might lead to the development of more effective therapies for stroke survivors."" The BSCB provides a specialized protective 'microenvironment' for neural cells in the spinal cord. Substantial vascular damage is a major pathologic feature of both subacute and chronic stroke caused by an extended period of microvascular permeability after the BSCB loses integrity. Damage to the BSCB, explained the researchers, plays a fundamental role in the development of several pathological conditions, including abnormal motor function. The researchers, who evaluated the BSCB in test animals at seven and 30 days after stroke modeling, found that ischemic stroke damaged the gray and white matter in the cervical spinal cord on both sides of the spinal column, based on analysis of electron microscope images. Among the effects were damage to neural cells called 'astrocytes,' loss of motor neurons, reduced integrity of a tight junction protein between barrier cells, and swollen axons with damaged myelin in ascending and descending tracts connecting to the brain. They also found stroke-associated 'upregulation' of Beclin-1 in endothelial cells composing the BSCB. Beclin-1, explained the researchers, helps induce autophagy, an activity associated with removal of various intracellular components. They also observed a decrease in LC3B, an essential autophagy protein, at a later stage post-stroke. These observations of Beclin-1 and LC3B suggest an impaired post-stroke autophagy process in spinal cord capillaries, inducing endothelial cell degeneration. These stroke-related alterations in the cervical spinal cord indicate pervasive and long-lasting BSCB damage that would severely affect spinal cord function, wrote the researchers, adding that the widespread microvascular impairment in the gray and white matter of the cervical spinal cord aggravated motor neuron deterioration and had the potential to cause motor dysfunction.

About 60 percent of all MCI patients have MCI caused by an early stage of Alzheimer s disease. The remaining 40 percent of cases are caused by other factors, including vascular issues, drug side-effects and depression. To provide proper care, physicians need to know which cases of MCI are due to early Alzheimer s and which are not,  said Cassandra DeMarshall, the study s lead author, and a PhD candidate at the Rowan University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.  Our results show that it is possible to use a small number of blood-borne autoantibodies to accurately diagnose early-stage Alzheimer s. These findings could eventually lead to the development of a simple, inexpensive and relatively noninvasive way to diagnose this devastating disease in its earliest stages.   It is now generally believed that Alzheimer s-related changes begin in the brain at least a decade before the emergence of telltale symptoms,  Nagele explained.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first blood test using autoantibody biomarkers that can accurately detect Alzheimer s at an early point in the course of the disease when treatments are more likely to be beneficial   that is, before too much brain devastation has occurred.  Nagele is the study s corresponding author and the director of the Biomarker Discovery Center at Rowan s New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging. He is also the co-founder and chief scientific officer of Durin Technologies, Inc. The researchers presented their results in an article published in Alzheimer s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring that also reported the test s ability to accurately  stage the disease,  meaning it can distinguish early-stage Alzheimer s at MCI from later, more advanced stages. The test was also disease-specific. It readily distinguished early Alzheimer s at the MCI stage from other diseases including Parkinson s disease, multiple sclerosis, and early stage breast cancer. For the study, the Rowan University researchers analyzed blood samples from 236 subjects, including 50 MCI subjects with low levels of amyloid-beta 42 peptide in their cerebrospinal fluid. The latter is a reliable indicator of ongoing Alzheimer s pathology in the brain and predicts a likely rapid progression to Alzheimer s. Employing human protein microarrays, each containing 9,486 unique human proteins that are used as bait to attract blood-borne autoantibodies, the researchers identified the top 50 autoantibody biomarkers capable of detecting ongoing early-stage Alzheimer s pathology in patients with MCI. In multiple tests, the 50 biomarkers were 100 percent accurate in distinguishing patients with MCI due to Alzheimer s from healthy age- and gender-matched controls. Further testing of the selected MCI biomarker panel demonstrated similar high overall accuracy rates in differentiating patients with early Alzheimer s at the MCI stage from those with more advance, mild-moderate Alzheimer s (98.7 percent), early-stage Parkinson s disease (98.0 percent), multiple sclerosis (100 percent) and breast cancer (100 percent). In their report, the researchers acknowledge that the utility of their MCI biomarker panel as a blood test for early detection of Alzheimer s disease will hinge on a successful larger replication study using an independent patient cohort. However, they also point out that, because this blood-based diagnostic strategy is dependent on the presence of Alzheimer s pathology which can be underway many years before symptoms emerge, this approach could open the door to even earlier pre-symptomatic detection of Alzheimer s disease. According to the authors, early diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease and the ability to stage the disease through a simple blood test would offer many potential benefits. Patients could possibly delay disease progression through lifestyle adjustments, begin treatment sooner and plan future medical care. Clinicians would have a way to measure the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention and clinical trials could enroll patients who were truly at the earliest stage of their disease.","Published: June 13, 2016"

But what if researchers could predict the impacts of potentially harmful chemicals, viruses or drugs on human beings without resorting to animal or even human test subjects? To help achieve that, a team of scientists and engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is developing a  human-on-a-chip,  a miniature external replication of the human body, integrating biology and engineering with a combination of microfluidics and multi-electrode arrays. The project, known as iCHIP (in-vitro Chip-based Human Investigational Platform), reproduces four major biological systems vital to life: the central nervous system (brain), peripheral nervous system, the blood-brain barrier and the heart. Skipping over animal testing  It s a testing platform for exposure to agents whose effects are unknown to humans,  said LLNL engineer Dave Soscia, who co-leads development of the  brain-on-a-chip  device used to simulate the central nervous system.  If you have a system that is engineered to more closely replicate the human environment, you can skip over the really lengthy process of animal testing, which doesn t necessarily give us information relevant to humans.  The iCHIP team is focusing its efforts on the brain, where they re looking to understand how neurons interact with each other and react to chemical stimuli such as caffeine, atropine (a drug used to treat poisonings and cardiac arrest) and capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their hotness, as well as real chemical agents in the Lab s Forensic Science Center. Unique to the iCHIP platform is combining multiple brain types on the same device without barriers between those regions. To study the brain, primary neurons are funneled or  seeded  onto a microelectrode array device, which can accommodate up to four brain regions (such as the hippocampus, thalamus, basal ganglia and cortices). After the cells grow, a chemical (atropine for example) is introduced and the electrical activity from the neurons is recorded.  The idea is that we can look at network-wide effects across different brain regions,  Soscia said.  It adds a level of complexity that has never been done before.  Preliminary results have shown that hippocampal and cortical cells can survive on the chip for several months while their responses are recorded and analyzed, Soscia said. Modeling the brain's gatekeeper Filtering out chemicals and toxins before they reach the central nervous system in the body is accomplished by the blood-brain barrier, which is being reproduced by a team led by LLNL engineer Monica Moya. The device uses tubes and microfluidic chips to simulate blood flow through the brain. Moya and her team are testing the device with caffeine and other agents to ensure the system is performing and the cells are reacting as they would in a human body. The blood brain barrier is the brain s gatekeeper, allowing nutrients to enter in the brain from the blood flow while keeping out potential toxins. It works so well that it unfortunately can also block potentially useful therapeutics to the central nervous system,  Moya said.  Having a realistic human lab model of the blood-brain barrier will help researchers study the barrier s permeability and be incredibly useful as an in vitro model for drug development.  The iCHIP research, Moya said, could have implications for creating new drugs to fight cancer, vaccines or evaluating the efficacy of countermeasures against biowarfare agents. Lab scientist Heather Enright is leading research into the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which connects the brain to the limbs and organs. The PNS device has arrays of microelectrodes embedded on glass, where primary human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are seeded. Chemical stimuli such as capsaicin (to study pain response) then flow through a microfluidic cap to stimulate the cells on the platform. The microelectrodes record electrical signals from the cells, allowing researchers to determine how the cells are responding to the stimuli non-invasively. Microscopic images can be acquired at the same time to monitor changes in intracellular ion concentrations, such as calcium. This platform is the first to demonstrate that long-term culture and chemical interrogation of primary human DRG neurons on microelectrode arrays is possible, presenting researchers with an advantage over current techniques. Early research being done to replicate heart on a chip  Traditionally, electrophysiology studies are done with patch clamping, where the cell is perforated and damaged,  Enright said.  A multi-electrode array approach, like that used on iCHIP, really allows you to interrogate the cells over multiple trials so we can maximize the data we get from them. This is especially important when testing rare primary human cells. When you re looking at exposure to an unknown chemical for instance, the cells  response may be different weeks or months compared to hours after exposure. This is a non-invasive way of assessing changes in their health and function over time.  Additionally, early research is being done to replicate the heart on a chip. Cardiac cells have already been shown to successfully  beat  in response to electrical stimulation, with the intent to simultaneously measure the electrophysiology and movement of the cells. The next step, according to iCHIP principal investigator Elizabeth Wheeler, is integrating all the systems together to create a complete testing platform outside the human body to study some fundamental scientific questions.  The ultimate goal is to fully represent the human body,  Wheeler said.  Not only can the iCHIP provide human-relevant data for vaccine and countermeasure development, it also can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms. The knowledge gained from these human-on-a-chip systems will someday be used for personalized medicine. ","Published: June 13, 2016"

With more than 18 million people experiencing OSA, a number expected to rise, new results from a University of Pennsylvania (Penn) case study of a new device implanted in the chest called hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) offers promise for patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP. Researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania will present data on their outcomes with hypoglossal nerve stimulation for the treatment of patients with sleep apnea at SLEEP 2016, the 30th annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies LLC. See Also: Brain damage caused by severe sleep apnea is reversible The device is a pacemaker with a tiny generator and a sensing lead, but instead of using electrical pulses to control abnormal heart rate, the device uses two wires to stimulate the tongue. Patients use a remote control to turn on the device before going to sleep and turn it off upon waking up. A delay allows the user to fall asleep before the pulse generator begins stimulation. After detecting the user's breathing pattern, the machine stimulates the hypoglossal nerve (the nerve that controls tongue motion) which enlarges the upper airway. In the current Penn case study, 20 implants were completed at the University of Pennsylvania between January 2015 and March 2016. All patients had information from a baseline polysomnography (PSG) recording prior to HGNS implant, as well as a post PSG approximately two months after HGNS, to assess the severity of their apnea and any change after treatment. Those who received the implant were typically overweight, middle aged, and had severe OSA. Total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) which measures severity of sleep apnea by counting the number of pauses in breathing during sleep for all patients significantly decreased an average of 35 events per hour after the device was planted, which corresponds to an average reduction of 84 percent. Additionally, the lowest oxygen level measured in the blood during the night significantly increased by 11 percent, from 79 percent to 90 percent. In the previous STAR clinical trial, NCT01161420, which led to the device's FDA approval in April 2014 for patients unable to tolerate CPAP, patients implanted with the Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation device showed a 78 percent reduction in AHI and 80 percent fewer oxygen desaturation events (number of times the oxygen levels in the blood were low). These results were sustained three years after the device was implanted. The STAR trial was conducted under controlled conditions, while the Penn study takes the next step by looking at outcomes in post-approval clinical use of the device. By replicating the success of the clinical trial, the findings show that the device is as successful in the general clinical population as it was in participants that met the previous clinical trial criteria.

The findings published in The Lancet Neurology journal suggest that the pattern of damage to the brain seen among men exposed to blast shockwaves was different to the pattern of damage seen in men exposed to other types of head injury. However, the authors warn that the lack of information about the soldiers' medical histories means that more research is needed to better understand associations between brain damage and the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms reported by soldiers exposed to blast shockwaves from high explosives, such as grenades and mortars, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). See Also: Impact of traumatic brain injury on long-term memory explored ""Blast-related brain injuries are the signature injury of modern military conflicts"", explains senior author Dr. Daniel Perl from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Maryland, USA. ""Although routine imaging for blast-related traumatic brain injury often shows no brain abnormalities, soldiers frequently report debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms such as headaches, sleep disturbance, memory problems, erratic behaviour and depression suggesting structural damage to the brain. Because the underlying pathophysiology is unknown, we have difficulty diagnosing and treating these 'invisible wounds'."" With more than 300,000 US service personnel deployed to conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq sustaining at least one traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by exposure to explosive blasts (ranging from mild concussion to memory and cognition problems), the long-term consequences of hidden brain injuries from explosive devices are a growing concern. Yet, very little is known about the underlying neuropathology of TBI. Dr. Perl and colleagues examined the brain tissues of eight deceased former military personnel who survived explosive attacks in combat but later died of other causes. In five male soldiers who survived more than 6 months after blast exposure, they found a distinctive, consistent, and unique pattern of prominent scarring in parts of the brain that are crucial for cognitive function, memory, sleep and other important functions. In case one, for example, scarring was seen in several structures associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The brains of three male soldiers who died shortly after an explosive blast (4-60 days) showed a similar distinctive pattern of early scar formation in the same locations, further suggesting that this unique pattern may relate to the blast itself. The researchers compared the soldier's brains to those of 15 male civilians including individuals with histories of exposure to impact traumatic brain injury through contact sports and motor vehicle accidents. The authors also studied cases with chronic opioid abuse and a case with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE; a neurodegenerative disorder related to repeated head trauma associated with participation in contact sports). Related: CTE is confirmed as a unique disease that can be definitively diagnosed The study is a case series, meaning that the findings are descriptive and show differences between the brains of men exposed to blast injuries and those that weren't. With this methodology, it is not possible to discern whether the scars found in the brains of these soldiers were the direct consequence of the blast. As Dr. Perl explains, ""In these controls we did not see similar scarring to the blast cases, which increases the likelihood that the pattern is linked with high-explosive exposure. Although little is known about the effect of blast shockwave on the human brain, the unique pattern of damage that we found is consistent with known shockwave effects on the human body."" ""This is one small study, with limitations"", adds Dr. Perl. ""It is virtually impossible to obtain comprehensive head injury histories to rule out previous traumatic brain injury, or to get accurate data on injury severity such as the number of blast exposures, proximity to detonation, and power of explosion. As exposure to blast shockwaves increases among soldiers and civilians in war zones, we need to further study these patterns, and compare them with soldiers' medical history in order to build a better understanding of the neuropathology of traumatic brain injury."" Don't Miss: Neuroimaging technique identifies concussion-related brain disease in living brain Writing in a linked Comment, Dr. William Stewart at the University of Glasgow, UK and Dr. Douglas Smith at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA say that whether these findings stand up to scrutiny from more comprehensive studies remains to be seen. They write, ""Unquestionably, [this study] is commendable in drawing attention to the need for careful study of human tissue to further understanding of traumatic brain injury. However, far from an answer to the question of what is blast traumatic brain injury, the work instead exposes the remarkable absence of robust human neuropathology studies in this field. Progress in TBI research, both blast and non-blast, can only benefit from efforts directed specifically to facilitate acquisition of human tissue samples linked to detailed clinical information to support robust and informative neuropathology studies. Meanwhile, we must remain cautious in interpreting the significance of any single pathology as unique to blast-associated TBI based on a small and heterogeneous case series and little clinical information, and few control comparisons.""

It is a condition that affects only men and it appears between 40 and 50 years of age, and there is no specific treatment available. Knowledge of the minute details of the proteins that are linked to diseases is crucial if we are to discover therapeutic targets and thus pave the way for possible treatments. Such knowledge gains even more relevance when dealing with rare diseases that have received little attention and for which no treatments are available, such as the case of Kennedy's disease. See Also: Protein clusters targeted by medications for neurodegenerative diseases actually serve to protect brain cells Xavier Salvatella, ICREA (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies) researcher at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), in collaboration with scientists from the University of Florence, has described a molecular system of protection that involves the androgen receptor protein, a molecule that is mutated in patients with Kennedy's disease and which cause progressive muscle wastage. The finding brings in-depth molecular insights that can lead to new studies and bring researchers closer to finding a therapeutic target for Kennedy's disease. The study has been published in Biophysical Journal. In Kennedy's disease, the muscle cells and motor neurons are damaged as a result of the accumulation of androgen receptor fibers a process that causes them to die. ""Many aspects of diseases involving aggregates, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are unknown. In this regard, Kennedy's disease is in a worse position because it is a rare condition,"" explains Xavier Salvatella, head of the Molecular Biophysics Lab at IRB Barcelona. The onset of this genetically inherited disease occurs in late adulthood, affecting one in every 40,000 men and causing progressive deterioration of all muscles. Although not fatal, the condition is debilitating, and 20% of those affected eventually need a wheel chair. Learn More: Targeting upper motor neurons to treat ALS Salvatella studies the sequence of molecular events that causes the aggregation of androgen receptors. He and his team seek to determine the regions of the protein sequence responsible for aggregation in order to identify valid targets to direct therapies and to prevent this process. The mutation carried by those affected by Kennedy's disease causes a repeated and excessively long chain of a specific amino acid, namely glutamine, which impairs the activity of the androgen receptor. This protein, which activates the hormone testosterone, is responsible for triggering the genetic programme that favors the differential characteristics of men: more hair, deep voice, larger hands, etc. Androgen receptor structure. In orange, leucines induce the glutamine chain to form a helix, red. The leucines protect against aggregation. Credit: B. Topal, IRB Barcelona  During adolescence, and depending on the extent to which they are affected, boys with the mutation do not fully develop the male phenotype, but this is often not diagnosed. In a second stage, in adulthood, muscle degeneration begins. ""It is known that the longer the polyglutamine chain, the earlier the onset of muscle atrophy. What we don't know and what this study helps us to understand is why the harmful effect is triggered when the length of the poly glutamine exceed 38 residues"". Thanks to access to one of the main nuclear magnetic resonance facilities in Europe, located at the University of Florence, for the first time the scientists have studied the protein in a test tube. They have observed that right next to the glutamine chain there is a region comprised by four leucine residues that allay the effects of the mutation. The leucine molecules favour the folding of the polyglutamine chain into a helix, a structure that prevents the chains from adhering to one another. However, the impact of the leucine molecule on the glutamine region is limited, and if there are many glutamine amino acids, the chains do not fold. Instead, they stretch out like rods, stick to each other, and end up forming a fibrous wall. Don't Miss: Scientists see motor neurons 'walking' in real time ""We have seen that four leucine molecules delay this process. What would happen in the presence of six?"" asks Salvatella. ""Conceptually speaking, one clever way of delaying the aggregation could be to use drugs to strengthen the effect of the leucine residues that have so much influence on the mutation site that causes the protein to aggregate,"" reflects Salvatella. Salvatella's work indicates that in-depth knowledge of the different protein sequences and how they affect each other may reveal new therapeutic targets. The IRB Barcelona scientist is engaged in several research lines devoted to Kennedy's disease. His studies involve the development of techniques and studies with mice and with chaperones proteins that bind to any protein that is about to aggregate.

These cells have an unlimited capacity to regenerate themselves, making more cancer stem cells and more tumors. Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have now unraveled how pre-leukemic white blood cell precursors become leukemia stem cells. The study, published in Cell Stem Cell, used human cells to define the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 s role in leukemia, and find a way to stop it. While DNA is like the architect s blueprint for a cell, RNA is the like the engineer s interpretation of the blueprint. That RNA version is frequently flawed in cancer. While many studies have uncovered pivotal DNA mutations in cancer, few have addressed the roles of RNA and mechanisms that regulate RNA.  In this study, we showed that cancer stem cells co-opt a RNA editing system to clone themselves. What s more, we found a method to dial it down,  said senior author Catriona Jamieson, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Regenerative Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. The enzyme at the center of this study, ADAR1, can edit the sequence of microRNAs, small pieces of genetic material. By swapping out just one microRNA building block for another, ADAR1 alters the carefully orchestrated system cells use to control which genes are turned on or off at which times. ADAR1 is known to promote cancer progression and resistance to therapy. In this study, Jamieson s team used human blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia cells in the lab, and mice transplanted with these cells, to determine ADAR1 s role in governing leukemia stem cells. The researchers uncovered a series of molecular events. First, white blood cells with a leukemia-promoting gene mutation become more sensitive to signs of inflammation. That inflammatory response activates ADAR1. Then, hyper-ADAR1 editing slows down the microRNAs known as let-7. Ultimately, this activity increases cellular regeneration, or self-renewal, turning white blood cell precursors into leukemia stem cells. Leukemia stem cells promote an aggressive, therapy-resistant form of the disease called blast crisis.  This is the first mechanistic link between pro-cancer inflammatory signals and RNA editing-driven reprogramming of precursor cells into leukemia stem cells,  said Jamieson, who is also deputy director of the Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center at UC San Diego Health, director of the CIRM Alpha Stem Cell Clinic at UC San Diego School of Medicine and director of stem cell research at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center. After learning how the ADAR1 system works, Jamieson s team looked for a way to stop it. By inhibiting sensitivity to inflammation or inhibiting ADAR1 with a small molecule tool compound, the researchers were able to counter ADAR1 s effect on leukemia stem cell self-renewal and restore let-7. Self-renewal of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia cells was reduced by approximately 40 percent when treated with the small molecule, called 8-Aza, as compared to untreated cells.  Based on this research, we believe that detecting ADAR1 activity will be important for predicting cancer progression. In addition, inhibiting this enzyme represents a unique therapeutic vulnerability in cancer stem cells with active inflammatory signaling that may respond to pharmacologic inhibitors of inflammation sensitivity or selective ADAR1 inhibitors that are currently being developed,  Jamieson said.","Published: June 10, 2016"

It is expected that the MESO-BRAIN will facilitate a better understanding of human disease progression, neuronal growth and enable the development of large-scale human cell-based assays to test the modulatory effects of pharmacological and toxicological compounds on neural network activity. The use of more physiologically relevant human models will increase drug screening efficiency and reduce the need for animal testing.   About the MESO-BRAIN project The MESO-BRAIN project s cornerstone will use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that have been differentiated into neurons upon a defined and reproducible 3D scaffold to support the development of human neural networks that emulate brain activity. The structure will be based on a brain cortical module and will be unique in that it will be designed and produced using nanoscale 3D-laser-printed structures incorporating nano-electrodes to enable downstream electrophysiological analysis of neural network function. Optical analysis will be conducted using cutting-edge light sheet-based, fast volumetric imaging technology to enable cellular resolution throughout the 3D network. The MESO-BRAIN project will allow for a comprehensive and detailed investigation of neural network development in health and disease. Prof Edik Rafailov, Head of the MESO-BRAIN project (Aston University) said:  What we re proposing to achieve with this project has, until recently, been the stuff of science fiction. Being able to extract and replicate neural networks from the brain through 3D nanoprinting promises to change this. The MESO-BRAIN project has the potential to revolutionise the way we are able to understand the onset and development of disease and discover treatments for those with dementia or brain injuries. We cannot wait to get started!    The MESO-BRAIN project will launch in September 2016 and research will be conducted over three years.  ","Published: June 10, 2016"

A new method developed by UCLA scientists could eventually lead to a way to do just that, using data about patients  genetic sequences to produce more reliable projections for survival time and how they might respond to possible treatments. The technique is an innovative way of using biomedical big data   which gleans patterns and trends from massive amounts of patient information   to achieve precision medicine   giving doctors the ability to better tailor their care for each individual patient. The approach is likely to enable doctors to give more accurate predictions for people with many types of cancers. In this research, the UCLA scientists studied cancers of the breast, brain (glioblastoma multiforme, a highly malignant and aggressive form; and lower grade glioma, a less aggressive version), lung, ovary and kidney. In addition, it may allow scientists to analyze people s genetic sequences and determine which are lethal and which are harmless. The new method analyzes various gene isoforms   combinations of genetic sequences that can produce an enormous variety of RNAs and proteins from a single gene   using data from RNA molecules in cancer specimens. That process, called RNA sequencing, or RNA-seq, reveals the presence and quantity of RNA molecules in a biological sample. In the method developed at UCLA, scientists analyzed the ratios of slightly different genetic sequences within the isoforms, enabling them to detect important but subtle differences in the genetic sequences. In contrast, the conventional analysis aggregates all of the isoforms together, meaning that the technique misses important differences within the isoforms. SURVIV (for  survival analysis of mRNA isoform variation ) is the first statistical method for conducting survival analysis on isoforms using RNA-seq data, said senior author Yi Xing, a UCLA associate professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers report having identified some 200 isoforms that are associated with survival time for people with breast cancer; some predict longer survival times, others are linked to shorter times. Armed with that knowledge, scientists might eventually be able to target the isoforms associated with shorter survival times in order to suppress them and fight disease, Xing said. The researchers evaluated the performance of survival predictors using a metric called C-index and found that across the six different types of cancer they analyzed, their isoform-based predictions performed consistently better than the conventional gene-based predictions. The result was surprising because it suggests, contrary to conventional wisdom, that isoform ratios provide a more robust molecular signature of cancer patients than overall gene abundance, said Xing, director of UCLA s bioinformatics doctoral program and a member of the UCLA Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences.  Our finding suggests that isoform ratios provide a more robust molecular signature of cancer patients in large-scale RNA-seq datasets,  he said. The researchers studied tissues from 2,684 people with cancer whose samples were part of the National Institutes of Health s Cancer Genome Atlas, and they spent more than two years developing the algorithm for SURVIV. According to Xing, a human gene typically produces seven to 10 isoforms.  In cancer, sometimes a single gene produces two isoforms, one of which promotes metastasis and one of which represses metastasis,  he said, adding that understanding the differences between the two is extremely important in combatting cancer.  We have just scratched the surface,  Xing said.  We will apply the method to much larger data sets, and we expect to learn a lot more.  Co-authors of the research are lead author Shihao Shen, a senior research scientist in Xing s laboratory; Ying Nian Wu, a UCLA professor of statistics; Yuanyuan Wang, and Chengyang Wang, UCLA doctoral students.

This variation is found not only in the petunias available at garden centers, but also in wild petunias. All of these different petunia-types are often pollinated by different insects and birds. Some are attracted to purple flowers, others to white flowers. Some fit into the smallest flowers, others can reach the nectar at the end of the long perianth. A large international team of researchers, including scientists from Wageningen University, have now sequenced the entire genome of two different wild petunia species, and published this in the important scientific journal Nature Plants. The sequences have shown, that the regions of DNA that contains the genes responsible for the colour and shape of flowers is very variable between the two species of petunia. You could consider this section of DNA as a ""hotspot"" of genetic diversity compared to other less variable regions . The petunias available at garden centers are mostly derived from  a hybridization event (or genetic cross) between two wild varieties of petunia: Petunia axillaris and Petunia inflata. The hybrid petunia is, very appropriately, named Petunia hybrida. Over the years, many different varieties of petunia were created by further crossings between these hybrids and by the selection of particular desirable characterisitcs. A significantly larger number of genes from the white Petunia axillariswere found in the DNA of Petunia hybrida as compared to the number of genes from the purple Petunia inflata. The researchers state that this has something to do with the white-coloured flower of this species. The other flower colours probably show themselves more easily if plant breeders make use of the white variety in their breeding programmes. According to the researchers, Petunia axillaris is the evolutionary descendant of an ancestor that strongly resembled Petunia inflata. Theaxillaris-variety was the result of a mutation in the DNA that stopped the plant from producing the purple colouration. More or less at the same time, evolution resulted in the perfume of the plant to become stronger. This made the axillaris plants more attractive to moths, while the original inflata flowers were the favourite of bees. Paper in Nature Plants The paper in Nature Plants also shows that petunia is an excellent model system for further plant research. The plants are easy to grow, quickly produce a new generation, and mutations are easily produced and made visible - especially in the flowers. Petunia is also a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes important food crops such as tomatoes and potatoes. Because these plant species are related, researchers and plant breeders are now able to further investigate the functions of genes in the DNA of tomatoes and potatoes as a result of the mapped DNA of petunia. Also tomatoes Many different groups contributed to the unravelling of the petunia-DNA, each with their own interest in petunias. The Biosystematics group at Wageningen looked for 'traces' of duplication or triplication of the whole genome (all the DNA). They found evidence for a DNA-triplication that was also found in tomatoes, and that is regarded as Solanaceae family-specific. However, not all the same genes were lost in tomato or potato that were lost in petunia from a their common shared ancestor during the last 30 million years of evolution. Thus, much can be learned about how tomatoes and petunias came to be different. MiRNAs in petunia Together with the Plant Genetics group of the Radboud University, Nijmegen, the researchers also looked at small RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs) in petunia. MiRNAs are involved in controlling the activity of genes, particularly during the development of plants. They first determined which miRNAs were present in flower buds and then mapped the corresponding genes in the petunia DNA. The DNA sequences revealed that Petunia axillaris and Petunia inflata have many the same genes for miRNAs. This means that these genes already existed from before Petunia axillaris evolved from a Petunia inflata-like ancestor. Such genes that stay the same over a long period generally concern genes with an important function.","Published: June 10, 2016"

Collecting and analyzing saliva is a non-invasive, inexpensive method in the early detection of many types of cancer. Lung cancer patients can particularly benefit from this method as lung cancer tends to be diagnosed in advanced stages and may be mistaken for other problems. METHOD Researchers from the UCLA School of Dentistry and their collaborators performed a double-blind study on 37 people who have non-small cell lung cancer at three lung cancer centers in Chengdu, China. For each person, pre- and post-biopsy samples were collected for tissue and saliva cells. The researchers began by cataloging the biopsied plasma cells (from the lungs) using digital polymerase chain reaction. Next, the team cataloged the saliva cells using a proprietary UCLA-developed technology, called electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM) liquid biopsy, to see whether they could detect the same mutations as they did with the plasma cells. They were looking for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, which are early cellular signals for cancer. More specifically, they were looking for epidermal growth factor receptor L858R and exon 19del   two types of cancer mutations. FINDINGS The team found saliva detection correctly predicted the mutations in all 37 pre- and post-surgery saliva samples with 100 percent accuracy. The biopsied tissue predicted mutations with 70 percent accuracy. Furthermore, they found that the mutation signals in saliva were cleaner than in the biopsied tissue for L858R; and the tissue and saliva samples had clean separation for exon 19del.  This study has confirmed the performance of EFIRM liquid biopsy using as little as 40 microliters of saliva for detecting EGFR mutations,  said Dr. David Wong, lead author on the study and the associate dean for research at the UCLA School of Dentistry.  We are confident that EFIRM liquid biopsy is just as effective at detecting cancer mutations as the current dPCR method of testing tissue. The results from this study show that we are even closer to using saliva to detect cancer mutations; and that saliva can be just as accurate as tissue. ","Published: June 10, 2016"

The team is led by Stephen C. Harvey, PhD, an adjunct professor in the department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Penn. The scientists report in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B that DNA may go through a repetitive cycle of contraction and elongation, or as they put it,  scrunching,  to generate the forces required to drive the DNA into a virus during replication. A better understanding of viral reproduction could be the basis of new ways to fight infectious pathogens. During replication, viruses take over the host cell machinery to make copies of their genetic material and build protein shells called capsids to contain their genomic DNA or RNA. In some DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, the empty capsid forms first, and the DNA is then packaged by a protein ""motor"" on the capsid. In 2015, Harvey proposed that the traditional model in which the proteins push the DNA forward with a series of lever-like motions might be wrong. He suggested that the proteins might generate a cycle of DNA dehydration and rehydration. DNA is known to shorten by about 25 percent when it is dehydrated. He proposed that the resulting cycle of shortening and lengthening motions could be coupled to a DNA-protein grip-release cycle to generate forward motion. He called this the ""scrunchworm model.""  For some time now, we have been contemplating how viral DNA gets into the capsid so that one day we can block this step as a way to halt infection,  Harvey said. They tested the scrunchworm model in a series of computer simulations. The structures of the herpesviruses are not known with sufficient resolution to permit this kind of modeling, so the team examined DNA packaging in phi29, a DNA virus of similar structure that infects bacteria. They examined the interaction of DNA with the phi29 connector proteins, which form half of the protein motor. The DNA spontaneously underwent scrunching motions, without being pushed or pulled by protein levers. This provides the first support for the scrunchworm model. It is essential to test the scrunchworm model experimentally, and Harvey has formed a collaboration with two other research groups to test predictions made by the scrunchworm model. These involve grabbing a single viral particle with a pair of ""laser tweezers"" and pulling on the DNA tail as the DNA is packaged. The model predicts that DNAs with different sequences will generate different amounts of force, and that DNA with RNA inserts cannot be packaged.  Even if these experiments disprove the scrunchworm model, they will provide information that will help us figure out how these motors work,  Harvey said.  The purpose of modeling is to drive experiments and simulations that advance our understanding, regardless how they turn out.  This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01-GM070785) and the National Science Foundation.","Published: June 10, 2016"

To navigate the uncertainty posed by this fast-moving field of study and make informed decisions about the development and potential application of gene-drive modified organisms, the committee that conducted the study and wrote the report recommended a collaborative, multidisciplinary, and cautionary approach to research on and governance of gene drive technologies. Gene drives are systems of biased inheritance that enhance a genetic element's ability to pass from parent organism to offspring.  With the advent of new, more efficient, and targeted gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, gene modifications can, in principle, be spread throughout a population of living organisms intentionally and quickly via a gene drive, circumventing traditional rules of inheritance and greatly increasing the odds that an altered gene spreads throughout a population.  Preliminary evidence suggests that gene drives developed in the laboratory could spread a targeted gene through nearly 100 percent of a population of yeast, fruit flies, or mosquitoes. Gene drives have the potential to address public health threats, conservation-related issues, agricultural pests, and other challenges.  For example, gene drives might be developed to modify organisms that carry infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, and Zika.  In agriculture, a gene drive might be used to control or alter organisms that damage crops or carry crop disease.  On the other hand, some gene-drive modified organisms might lead to unintended consequences, such as the unintentional disruption of a non-target species or the establishment of a second, more resilient invasive species.  The science and technology associated with gene drives is developing very quickly,  said committee co-chair James P. Collins, Virginia M. Ullman Professor of Natural History and the Environment in the School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University.  But before gene-drive modified organisms are put into the environment, our committee urges caution   a lot more research is needed to understand the scientific, ethical, regulatory, and social consequences of releasing such organisms.  The remaining gaps in our understanding of the biology of gene drives and the potential effects of gene-drive modified organisms on the environment are fundamental considerations in the development and release of gene-drive modified organisms, the report says.  Laboratory and field research is needed to refine gene drive mechanisms and better understand how gene drives work, from the molecular level through species and ecosystem levels.  Meeting this need will require collaboration among multiple fields of study including molecular biology, population genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecology.  In addition, open-access, online data banks and standard operating procedures should be established to share information and guide research design.  Responsible research on gene drives and gene drive technology requires consideration of values and public engagement throughout the process,  said committee co-chair Elizabeth Heitman, associate professor of medical ethics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center s Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society.  From conducting basic research, to choosing a problem to address and an organism to modify, to devising strategies to pursue field testing safely, it is essential to examine each gene drive on a case-by-case basis and to engage stakeholders and the public in assessing their potential development.  The committee recommended a phased testing approach to gene drive research to guide research from the laboratory to the field.  Because the goal of using a gene drive is to spread genetic information throughout a population rapidly, it is difficult to anticipate its impact and important to minimize the potential for unintended consequences.  Phased testing can facilitate evidence-based decision making, with every step promoting careful study and evaluation. Each proposed field test or environmental release of a gene-drive modified organism should be subject to robust ecological risk assessment before being approved, the report says.  These assessments, which take into account the gene drive s characteristics, effects on humans and the environment, and local values and governance, are a key tool for determining a gene drive s impacts.  As of May 2016, no ecological risk assessment has been conducted for a gene-drive modified organism. Public engagement can help frame and define the potential harms and potential benefits of using a gene-drive modified organism, and must be built into risk assessment and practical decision making.  The outcomes of public engagement may be as crucial as scientific outcomes in making decisions about whether or not to release a gene-drive modified organism into the environment.  The report recommends that the governing authorities, including research institutions, funders, and regulators, develop and maintain clear policies and mechanisms for how public engagement will factor into research, ecological risk assessments, and public policy decisions about gene drives. The report finds that the current regulatory practices for assessing risks or potential environmental effects of field experiments or planned releases are inadequate for gene drives. At present, the regulation of gene drive research does not fit within the purview of any of the U.S. agencies involved in the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, which includes the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Gene drive research also raises regulatory concerns about biosafety, biosecurity, and the potential for this technology intended for human benefit to be intentionally misused for harmful purposes. The report calls for flexible and rapidly adaptable governance policies, such as the World Health Organization s Guidance Framework for Testing of Genetically Modified Mosquitoes, to facilitate international coordination and collaboration.  In selecting sites for potential field testing and environmental releases, the committee recommended that preference be given to locations in countries with existing scientific capacity and governance frameworks to conduct and oversee the safe investigation of gene drives and the development of gene-drive modified organisms. The scientific community   including researchers, institutions, and those who fund the research   must engage with policymakers on best practices to prevent misuse of gene-drive modified organisms.

However, only 200 of them have been categorized   leaving a genetic soup of 1,800 others for scientists and genetic counselors to figure out. A new study led by researchers at Children s Hospital Los Angeles and the Genetic Disease Screening Program of the California Department of Public Health sheds light on some of those genetic mutations and the impact for those who carry them.  The retrospective assessment of children in California   screened between 2007 and 2011, and followed for two to six years   was recently published by PLOS One.   CF is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, in the United States alone about 12 million people are carriers, and every year 2,500 babies are born with the disease which occurs when the child inherits two defective genes.  CF causes a thick, buildup of mucus in the lungs, clogging the airways and trapping bacteria.  This leads to infections, extensive lung damage and eventually, respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients. Because of the benefits of early diagnosis and the benefits of early nutritional treatments, mandatory newborn screening for CF is conducted throughout the U.S. and other countries.  But with so many mutations identified to date in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene   and contributions to the disease undefined for most   providers, including doctors, genetic counselors and worried parents alike, are not always sure to how to interpret screening results. California began newborn screening for CF in July 2007.  To address the challenges of screening in such an ethnically diverse state, a three-step model was adopted that includes CFTR DNA sequencing in order to explore the full range of the CF spectrum and help scientists to understand the various mutations and their clinical significance.  The three genotype groups created for this study were: those with two CF-causing mutations; those with one mutation of varying clinic consequences (VCC) and those with one mutation of unknown liability (Unknown).  Our study focused on children who have one CF-causing mutation and a second of varying or unknown clinical consequences, and followed them over time to see which mutations eventually resulted in disease symptoms and those that resulted in no disease,  said first author Danieli B. Salinas, MD, of CHLA s Division of Pulmonology. While most infants with VCC and unknown CFTR mutations do not meet diagnostic criteria for CF, a small proportion do. The results of the cohort study showed that about 5 percent of VCC and 11 percent of Unknown developed CF.  Children s carrying Unknown mutations were determined to be at risk, while other mutations were benign.  It is vital to determine and identify these mutations, because if we know the specific genetic mutation that causes the disease, we can possibly correct it,  said Salinas.  She added that nine different mutations, or about 4 percent of the population with CF, can be treated with a drug called Kalydeco, while another drug, Orkambi, effectively treats about 70 percent of CF patients   each by targeting a specific, known genetic mutation.  If we know early, we can make a significant difference in the life of a child with CF.  On the other hand, if parents know that the mutation has been found to be benign, meaning the infant has been screened with a positive genetic profile for CF, but not the disease, it saves them considerable worry, and they know their baby no longer has to be seen for follow-up tests, Salinas added. Specifically, the study results showed that children carrying previously unclassified mutations 2215insG with D836Y, and T1036N had early and classical CF characteristics; while others carrying 1525-42G>A, L320V, L967S, R170H, and 296+28A>G were benign, suggesting that these are non-CF causing mutations.","Published: June 10, 2016"

Concussions account for at least 75 percent of these injuries. Diagnosing concussion is based on assessing symptoms; there is no objective biomarker or test. Symptoms can vary widely--lasting for just seconds or sometimes not appearing for days or weeks after injury. Common symptoms including seizures, trouble sleeping, decreased coordination, repeated vomiting or nausea, confusion, and slurred speech. ""While most people think of concussions as a mild and short-lived injury, 15 to 30 percent of patients are left with symptoms that persist indefinitely,"" said Sara Strauss, MD, the study's lead author and resident in the department of radiology at Montefiore. ""Until now, we haven't had a reliable way to differentiate in advance those who may be burdened long-term and those who would have a complete recovery."" Conventional imaging techniques, such as CT scans and MRI, cannot detect the subtle damage to axons (the nerve fibers that constitute the brain's white matter) that is associated with concussions. But in a previous study, Dr. Lipton and his colleagues demonstrated that an advanced form of MRI called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect concussion-related damage to axons. It does so by ""seeing"" the movement of water molecules along axons, which allows researchers to measure the uniformity of water movement (called fractional anisotropy, or FA) throughout the brain. Finding a low FA brain region, for example, indicates structural damage that has impeded water movement in that area. Don't Miss: Portable, low-cost optical imaging tool found to be useful in concussion evaluation In the current study, Dr. Lipton tested whether brain abnormalities identified on DTI of individual concussion patients could distinguish between those patients who will eventually recover and those who will not. DTI was performed on 39 patients diagnosed with mild TBI by an emergency room physician within 16 days of the initial injury and on 40 healthy controls. The DTI image of each patient was compared with images for the entire group of healthy controls to see where patients' brains were abnormal. Patients were also assessed for three measures: cognitive function, post-concussion symptoms and health-related quality of life measures. A year later, 26 of the concussion patients returned for follow-up assessments. DTI imaging comparing concussion patients and healthy controls revealed two types of white-matter abnormalities in patients: (1) areas of abnormally low FA (red, in the above image) that correlate with axon damage and the cognitive impairment that can affect concussion patients; and (2) other brain areas with abnormally high FA (blue) that may indicate where the brain has responded favorably to injury, perhaps by more efficiently connecting axons or by remyelinating injured tissue (i.e., forming fatty tissue around nerves, which allows nerve impulses to move more quickly). The amount of high FA imaged in brains predicted patients' outcomes following concussion. Having a greater volume of abnormally high FA white-matter areas (perhaps indicating good compensation for concussion damage) was associated with better outcomes on follow-up assessments. (This doesn't mean that the low FA areas showing white-matter damage aren't important just that they're not useful in predicting recovery from concussion a year later). Learn More: Does concussion impact men and women differently? ""Being able to predict which patients have a good or bad prognosis has tremendous implications for discovering and evaluating treatments for concussion,"" said Dr. Lipton. ""Developing an effective intervention requires first identifying the people who need it. Seventy to 85 percent of concussion patients get better by themselves, which makes it difficult to learn whether any treatment is actually helping. Our imaging technique allows researchers to test potential therapies on those concussion patients who can truly benefit from them."" Dr. Lipton noted that most therapies tried so far for TBI have focused on reducing damage from brain injury or preventing an injury from progressing, but none has proven effective. ""Our findings,"" he said, ""suggest that it might be worthwhile to try a different strategy namely, attempting to enhance the brain's innate abilities to compensate functionally and structurally for whatever damage has been done."" Dr. Lipton cautions that further studies are needed to validate this approach for predicting concussion outcomes. ""While we were able to predict the outcomes for the patients in our study; more refined approaches incorporating additional patient and injury characteristics, for example may be needed when applying the test on widely differing individuals.

Patients whose systolic blood pressure was reduced rapidly in emergency rooms to standard levels used to treat acute stroke (140-179 mm Hg) did as well as patients whose pressure was reduced to intensive levels (110-139 mm Hg). The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was funded by the (U.S.) National Institute of Health's (NIH s) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified  For decades, doctors wondered whether intensive blood pressure management was more effective than standard treatment for controlling intracerebral hemorrhage,  said Adnan I Qureshi, MD, professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Radiology, Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, the principal investigator of the study.  Our results may help patients and their doctors make better treatment decisions.  Annually, more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke. Approximately 10 percent of strokes are caused by acute intracerebral hemorrhages. Chronic high blood pressure is the greatest risk factor for these types of strokes. Studies have shown that controlling blood pressure reduces the chances of having all types of strokes. Although this type of stroke is associated with higher rates of death or disability than the more common form caused by brain blood clots, there is a need for scientifically proven emergency treatments for hemorrhage strokes. Elevated blood pressure is thought to contribute to growth of the hemorrhage, or the leak, and worse outcomes. Some studies have suggested that rapid, intensive blood pressure lowering may lead to better outcomes. Nonetheless, the ideal target blood pressure to minimize hemorrhage growth safely and effectively has not been established. The Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH II) trial addressed this issue by randomly assigning 1,000 participants with elevated blood pressure following their stroke to either standard or intensive blood pressure treatments used for acute stroke. The participants, who on average were 62 years old, were treated within four and a half hours of a stroke at medical centers in the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Germany On average, the participants entered the trial with a blood pressure level of 200.6 mm Hg. Their high levels were lowered by intravenous injections of nicardipine, a blood pressure medication.  Overall the standard and intensive blood pressure treatment levels were higher than normal (120 mm Hg or less).  Rapidly lowering blood pressure to normal levels may further damage the brain,  said Dr. Qureshi.  The levels we used are tolerable for emergencies. Normal levels can be safely obtained gradually.  Brain scans taken 24 hours after treatment showed no difference in the rates of hemorrhage growth between the two groups. The results also showed that after 90 days the rate of death or severe disability was equal, about 38 percent, for either treatment. Patients in the intensive treatment group had a slightly higher rate of serious adverse events in the 90 days following the stroke.  The NIH is committed to saving lives and rescuing stroke patients from life-long disability,  said Walter J Koroshetz, MD, director of the NINDS.  Studies like ATACH II provide doctors with the most rigorously tested information to guide emergency treatment options.  Learn More: Images of brain after mild stroke predict future risk The study was designed to enroll 1,280 patients; the researchers stopped the trial after analyzing data from the first 1,000 patients, however, because they saw no differences between the treatments. The 90-day death and severe disability rates of this study were lower than those seen in other hemorrhagic stroke studies, 38 percent versus an expected rate of 60 percent. The researchers suggested that the difference may be due to including patients who had relatively minor strokes and therefore a better chance of good results. Initial patient examinations showed that over half had mild stroke as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale. The researchers also suggested that, by participating in the trial, the patients received better overall care.  Although additional studies are needed, we may have seen a global benefit of careful monitoring and standardized care for patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage,  said Dr. Qureshi.

Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered how those differences are reflected in brain activity. When the researchers asked people to cooperate with a partner and then tracked the brain activity of both participants, they found that males and females had different patterns of brain activity. Learn More: Neural fundamentals: Sex differences in the nervous system The new findings published in Scientific Reports could offer some clues into how cooperative behavior may have evolved differently between males and females, and could eventually help researchers develop new ways to enhance cooperative behavior. ""It's not that either males or females are better at cooperating or can't cooperate with each other,"" said the study's senior author, Allan Reiss, MD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and of radiology. ""Rather, there's just a difference in how they're cooperating."" Cooperation between family members, friends, coworkers and even governments around the world is viewed as a cornerstone of human society. But not everyone cooperates equally, as anyone who's worked on a group project knows. And one factor shaping a person's approach to cooperation: sex. Previous behavioral studies have found that women cooperate more when they're being watched by other women; that men tend to cooperate better in large groups; and that while a pair of men might cooperate better than a pair of women, in a mixed-sex pair the woman tends to be more cooperative. Theories have circulated about why this is, but the brain science behind them has been scarce. ""A vast majority of what we know comes from very sterile, single-person studies done in an MRI machine,"" said Joseph Baker, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford and a lead author of the study. The other lead author is research associate Ning Liu, PhD. To figure out how cooperation is reflected in the brains of men and women who are actively cooperating rather than just thinking about cooperating while lying in a machine the Stanford researchers turned to a technique called hyperscanning. Hyperscanning involves simultaneously recording the activity in two people's brains while they interact. And instead of using an MRI that requires participants to lie perfectly still and flat, the scientists used near-infrared spectroscopy, or NIRS, in which probes are attached to a person's head to record brain function, allowing them to sit upright and interact more naturally. See Also: Sex differences in brain may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders more common in males The 222 participants in the study were each assigned a partner. Pairs consisted of two males, two females or a male and a female. Then, while wearing the NIRS probes, each person sat in front a computer, across the table from their partner. Partners could see each other, but were instructed not to talk. Instead, they were asked to press a button when a circle on the computer screen changed color. The goal: to press the button simultaneously with their partner. After each try, the pair were told who had pressed the button sooner and how much sooner. They had 40 tries to get their timing as close as possible. ""We developed this test because it was simple, and you could easily record responses,"" said Reiss. ""You have to start somewhere."" It isn't modeled after any particular real-world cooperative task, he said. On average, male-male pairs performed better than female-female pairs at timing their button pushes more closely, the researchers found. However, the brain activity in both same-sex pairs was highly synchronized during the activity, meaning they had high levels of ""interbrain coherence."" ""Within same-sex pairs, increased coherence was correlated with better performance on the cooperation task,"" Baker said., ""However, the location of coherence differed between male-male and female-female pairs."" Surprisingly, though, male-female pairs did as well as male-male pairs at the cooperation task, even though they didn't show coherence. Since the brains of males and females showed different patterns of activity during the exercise, more research might shed light on how sex-related differences in the brain inform cooperation strategy -- at least when it comes to this particular type of cooperation. ""This study is pretty exploratory,"" Baker said. ""This certainly isn't probing cooperation in all its manifestations."" There could be other cooperative tasks, for instance, in which female-female pairs best males. And the researchers noted they hadn't measured activity in all parts of the brain. ""There are a lot of parts of the brain we didn't assess,"" Reiss said, pointing out that interbrain coherence may have been present in other regions of the brain that weren't examined during the task. Learn More: New insights into the male bias of autism As they continue to study what in the brain underlies cooperation, the scientists' results could help explain how cooperation evolved in humans -- and whether cooperation was selected for differently in males and females as well as inform methods that use biofeedback to teach cooperation skills.

The Metabolic Profiling CCS Library includes more than 900 measurements of collision cross-section (CCS) values, which measure the gas phase three-dimensional shape of a molecule for an additional identification coordinate used to confirm analytical results. The library also includes more than 600 MS/MS spectra. The library is included in Waters  UNIFI  Scientific Information System, the company s unique software platform that combines instrument control and data analysis, visualization, and management of both chromatography and mass spectrometry results. The library is also available for use with Progenesis  QI Software. The new resource was announced at the 64th American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) meeting. The Metabolic Profiling CCS Library enables research scientists to accurately identify biomarkers in complex sample matrices when using ion mobility separations. A collisional cross section (CCS) value is a precise physicochemical property of an ion related to its size, shape, and charge in the gas phase. In untargeted metabolomics studies involving small sample amounts that are highly complex, researchers can use CCS values in the library to confirm identifications of endogenous metabolites and lipids showing statistically significant changes between different sample groups.  Metabolomics and lipidomics are critical techniques for biomarker discovery and translational research, whether identifying endogenous biomarkers of interest for efficacy, or understanding disease progression. Ion mobility mass spectrometry is an enabling technology for performing untargeted metabolomics studies where the researcher wants to learn as much as possible about the underlying biology. Where ion mobility increases overall chromatographic peak capacity, CCS values improve confidence that a researcher has correctly identified a particular metabolite/s,  commented David Heywood, senior business development manager for Waters  omics solutions. The Metabolic Profiling CCS Library for UNIFI is available with the Vion  IMS QT of and SYNAPT  G2-Si HDMS  Systems, high-resolution mass spectrometers that reduce the complexities of executing ion mobility-based analyses. When used in conjunction with Progenesis QI Software, which aids in the identification of compounds that are significantly changing in a sample, the technologies enable researchers in biomarker identification to robustly and routinely mine complex samples with high coverage and statistical rigor.","Published: June 9, 2016"

When paired with the correct vector technology, a GS Null cell line increases the stringency of selection and enables identification of clones expressing biotherapeutic product at commercially viable levels, with reduced timelines and without the need for toxic Methionine Sulphoximine (MSX) as a selection agent. Biomanufacturing in CHO cells is performed based on high-expressing clones, the identification of which can be streamlined through the use of metabolic selection. Glutamine is an amino acid required for cellular viability and the only source of glutamine production in the cell is through the enzymatic action of Glutamine Synthetase (GS). MSX inhibits GS activity in cells so that only those clones that are most efficient at producing recombinant protein are able to proliferate. A major drawback with this approach however, is that MSX is toxic and requires removal during product purification. A preferred approach is to start with a cell line that lacks GS entirely (GS Null). When the gene for a biotherapeutic product is provided on a vector alongside GS, such as in the CHOGUN vector, production of GS is linked to the production of the protein of interest, and so cells that survive selection are more likely to be expressing the product at high levels. The CHOGUN vector has been developed as part of the ProteoNic 2G UNic  technology which comprises proprietary mammalian expression vectors and plug-in elements that affect different aspects of the protein production pathway. The combination of elements in the 2G UNic vectors provide a synergistic enhancement enabling the generation of high yield stable cell lines. Paul Morrill, President, Products at Horizon Discovery Group commented:  Horizon s GS Null CHO cell line, generated through the Company s gene editing platform, has undergone extensive validation to confirm its suitability for biomanufacturing. By including ProteoNic s powerful expression vector, we are now able to offer customers a complete platform that showcases the full capabilities of these cells.  Victor Schut, Chief Business Officer, ProteoNic said:  The CHOGUN vector has proven to be extremely effective in a variety of cell lines including Horizon s GS Null CHO cell line. We are excited to offer it to Horizon s customers, providing another channel to access the 2G UNic technology for improved recombinant protein production. We believe that this platform is an attractive alternative for any other therapeutics, including biosimilars, producing system in the market today. We look forward to continuing to work together on future projects. ","Published: June 9, 2016"

Based on the recent outcomes from the phase III, prospective, randomized MINDACT trial, it is safe to withhold chemotherapy in MammaPrint Low Risk patients, even in the presence of high risk clinical factors. Agendia, Inc., a world leader in personalized medicine and molecular cancer diagnostics, has presented new prospective data for its MammaPrint  70-gene breast cancer recurrence assay at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois. Results from the Prospective study Of MammaPrint in breast cancer patients with an Intermediate recurrence Score (PROMIS) show that MammaPrint can provide clear guidance on whether a patient should receive chemotherapy, compared to the indeterminate results from 21-gene assay (OncotypeDx). MammaPrint provides a definitive, binary High or Low Risk result for a patient s cancer recurring and thus whether the patient needs more aggressive, or less aggressive therapy. Between 38-67% of women tested in different studies using the 21-gene assay were classified as having an intermediate/indeterminate Recurrence Score (between 18 and 30).1 PROMIS evaluated 840 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, lymph node (LN) positive or LN negative women across 58 US institutions who had previously received an intermediate/indeterminate risk score from the 21-gene assay. Patient samples were re-tested using MammaPrint to refine the risk classification and provide additional treatment guidance. Of the 840 intermediate risk patients, MammaPrint reclassified 55% (466) of these patients as High Risk and 45% (374) as Low Risk of the individual s cancer recurring. No correlation between definitive MammaPrint results or the indeterminate 21-gene assay Recurrence Score could be identified, reinforcing the discordance between these assays and inability to use the results interchangeably. MammaPrint was shown to provide additional prognostic information independent from clinicopathological factors to support the treatment decision. Based on the outcome of the MammaPrint test, 34% (282/840) of physicians changed their treatment decisions, preventing both under and over treatment: 37% (171/466) of the high risk patients had chemotherapy added to their treatment recommendation and 29% (108/374) of the low risk patients had chemotherapy removed from their treatment recommendation. Of the MammaPrint Low Risk patients who were previously indicated to receive chemotherapy based on the 21-gene assay results, 76% of patients (108/142) decided to forego chemotherapy, preventing unnecessary overtreatment in this group. Medical oncologist Dr. Michaela Tsai from the Virginia Piper Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN and primary author of the PROMIS poster commented,  Of 466 intermediate patients reclassified as High Risk by MammaPrint, 342 have an Recurrence Score  25 and were not recommended for chemotherapy by St. Gallen Guidelines (Goldhirsch, Winer et al. 2013), risking up to a 73% chance of under-treatment.  She also noted,  79% of physicians reported that they had greater confidence in their treatment recommendations with MammaPrint.  Dr. William Audeh, Chief Medical Officer of Agendia said:  The clinical performance of MammaPrint and its ability to accurately inform and guide treatment decisions has been definitively proven by the recent presentation of the MINDACT trial at the 2016 AACR meeting. This unique phase III prospective, randomized, controlled study provides the highest level of clinical evidence to MammaPrint above any other genomic assay for making adjuvant therapy decisions in early-stage breast cancer.  MINDACT included 6,693 patients and is a phase III, prospective, randomized controlled, clinical trial comparing the use of MammaPrint 70-gene assay with clinicopathological criteria (current standard of care) for selecting early-stage breast cancer patients who should be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.  The PROMIS trial showed the positive impact a binary test could have in the clinical setting by providing a clear risk assessment of the patient to physicians  said Mark Straley, Chief Executive Officer at Agendia.  MammaPrint is the only FDA-cleared assay for early-stage breast cancer patients of all ages, further validating the quality and clinical utility of the test. ","Published: June 9, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-new-approach-to-chemical-synthesis-186532,A New Approach to Chemical Synthesis Communesins  originally found in fungus  could hold potential as cancer drugs  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. MIT chemists have devised a new way to synthesize a complex molecular structure that is shared by a group of fungal compounds with potential as anticancer agents. Known as communesins, these compounds have shown particular promise against leukemia cells but may be able to kill other cancer cells as well. The new synthesis strategy, described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, should enable researchers to generate large enough quantities of these compounds to run more tests of their anticancer activity. It should also allow scientists to produce designed variants of the naturally occurring communesins, which may be even more potent.  This is just the foundation,  says Mohammad Movassaghi, an MIT professor of chemistry and the paper s senior author.  We ve laid the foundation for implementation of this strategy to access other variations, both natural and nonnatural.  Communesins are a unique family of polycyclic and complex naturally occurring alkaloids. One of the major hurdles to synthesizing communesins in the lab using this new strategy is a chemical reaction in which two large, bulky molecules must be joined together in a step known as heterodimerization. Movassaghi s lab, which has been working on this type of synthesis for several years, was inspired by the way related compounds are produced in nature. The details of the natural synthesis are not fully known, but it is believed that it also involves a heterodimerization step. In fungi, there is evidence that an enzyme catalyzes this reaction. Without an enzyme, the heterodimerization required to produce communesins is difficult to carry out because it requires forming a bond between two carbon atoms that are each already bonded to four other atoms, some of which have additional bulky groups attached to them. This makes it challenging to bring the two molecules close enough for them to fuse together. To overcome this, Movassaghi s lab developed an approach in which they transform the two carbon atoms into carbon radicals (carbon atoms with one unpaired electron). To create these radicals, the researchers first attach each of the targeted carbon atoms to a nitrogen atom, and these two nitrogen atoms bind to each other. When the researchers shine certain wavelengths of light on the reactants, it causes the two atoms of nitrogen to break away as nitrogen gas, leaving behind two very reactive carbon radicals that join together almost immediately.  If you break the carbon-nitrogen bond, the intermediate has a very short lifetime. We predict it to be roughly on the order of picoseconds,  Movassaghi says.  Dinitrogen pops out and now you have two radicals in very close proximity.  Once the heterodimer is formed, three more chemical steps are required, including the transfer of a nitrogen-containing chemical group from one carbon atom to another.  Just heterodimerizing is only half the battle,  Movassaghi says.  There were two major challenges in this successful synthesis. One was how do you get to a heterodimer, and once you fuse the two halves together, how do you guide the rearrangement to match the structure that you find in nature?  In this study, the MIT team prepared a key precursor that was converted to the compound known as communesin F in only five steps. The critical heterodimer rearrangement step proceeded to yield 82 percent of the desired heptacyclic communesin structure. Scott Miller, a professor of chemistry at Yale University, describes the new approach as  a masterful synthesis.   The strategy is incredibly ambitious and reflects a sophisticated assessment of the plausible biosynthetic precursor. This is really very clever, since these pathways are typically not known at the level of complete understanding, so outstanding intuition and creativity are required,  says Miller, who was not involved in the research. This strategy can also be used to produce related communesins, including variants not found in nature.  Nature has likely evolved these compounds for chemical defense or signaling between different organisms, but if we re thinking about their potential for treatment of human disease, we may need to access nonnatural derivatives,  Movassaghi says.  Our ability to go in with pinpoint accuracy and make structural variations to these complex alkaloids is going to be helpful in enabling the thorough evaluation of these compounds and related derivatives.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. In line with the Danish Takeover Order, which requires the extension of an offer period in case of changing offer terms and conditions, QIAGEN N.V. is further extending the offer period, which will now expire on 22 June 2016 at 23:59 (CET). On 3 June 2016, QIAGEN N.V. had extended the conditional voluntary offer and announced that the Company has already received acceptances representing 89.21% of the share capital and voting rights in Exiqon. In addition to the acceptances received and as described in the Offer Document, QIAGEN N.V. had also announced that members of the Executive Management in aggregate hold 4,021,959 warrants in Exiqon which are convertible into the same number of Exiqon shares (just below 1% of outstanding shares following conversion). Such warrants are expected to vest immediately upon Completion, if any, of the Offer and can either be settled in cash or in shares depending on the decision by Exiqon s Board of Directors. QIAGEN N.V. has received irrevocable undertakings from these warrant holders, stating that they will tender any newly issued shares to QIAGEN N.V. at the Offer Price in case the Board of Directors decides that such warrants should be settled in shares.

The standard method of culturing can take days to reveal pathogens, and they often fail to bring them to light altogether. A team lead by Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University now reports a method in PLoS, which enables the rapid isolation and concentration of infectious bacteria from complex clinical samples to help speed up bacterial identification, and it should be able to accelerate the determination of antibiotic susceptibilities as well. ""We leveraged FcMBL   the genetically engineered pathogen-binding protein we developed for our sepsis therapeutic device program   to develop a fast and simple technology to help overcome this diagnostic roadblock,  said Ingber, who is the Wyss Institute s Founding Director, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  Using clinical samples of joint fluids, we were able to show that this method can be used to quickly and efficiently isolate bacterial pathogens for various kinds of subsequent analysis, including PCR, which is commonly used for molecular diagnostics in clinical laboratories.  FcMBL is a recombinant form of the human blood protein, Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL), fused to a portion of the antibody Fc domain. The engineered protein can bind to more than 90 different microbial pathogens and toxins, ranging from fungi to bacteria, viruses and parasites and it even binds antibiotic-resistant organisms. Earlier studies by Ingber s team have used FcMBL as the key component of a dialysis-like blood cleansing device for sepsis therapy. The Wyss Institute s efforts focusing on pathogen capture in different applications are funded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA). ""Given our exciting results pulling pathogens out of flowing blood using FcMBL, we asked whether we could also capture live bacteria from clinical samples for detailed molecular analysis,"" said Michael Super, Ph.D., a Wyss Senior Staff Scientist who helped lead this research effort. As a starting point, the team investigated samples obtained from patients with infections of joints or joint replacements, where the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus can lead to painful inflammation or form bacterial biofilms that often render artificial surfaces into health hazards, leading to joint failure or sepsis. ""We showed that FcMBL-coated magnetic beads bound to 12 clinical S. aureus isolates after these were cultured from infected joint fluids and that we could isolate them using magnets; however, in our initial studies, the FcMBL-beads did not bind S. aureus directly in infected joint fluids. We then realized that immune cells and factors in patient samples mask the sugar molecules on bacteria that FcMBL usually binds to. This, together with the viscous nature of the complex clinical samples impeded the efficacy of the fusion protein,"" said Super. The team remedied both problems with a cocktail of enzymes. When joint samples are pre-treated with this cocktail, protease enzymes eliminated the interfering immune factors to expose bacterial surface sugars for FcMBL binding, while another enzyme in the mix, hyaluronidase, breaks down a class of large polymers that are responsible for the high viscosity of joint fluids. ""Using this approach, we were able to isolate and concentrate pathogenic S. aureus cells in only 2 hours, which could make a tremendous difference in clinical settings, especially in cases where pathogens can not be cultured straight out of the sample. This could let us fast-track the best antimicrobial treatment option in often critical situations,"" said Alain Bicart-See, M.D. the study s first author who as a Wyss Institute Visiting Scholar collected the samples at Hospital Joseph-Ducuing in Toulouse, France where he specializes in infectious diseases. After their isolation, pathogenic bacteria can be molecularly identified with methods that either look for the presence of DNA snippets specific for candidate pathogens or identified by mass spectrometry, a technique that can survey all pathogenic proteins present in a sample. The Wyss researchers also think that the method will facilitate antibiotic susceptibility testing since bacteria retrieved with the method are alive. ""This isolation technique should be able to be used to rapidly identify pathogens in other clinical samples including blood, urine, sputum, and cerebral spinal fluid, and thus, it will hopefully shorten the time required for physicians to select the optimal therapy. In addition to saving more lives, this new method also should reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies, or suboptimal regimens, and thereby, decrease development of antibiotic-resistant organisms that become a more general threat in the long run,"" said Ingber.","Published: June 9, 2016"

Buzz... SLAP! Mosquitoes are coming and they're out for blood. With summer on the way and fears about Zika virus spreading worldwide, mosquito control is top of mind for anyone planning to enjoy the great outdoors as the weather warms up. Repellents are the first line of defense against mosquito bites and the diseases they spread, but they aren't without drawbacks. Topical products applied to skin wear off within hours, and neurotoxin-based sprays often present health hazards. Enter a ""spatial"" repellent, which reduces contact between disease-spreading insects and humans by creating an invisible barrier that inhibits the ability of the insect to locate and land on a target. Sterling International, Inc., the company behind RESCUE!  insect traps and attractants, has expanded their product line to include spatial insect repellents, including a new wearable repellent device called GoClip . The active ingredients in GoClip  are all-natural essential oils that serve as a spatial repellent to keep insects away. The oils are infused into a porous core that allows a controlled release over a 48-hour period. That core is housed in a metallic plastic cover with a clip that easily attaches to a shirt collar, waistband, cargo shorts pocket, hat or lanyard. When GoClip  is worn, the fragrance, pleasant to humans, disperses into the air and helps shield the wearer from insect landings. The repellency lasts 48 hours total, or six days   based on 8 hours' use per day. When not in use, the resealable zippered pouch helps it maintain potency. The launch of the GoClip  follows years of development that began with a Department of Defense Grant awarded to Sterling in 2008 for a wearable ""personal insect repellent device"" to protect soldiers in the Middle East from mosquitoes and sandflies. Using the Gas Chromatography and Electro-Antennographic Detector (GC-EAD) in Sterling's insect research lab, in-house scientists   led by Director of Research Dr. Qing-He Zhang   identified natural repellents by observing how antennae of mosquitoes and other insects responded when exposed to different materials. By the end of the three-year research period, the company developed several prototypes ready for the DOD to field test. Besides the usefulness to the military, the device had obvious commercial appeal. ""We knew consumers would find value in a long-lasting repellent device that protects the space around them from not only mosquitoes, but also biting flies and ticks,"" explained Sterling President Rod Schneidmiller. ""There is nothing to spray or apply to your skin, and the combination of lemongrass, clove, peppermint and cinnamon oils is a pleasant scent."" The GoClip  retails for around $5 and is available nationwide at participating ACE Hardware, True Value and Do-it Best dealers, as well as on Amazon.com.","Published: June 9, 2016"

Along with other teams1, including one at the SOLEIL synchrotron, they propose the first realistic scenario for the formation of this key compound, which had never been detected in meteorites or cometary ices until now.  The genetic material of all living organisms on Earth, as well as of viruses, is made up of nucleic acids, DNA and RNA2. RNA, which is considered more primitive, is thought to have been one of the first molecules characteristic of life to appear on Earth. Scientists have long wondered about the origin of these biological compounds. Some of them believe that the Earth was seeded by comets or asteroids that contained the basic building blocks needed to form such molecules. And indeed several amino acids (the components of proteins) and nitrogenous bases (one of the components of nucleic acids) have already been found in meteorites, as well as in artificial comets produced in the laboratory3. However, ribose, the other key component of RNA, had never yet been detected in extraterrestrial material or created in the laboratory under 'astrophysical' conditions. Now, by simulating the evolution of the interstellar ice making up comets, French research teams have successfully obtained ribose, a key step in understanding the origin of RNA and therefore of life.  As a first step, an artificial comet was produced at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale. By placing a representative mixture of water (H2O), methanol (CH3OH) and ammonia (NH3) in a high vacuum chamber at   200  C, the astrophysicists simulated the formation of dust grains coated with ice, the raw material of comets. This material was irradiated with UV, as in the molecular clouds where these grains form. The sample was then warmed to room temperature, as in comets when they approach the Sun. Its composition was analyzed at the Institut de Chimie de Nice, optimizing an extremely sensitive and accurate method (multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry). Several sugars were detected, including ribose. Their diversity and relative abundances suggest that they were formed from formaldehyde (a molecule found in space and on comets that forms in large quantities from methanol and water). Although the existence of ribose in real comets remains to be confirmed, this discovery completes the list of the molecular building blocks of life that can be formed in interstellar ice. It also lends further support to the theory that comets are the source of the organic molecules that made life possible on Earth, and perhaps elsewhere in the Universe.  This study received financial support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche and the CNES (Centre National d' tudes Spatiales).","Published: June 9, 2016"

In a ""proof of concept"" study involving 236 subjects, the test demonstrated an overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rate of 100 percent in identifying subjects whose MCI was actually caused by an early stage of Alzheimer's disease.

""Our results show that it is possible to use a small number of blood-borne autoantibodies to accurately diagnose early-stage Alzheimer's. These findings could eventually lead to the development of a simple, inexpensive and relatively noninvasive way to diagnose this devastating disease in its earliest stages."" ""It is now generally believed that Alzheimer's-related changes begin in the brain at least a decade before the emergence of telltale symptoms,"" Nagele explained. ""To the best of our knowledge, this is the first blood test using autoantibody biomarkers that can accurately detect Alzheimer's at an early point in the course of the disease when treatments are more likely to be beneficial - that is, before too much brain devastation has occurred."" Nagele is the study's corresponding author and the director of the Biomarker Discovery Center at Rowan's New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging. He is also the co-founder and chief scientific officer of Durin Technologies, Inc. Don't Miss: Imaging test may identify biomarker of Alzheimer's diseaseThe researchers presented their results in an article published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring that also reported the test's ability to accurately ""stage the disease,"" meaning it can distinguish early-stage Alzheimer's at MCI from later, more advanced stages. The test was also disease-specific. It readily distinguished early Alzheimer's at the MCI stage from other diseases including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and early stage breast cancer. For the study, the Rowan University researchers analyzed blood samples from 236 subjects, including 50 MCI subjects with low levels of amyloid-beta 42 peptide in their cerebrospinal fluid. The latter is a reliable indicator of ongoing Alzheimer's pathology in the brain and predicts a likely rapid progression to Alzheimer's. Employing human protein microarrays, each containing 9,486 unique human proteins that are used as bait to attract blood-borne autoantibodies, the researchers identified the top 50 autoantibody biomarkers capable of detecting ongoing early-stage Alzheimer's pathology in patients with MCI. In multiple tests, the 50 biomarkers were 100 percent accurate in distinguishing patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's from healthy age- and gender-matched controls. Further testing of the selected MCI biomarker panel demonstrated similar high overall accuracy rates in differentiating patients with early Alzheimer's at the MCI stage from those with more advance, mild-moderate Alzheimer's (98.7 percent), early-stage Parkinson's disease (98.0 percent), multiple sclerosis (100 percent) and breast cancer (100 percent). Learn More: Odor biomarker for Alzheimer s disease In their report, the researchers acknowledge that the utility of their MCI biomarker panel as a blood test for early detection of Alzheimer's disease will hinge on a successful larger replication study using an independent patient cohort. However, they also point out that, because this blood-based diagnostic strategy is dependent on the presence of Alzheimer's pathology which can be underway many years before symptoms emerge, this approach could open the door to even earlier pre-symptomatic detection of Alzheimer's disease. According to the authors, early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the ability to stage the disease through a simple blood test would offer many potential benefits. Patients could possibly delay disease progression through lifestyle adjustments, begin treatment sooner and plan future medical care. Clinicians would have a way to measure the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention and clinical trials could enroll patients who were truly at the earliest stage of their disease.

A large sample size of high school seniors also meant researchers could separate doctor-prescribed ADHD medication use by gender. The results show no gender differences in the overall associations between stimulant medication therapy for ADHD and risk of substance use, said Sean Esteban McCabe, a research professor at the U-M Institute for Research on Women and Gender.

The oral drug, dimethylfumarate, or DMF, and its metabolite, monomethylfumarate, or MMF, both increase activity of Nrf2, a protein that helps protect the body from oxidative stress and inflammation, hallmarks of both diseases, said Dr. Bobby Thomas, neuroscientist in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. See Also: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity But the new study provides the first evidence that the metabolite, which is essentially the active portion of the parent drug, more directly targets Nrf2, potentially reducing known side effects of the parent drug that include flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and the brain infection encephalopathy, said Thomas, corresponding author of the study in The Journal of Neuroscience. Particularly, the gastrointestinal side effects can exacerbate some problems patients with Parkinson's already experience, said Dr. John Morgan, neurologist, neuroscientist and Parkinson's disease specialist in the MCG Department of Neurology. In addition to destroying neurons in the brain that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that enables movement and learning, Parkinson's causes nerve cell death in the gastrointestinal tract and related problems such as severe constipation. ""Nrf2 is a natural protective mechanism we have for oxidative stress,"" Thomas said. The fact that multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's have in common evidence of declining activity of the Nrf2 pathway has generated interest in the drug for Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. DMF was approved for multiple sclerosis three years ago by the Food and Drug Administration (US). While its metabolite MMF is not quite as potent as the parent drug in increasing Nrf2 activity, the new study indicates that its action is sufficient to dramatically slow the loss of dopamine-producing neurons as well as the parent drug, in an animal model of Parkinson's. In their model, mice given the neurotoxin MPTP experience a dramatic loss of dopamine-producing neurons, losing about half within a handful of days, and rapidly develop Parkinson's-like symptoms. Patients, on the other hand, slowly develop symptoms over many years. By the time they seek medical care, patients may have lost 30-50 percent of their dopaminergic neurons, said Morgan, a study coauthor.

Learn More: New lead for potential Parkinson s treatment: Effects of high-risk Parkinson s mutation are reversible To accommodate the very compressed timeline in their model and the fact that several daily doses are needed before the drug starts to work, the researchers first gave the mice either the drug or metabolite the day before they started the toxin. Dopamine-producing neurons are located in a darker-pigmented central portion of the brain called the substantia nigra. Even in the absence of disease, making dopamine is a stressful job for these neurons that makes them generally more fragile and actually results in oxidative stress even in a healthy scenario, Morgan said. To make a difficult situation worse, increased oxidative stress can make dopamine toxic to neurons, he said. To increase Nrf2 activity, the parent drug DMF also appears to first make bad matters worse. DMF increases oxidative stress by depleting the natural antioxidant, glutathione, and reduces the power of cell powerhouses, called mitochondria, by limiting their ability to use oxygen and glucose to make energy leading to reduced viability of dopamine-producing cells, Thomas said. The metabolite MMF appears to more directly activate Nrf2, and actually increases glutathione and improves mitochondrial function, brain cell studies showed. While the parent drug ultimately produces a higher Nrf2 activation, the researchers found the MMF effect was sufficient to stop the dramatic neuron loss in the animal model. Both DMF and MMF slowed neuron loss to a more normal level, and the neurons that survived continued to make dopamine. Inflammation and oxidative stress levels also were significantly reduced, the researchers said. As a next step, they are working toward a clinical trial of MMF in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Although the metabolite could be easily formulated for humans, it has not yet been done, Thomas notes. ""If we can catch them early enough, maybe we can slow the disease,"" Morgan said. ""If it can help give five to eight more years of improved quality of life that would be great for our patients."" Clinical studies of the drug in Parkinson's are being planned in the United Kingdom and additional analogues of its metabolite, which could be used clinically and which the researchers think ultimately will be the best option for patients, are under development. Oxidative stress is a byproduct of the body's use of oxygen. Free radicals, generated by oxygen use, are unstable molecules that can interfere with usual cell function and are believed to contribute to a wide range of conditions from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease. Simply giving antioxidants, such as vitamin E, which work more like scavengers to scarf up free radicals, has not worked in combating neurodegenerative disease, Thomas said. He's optimistic that directly targeting Nrf2 will be effective in at least slowing the disease, but there remains a need for clinically safe Nrf2 activators. Don't Miss: Altered circadian rhythm worsens Parkinson's disease, researchers showActivity of the Nrf2 pathway tends to slowly decline with age. Exercise upregulates Nrf2, and Morgan regularly encourages his patients to be as active as possible. A small group of patients with Parkinson's in Europe has a concentrated activation of Nrf2 that at least delays their disease onset. Parkinson's tends to be diagnosed in the mid-to-late 50s and early 60s and is more common in men. One concern with chronically elevating anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules with drugs like DMF and MMF is creating some of the same problems that immunosuppressive drugs given to organ transplant patients create. Chronic suppression of the immune response makes patients more susceptible to invaders like cancers and infections. The Parkinson's Disease Foundation estimates that there are seven to 10 million people worldwide living with Parkinson's. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Now, researchers at the University of Missouri (MU) School of Medicine have observed a variant of a stress-sensitive gene and exposure to stress during pregnancy among two groups of mothers of children with autism. The researchers believe the finding could be a step toward helping identify women who have greater risks for having children with autism when exposed to stressors during a specific time window during pregnancy. See Also: High-normal thyroid hormone level in pregnancy may affect fetal brain development ""Autism was thought to be largely a genetic disorder, but previous research has shown that environmental influences such as stress can play an important role in the development of the condition,"" said David Beversdorf, MD, associate professor in the departments of radiology, neurology and psychological sciences at the University of Missouri and the MU Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, and senior author of the study. ""We know that some mothers who experience significant levels of stress don't have children with autism, but others do. To help understand why, we studied a gene that is known to affect stress and found a link between it and the development of autism with exposure to stress."" Led by Beversdorf's graduate student, Patrick Hecht, PhD, in collaboration with Xudong Liu, PhD, with Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, the researchers studied two separate groups of mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder a group of families at MU and a group of families at Queen's University. The mothers were surveyed about stress during their pregnancy, such as loss of a job, moving or divorce. The mothers' blood was tested for a variation of the stress-sensitive gene known as 5-HTTLPR, which regulates the neurotransmitter serotonin in the nervous system. When a variation of the gene is present, the availability of serotonin is altered, causing an increased reaction to stress. In both groups, mothers of children with autism who have the variation of the stress-sensitive gene reported experiencing more stress during the end of the second and the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy, compared to mothers who did not carry the altered gene.

The independent Eppendorf Award Jury chaired by Prof. Reinhard Jahn selected Prof. Adrian Liston (Group leader at VIB Translational Immunology Lab, University of Leuven, Belgium) as the 2016 winner of the Eppendorf Award for Young European Investigators.  The Award ceremony took place at the EMBL Advanced Training Centre in Heidelberg, Germany, on June 2, 2016. The laudatio honoring Adrian Liston s achievements was held by the jury chairman Prof. Reinhard Jahn. Adrian Liston, born 1980, receives the   20,000 prize for his seminal work in elucidating key mechanisms by which the immune system avoids attacking its own organism while remaining effective against pathogens. His experiments have paved the way for understanding key steps in controlling regulatory T-cells that are critical for balancing between autoimmunity and immunosuppression. His work opens up the way for new therapeutic approaches towards diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune homeostasis. Adrian Liston:  My laboratory studies the genetic basis of immune disease through a multi-disciplinary approach that assesses the entire cascade of events leading to disease. We use genetic approaches to identify new mutations causing primary immunodeficiencies, cellular and biochemical immunology approaches to determine the impact of these mutations on the tolerance checkpoints, and disease modelling approaches to study the process of tissue destruction that leads to pathology.  Our mission is to identify the most sensitive intervention point in the disease pathway for the development of effective therapeutics.The 2016 Eppendorf Award is a great recognition of the work done by all of the amazing people in my team.  I see this prize as a validation of our philosophy to keep a broad perspective of immune diseases rather than focusing in on a single pathway or technique.  With the Eppendorf Young Investigator Award, which was established in 1995, Eppendorf AG honors outstanding work in biomedical research and supports young scientists in Europe up to the age of 35. The Eppendorf Award is presented in partnership with the scientific journal Nature.

Aprea s PiSARRO trial is investigating the safety and efficacy of APR-246 in combination with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Results presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) showed:  APR-246 can be combined with standard chemotherapy at relevant doses, allowing the highest of the tested doses to be selected as the dose for continuing the trial in a randomized Phase II trial. All 21 patients treated in the study that are evaluable according to RECIST criteria have stable disease or better. In addition, 15 out of 18 evaluable patients had a GCIG CA-125 (tumor antigen biomarker) response after 3 treatment cycles. Overall response rate (GCIG or RECIST) was 18/24 (75%). APR-246 showed linear pharmacokinetics with no accumulation and low intra patient variability and no indication of interaction between APR-246 and chemotherapy, supporting the combination of APR-246 with carboplatin and doxorubicin at relevant doses. The main related treatment-emergent Grade 3-4 adverse events have been neutropenia, anemia and vomiting. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events have been low-grade gastrointestinal (nausea/vomiting), central nervous system (dizziness) and hematological (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) events. The hematological side effects can be attributed to the chemotherapy, although a contribution from the addition of APR-246 cannot be ruled out at this time. No new safety concerns have emerged in the study. Prof. Charlie Gourley, Chair of Medical Oncology and Honorary Consultant in Medical Oncology at the University of Edinburgh, said of the results:  APR-246 is an extremely exciting new agent because it targets tumors with mutant forms of the p53 gene, which is the gene most frequently altered in human cancer. This study shows that APR-246 can be successfully combined with standard chemotherapy for ovarian cancer with minimal additional toxicity. The percentage of patients whose cancer responded to this treatment regime was encouraging and we look forward to validating these findings in a larger clinical trial.  Dr. Mikael von Euler, Chief Medical Officer of Aprea, said:  We are very pleased with the results of the Phase Ib trial and to be able to move this exciting drug forward into a randomized Phase II trial in the third quarter of this year. It is especially important that the patients who have more difficult-to-treat disease seem to get as much benefit as those with less aggressive disease. The current safety profile combined with the evidence of clinical activity suggests that APR-246 might become a very important drug for patients with ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the mechanism suggests that APR-246 might have relevance in other tumor types and we look forward to pursing those opportunities. ","Published: June 8, 2016"

For this work, Dr Giebel selected the ZetaView from Particle Metrix GmbH. A leading scientist in the study of EVs, Dr Giebel has published a number of papers where he has worked on the sizing of EV fractions including exosomes and microvesicles. He has compared different techniques including nanoparticle tracking analysis, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. There are positives and negatives for each of the techniques. For example, data may be skewed to either higher or lower values than the  real  size values. This may come from artefacts of the measuring method or from the effect of sample preparation. Dr Giebel has collaborated with Particle Metrix to improve and develop characterisation methods for EVs. This has included the development of a fluorescence mode. So, now for routine screening, Dr Giebel chooses the ZetaView in his laboratory. He particularly likes the measuring regime which takes eleven averaged measurements over a large field of view making his results more representative.  His publications in this field date from 2011 when writing with Sokolova1, he compared different nanoparticle measurement techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). With the advent of ZetaView, Dr Giebel reported all his NTA measurements based on the new machine in an applied publication  Extracellular Vesicles Improve Post-Stroke Neuroregeneration and Prevent Postischemic Immunosuppression2.  This is a good illustration of Dr Giebel's overall research goals which are to find new therapeutic approaches for nanoparticles. The 2016 review paper in ACS Nano3 further supports his belief. In a publication co-authored by scientists from 37 European institutes, recent research has demonstrated that all body fluids assessed contain substantial amounts of vesicles that range in size from 30 to 1000 nm and that are surrounded by phospholipid membranes containing different membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts and caveolae. The most prominent representatives of these so-called extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized exosomes (70 150 nm), which are derivatives of the endosomal system, and microvesicles (100 1000 nm), which are produced by outward budding of the plasma membrane.

They will use data gathered to track the spread of the virus and spot its emergence in large towns and cities. Working with the Instituto Evandro Chagas, in Bel m   part of the Brazilian Ministry of Health which is supporting the project, the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of S o Paulo and the Funda o Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), in Salvador, Bahia   over the 30-day sampling period, mobile testing teams will travel to north-eastern Brazil and test samples from 750 patients in coastal Brazil - from Bel m itself in the north to Salvador in the east. Led by the University of Birmingham, the project is supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and draws together experts from Public Health England, the Universities of Oxford, Nottingham and Edinburgh, as well as the University of Sydney, Australia and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, in Toronto, Canada.  Dr Nick Loman, from the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, said:  Zika is spreading across the Americas and the Pacific and geneticists are playing catch-up. There are very few publicly available DNA sequences and hardly any from the regions where cases of microcephaly are most prevalent.  Using the mobile laboratories, we can take to the roads of north-east Brazil to detect and characterise the early emergence of Zika in large urban centres. The data we gather will help to understand how the virus has spread across Brazil, Latin America, and make better predictions about how it might spread to other regions in the future. We are also able to bring cutting-edge genomic surveillance technology to public health laboratories previously unequipped with this capability.   The portable DNA sequencing systems allow us to do outbreak genome sequencing in real-time, impacting directly on the response to the virus on the ground, as well as helping to build a picture of its evolution.  I hope our work in Brazil will reveal more about Zika s origins, how often it has entered the Americas, how it interacts with the immune system, how many strains there are, and whether it interacts with other viruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya. We have no real feel for that at the moment. Even though the volume of knowledge is increasing, there is much remaining to be learnt about Zika virus.  He added that genome sequencing in outbreaks is useful to understand how the virus evolves, but the information had to be available quickly in order for this information to guide control efforts.  This method and technology has already shown to be useful in the surveillance of Ebola in Guinea during the 2014-2016 epidemic[i]. The team will adopt an open data policy on the project   making information collected freely available to researchers and public health analysts investigating the spread of the virus as it is generated. Interested parties can find information and data here http://zibraproject.github.io/. Experts at the World Health Organisation (WHO) believe the mosquito-borne virus can cause the birth defect microcephaly, which can result in abnormal smallness of the head - a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development. The virus is also associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome - a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis.  The WHO has also reported the first signs of a possible rise in microcephaly cases outside Brazil, which is the hardest-hit country so far in an outbreak spreading rapidly across Latin America and the Caribbean. The research team in Brazil will use a lightweight MinION DNA sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which weighs less than 100g and is powered by the USB of a laptop. The device is currently being used by more than 1,500 researchers worldwide. Following an initial training period, the genome surveillance laboratory will set out from Bel m, visiting Natal, Joao Pessoa, Recife and Salvador. The MinION equipment was first used successfully for remote disease surveillance by University of Birmingham-led teams in Conakry, Guinea, in April 2015 where Ebola samples from patients could be sequenced as soon as new cases were diagnosed. Information was available more quickly as samples could be analysed on site, in real time, rather than being shipped to traditional genome laboratories often located on a different continent. By sequencing 142 samples from Ebola patients in Guinea, they were able to provide very detailed information about how cases were related, providing important clues to World Health Organisation epidemiologists battling to halt transmission of the virus.","Published: June 8, 2016"

These studies will also incorporate extensive translational work including exploration of novel biomarkers to better differentiate responders from non-responders in lung cancer as well as preclinical studies of next generation immunotherapeutic agents that may be used to expand the benefits to larger numbers of patients. Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor currently approved in 50 countries globally for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, and Yervoy is a CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor approved in 50 countries globally for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The collaboration will leverage MD Anderson s existing immunotherapy platform, which helps to link immunologic data with the genomic and proteomic platforms across a range of cancer types, and broaden the scientific understanding of I-O via preclinical and clinical studies in lung cancer. Data generated will assist Bristol-Myers Squibb in optimizing I-O combinations for future clinical trials while also enhancing mechanistic understanding of immune system function in mounting of anti-tumor responses.  Immunotherapy agents, such as nivolumab, already have prolonged the lives of many patients with metastatic NSCLC. Through our multidisciplinary collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we look forward to exploring innovative ways to integrate immunotherapy with other treatments, including surgery and radiation, with the goal of improving standard of care and expanding treatment options for all patients, including those with early stage disease,  said John Heymach, M.D., Ph.D., chair of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology at MD Anderson. Heymach also is co-leader of MD Anderson s Lung Cancer Moon Shot, part of the institution s Moon Shots Program to reduce cancer deaths by accelerating the development of new therapies, prevention efforts and early detection from scientific discoveries.  Strategic collaborations with academia have been central to helping Bristol-Myers Squibb develop and deliver new immuno-oncology treatment options to patients,  said Jean Viallet, M.D., Global Clinical Research Lead, Oncology, Bristol-Myers Squibb.  This collaboration will leverage the considerable experience of MD Anderson to accelerate and expand our scientific and clinical understanding of how the immune system and other treatments might work together to fight cancer.  MD Anderson s immunotherapy platform, also part of the Moon Shots Program, conducts immune monitoring of tumors and blood before, during and after treatment to better understand how and when immunotherapy works.  Having approved PD-1 inhibitors for metastatic NSCLC gives us the chance to explore what it is about the tumor microenvironment that allows response to these agents,  said Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., immunotherapy platform scientific director and professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology at MD Anderson.  Immune monitoring can generate data that will improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to response or resistance to treatment and facilitate the development of new biomarkers to personalize treatments and match patients to the right therapies or combinations.  I-O is an innovative approach to cancer research and treatment that is designed to harness the body s own immune system to fight cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, resulting in more than 1.5 million deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization. In September of 2014, Bristol-Myers Squibb and MD Anderson entered into an I-O clinical collaboration that is focused on the evaluation of Bristol-Myers Squibb I-O assets for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as acute and chronic leukemia.

A research team led by a scientist at the Department of Energy s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and at UC Berkeley has found that copper plays a key role in metabolizing fat. Long prized as a malleable, conductive metal used in cookware, electronics, jewelry and plumbing, copper has been gaining increasing attention over the past decade for its role in certain biological functions. It has been known that copper is needed to form red blood cells, absorb iron, develop connective tissue and support the immune system. The new findings, to appear in the July print issue of Nature Chemical Biology but published online today, establishes for the first time copper s role in fat metabolism. The team of researchers was led by Chris Chang, a faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab s Chemical Sciences Division, a UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Co-lead authors of the study are Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Joseph Cotruvo Jr, both UC Berkeley postdoctoral researchers in chemistry with affiliations at Berkeley Lab.  We find that copper is essential for breaking down fat cells so that they can be used for energy,  said Chang.  It acts as a regulator. The more copper there is, the more the fat is broken down. We think it would be worthwhile to study whether a deficiency in this nutrient could be linked to obesity and obesity-related diseases.  Dietary copper Chang said that copper could potentially play a role in restoring a natural way to burn fat. The nutrient is plentiful in foods such as oysters and other shellfish, leafy greens, mushrooms, seeds, nuts and beans. According to the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, an adult s estimated average dietary requirement for copper is about 700 micrograms per day.  Copper is not something the body can make, so we need to get it through our diet,  said Chang.  The typical American diet, however, doesn t include many green leafy vegetables. Asian diets, for example, have more foods rich in copper.  But Chang cautions against ingesting copper supplements as a result of these study results. Too much copper can lead to imbalances with other essential minerals, including zinc. Copper as a  brake on a brake  The researchers made the copper-fat link using mice with a genetic mutation that causes the accumulation of copper in the liver. Notably, these mice have larger than average deposits of fat compared with normal mice. The inherited condition, known as Wilson s disease, also occurs in humans and is potentially fatal if left untreated. Analysis of the mice with Wilson s disease revealed that the abnormal buildup of copper was accompanied by lower than normal lipid levels in the liver compared with control groups of mice. The researchers also found that the white adipose tissue, or white fat, of the mice with Wilson s disease had lower levels of copper compared with the control mice and correspondingly higher levels of fat deposits. They then treated the Wilson s disease mice with isoproterenol, a beta agonist known to induce lipolysis, the breakdown of fat into fatty acids, through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. They noted that the mice with Wilson s disease exhibited less fat-breakdown activity compared with control mice. The results prompted the researchers to conduct cell culture analyses to clarify the mechanism by which copper influences lipolysis. The researchers used inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) equipment at Berkeley Lab to measure levels of copper in fat tissue. They found that copper binds to phosphodiesterase 3, or PDE3, an enzyme that binds to cAMP, halting cAMP s ability to facilitate the breakdown of fat.  When copper binds phosphodiesterase, it s like a brake on a brake,  said Chang.  That s why copper has a positive correlation with lipolysis.  Hints from cows and copper The connection between copper and fat metabolism is not altogether surprising. The researchers actually found hints of the link in the field of animal husbandry.  It had been noted in cattle that levels of copper in the feed would affect how fatty the meat was,  said Chang.  This effect on fat deposits in animals was in the agricultural literature, but it hadn t been clear what the biochemical mechanisms were linking copper and fat.  The new work builds upon prior research from Chang s lab on the roles of copper and other metals in neuroscience. In support of President Barack Obama s BRAIN Initiative, Berkeley Lab provided Chang seed funding in 2013 through the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program. Chang s work continued through the BRAIN Tri-Institutional Partnership, an alliance with Berkeley Lab, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. Of the copper in human bodies, there are particularly high concentrations found in the brain. Recent studies, including those led by Chang, have found that copper helps brain cells communicate with each other by acting as a brake when it is time for neural signals to stop. While Chang s initial focus was on the role of copper in neural communications, he branched out to investigations of metals in fat metabolism and other biological pathways. This latest work was primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health.","Published: June 8, 2016"

The findings, published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, propose a role for calcium-channel blockers such as fendiline hydrochloride as potential inhibitors to the survival of Cryptococcus neoformans, the pathogen which causes cryptococcosis, and represent a promising strategy for future anticryptococcal drug design and therapy. Professor Robin May, from the University of Birmingham, explained,  Fungi are intrinsically more difficult to target than bacteria, because they are much more closely related, evolutionarily, to humans. Finding an essential pathway in a fungus that you could inhibit, which doesn t exist in humans, is very difficult. Therefore the approach of stimulating your own immune system to kill the fungus, instead of killing it directly through treatment, is potentially more powerful.  In order to cause disease, Cryptococcus neoformans hides inside the patient s own white blood cells, making it particularly difficult to treat. In the Birmingham Drug Discovery facility, the team screened 1,200 off-patent, FDA-approved, drugs to identify candidates that might be redeployed to fight cryptococcosis by triggering the white blood cells to recognise that they are infected and to kill the fungus hiding inside them. After initial screening, 19 of those compounds in the Prestwick Chemical Library  of FDA-approved small molecules showed promise for significantly reducing intracellular growth of the pathogen. Secondary screening and host cell toxicity assays ruled out many of these molecules, but highlighted fendiline hydrochloride, more commonly used in the treatment of angina and chest pain, as a potential candidate for the development of future anticryptococcal therapies. Professor May said,  Although calcium channel blockers have not previously been identified as a potential anticryptococcal agent, their ability to work in this way makes sense. We have previously shown that Cryptococcus perturbs calcium signalling when living inside human cells, probably in order to trick the cell into not killing it. Consequently, it s possible that fendiline hydrochloride works by overcoming this perturbation and restoring normal calcium dynamics, helping the host to kill the fungus. Cryptococcosis neoformans poses a major threat to immunocompromised patients and is a leading killer of HIV patients worldwide. HIV/AIDS patients are particularly prone to cryptococcal infections, with an estimated overwhelming disease burden of about one million cases of cryptococcal meningitis per year. The highest incidence of cryptococcal meningitis related deaths in HIV-positive patients occurs in sub-Saharan Africa with an associated mortality of 70%. The infection process begins with inhalation of infectious agents (spores or dessicated yeasts) resulting in a primary pulmonary infection, which can further disseminate to the central nervous system causing meningitis. Cryptococci are particularly difficult to treat with antifungal agents due to their ability to manipulate and exist within the host s immune response. Dr Rebecca Hall, also from the University of Birmingham, added,  Considering the poor status of current anticryptococcal drugs, new treatment options for cryptococcosis are much needed.   Though the relatively high dose of fendiline hydrochloride required renders it unfit for clinical deployment against cryptococcosis in itself, our study presents an opportunity to approach treatment of this much neglected disease in a new way.  The team note that further research is required to identify if other compounds that target calcium dynamics could be used in the fight against a much neglected disease.","Published: June 8, 2016"

Rice bioengineer Jeffrey Hartgerink and his students made a hydrogel of what they call  missing tooth  peptide nanofibers. Gaps in the fibers are designed to hold drug molecules that have hydrophobic   water-avoiding   properties. The biodegradable gel can be injected where needed and releases the medication over time. Hydrogels built of custom peptides are a specialty of Hartgerink s lab, which has introduced variations in recent years for tissue growth and healing through the clotting powers of synthetic snake venom. The new work by Hartgerink and Rice graduate students I-Che Li and Amanda Moore aims to administer drugs that tend to clump, which makes them difficult to deliver via the bloodstream.  Hydrophilic (water-attracting) molecules frequently don t need a delivery mechanism because you can inject them,  Hartgerink said.  They re water-soluble, they go into the blood and they re fine. But hydrophobic drugs are challenging to deliver. We load them into the interstices of these fibers, and they can be delivered wherever we inject the hydrogel. In the lab s earlier hydrogels, proteins or small molecules are trapped in the gel created by the microscopic fibers.  Here, we ve done something different: We modify the inside of the fibers,  he said.  We remove part of the internal portion of the fiber   that s the missing tooth   and that s a hydrophobic environment.  To make the unique fibers, the lab first made custom peptides with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids and left intentional gaps. Hydrophobic small-molecule drugs mixed with the peptides were attracted to the gaps and trapped when the peptides self-assembled into jaw-like fibers.The hydrogel becomes a liquid due to the shearing forces encountered as it passes through a needle, a phenomenon called thixotropy, and it returns to gel form in the body. The drugs nest in their peptide pockets until released by the hydrogel. The lab has tested hydrogels with cancer, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs and is studying how the drugs are released over time. Hartgerink said the  missing tooth  hydrogel can serve more than one function.  We can simultaneously trap hydrophilic proteins in the hydrogel matrix,  he said.  There s no reason we can t do both at the same time. This paper just looks at one aspect, but they re not mutually exclusive approaches. The long-term goal of this material is that it eventually can do everything. ","Published: June 8, 2016"

They report on their invention in a new paper published online in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics. choi_origamiChoi previously developed a paper-based origami battery. The first design, shaped like a matchbook, stacked four modules together. The ninja star version, which measures about 2.5 inches wide, boasts increased power and voltage, with eight small batteries connected in series.  Last time, it was a proof of concept. The power density was in the nanowatt range,  says Choi, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.  This time, we increased it to the microwatt range. We can light an LED for about 20 minutes or power other types of biosensors.  Paper-based biosensors include pregnancy tests and HIV tests. The sensitivity of such tests is limited, Choi says, and a battery like his could allow the use of more sophisticated fluorescent or electrochemical biosensors in developing countries.  Commercially available batteries are too wasteful and expensive for the field,  he says.  Ultimately, I d like to develop instant, disposable, accessible bio-batteries for use in resource-limited regions.  The new design folds into a star with one inlet at its center and the electrical contacts at the points of each side. After a few drops of dirty water are placed into the inlet, the device can be opened into a Frisbee-like ring to allow each of the eight fuel cells to work. Each module is a sandwich of five functional layers with its own anode, proton exchange membrane and air-cathode. Choi s original matchbook-sized battery could be produced for about 5 cents. The new ninja star device is more expensive   roughly 70 cents   in part because it uses not only filter paper but also carbon cloth for the anode as well as copper tape. The team s next goal is to produce a fully paper-based device that has the power density of the new design and a lower price tag. Choi prides himself on involving students in his research, and this paper represents a special triumph for co-author Landen Kwan, who worked on the project during a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Binghamton in the summer of 2015. Kwan, then a student at Queensborough Community College, is now enrolled at Stony Brook University.

The largely Southern California-based study was designed to evaluate biomarkers for autism. Women were eligible for participation if they delivered their infants between July 2000 and September 2003.

The study which has been published in The Journal of Cell Biology, suggests potential new strategies to stimulate the regrowth of human neurons damaged by injury or disease. See Also: Getting rid of old mitochondria: Some neurons turn to neighbors to help take out the trash Neurons need large amounts of energy to extend their axons long distances through the body. This energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is provided by mitochondria, the cell's internal power plants. During development, mitochondria are transported up and down growing axons to generate ATP wherever it is needed. In adults, however, mitochondria become less mobile as mature neurons produce a protein called syntaphilin that anchors the mitochondria in place. Zu-Hang Sheng and colleagues at the NINDS wondered whether this decrease in mitochondrial transport might explain why adult neurons are typically unable to regrow after injury. Sheng and his research fellow Bing Zhou, the first author of the study, initially found that when mature mouse axons are severed, nearby mitochondria are damaged and become unable to provide sufficient ATP to support injured nerve regeneration. However, when the researchers genetically removed syntaphilin from the nerve cells, mitochondrial transport was enhanced, allowing the damaged mitochondria to be replaced by healthy mitochondria capable of producing ATP. Syntaphilin-deficient mature neurons therefore regained the ability to regrow after injury, just like young neurons, and removing syntaphilin from adult mice facilitated the regeneration of their sciatic nerves after injury.

The toxins, which researchers isolated from the venom of Heteroscodra maculata, a hand-sized West African tarantula commonly referred to as the ""ornamental baboon"" or ""Togo starburst"" tarantula, could be a powerful tool for developing new drugs to treat chronic pain and potentially epilepsy, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. The study was led by researchers in the lab of David Julius, PhD, Chair of the Department of Physiology at the University of California (UC), San Francisco, and is in the journal Nature. See Also: Staring pain in the face   Software  reads  kids  expressions to measure pain levels The researchers are excited about this finding for two equally important reasons: The newly discovered toxins cause pain by specifically triggering a type of sodium channel within a rare class of pain nerve called A-delta fibers, a discovery with the potential to open a new chapter in our understanding of pain, the researchers say. But these toxins also represent a broadly applicable tool for selectively manipulating this type of sodium channel, which is found throughout the nervous system and has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders unrelated to pain. ""It's a good problem to have,"" said Jeremiah Osteen, PhD, the postdoctoral fellow in Julius's group who led the research team. ""We didn't know which of the two findings we should be more excited about."" Julius's lab which is renowned for the discovery and characterization of the so-called ""wasabi receptor"" has recently been working to identify new pain pathways by screening more than a hundred different venoms from poisonous spiders, scorpions, and centipedes sourced from the collection of co-author Glenn F. King, PhD, of the University of Queensland in Australia all of which have evolved chemical defenses that target the biology of animals' pain nerves. ""There are dozens to hundreds of different active peptides in each animal's venom,"" Julius said. ""The deeper you look the more toxins there seem to be."" The Togo starburst tarantula's venom struck them as being particularly interesting because it appeared to activate a particular type of sodium channel within sensory nerves that was not a part of known pain pathways. Learn More:  Pain sensing  gene discovery could help in development of new methods of pain relief To identify which of the dozens of chemicals that made up the tarantula's venom were specifically targeting these channels, the researchers separated the venom and applied the components one-by-one to rodent sensory neurons in a lab dish. They found two peptide molecules that specifically and powerfully activated these sensory nerves, and experiments with lab-synthesized versions of the same molecules confirmed that these chemicals could activate pain-sensing neurons on their own. Experiments with an array of different drugs that block candidate receptor molecules demonstrated that the two toxins specifically bind to and demonstrated that this particular receptor is indeed found on A-delta nerves in mice. The accepted notion is that A-delta fibers may convey the sharp, immediate shock of a burn or a cut, ahead of the burning throb conveyed by slower C fibers. The newly discovered tarantula peptides allowed the researchers to isolate A-delta fibers in mice, and show that they also appear to play a role in touch hypersensitivity when normally innocuous light touch causes discomfort a type of pain common to diseases like shingles and many chronic pain syndromes. Additional experiments also implicated heightened touch sensitivity of Nav1.1-expressing nerves in a mouse model of irritable bowel syndrome, suggesting these nerves, and this channel, may play a role in the chronic discomfort such patients experience. The pharmacological aspect of the research is also exciting for researchers because the nine subtly different voltage-sensitive sodium channels that are critical for nervous system function are extremely hard to manipulate individually. Researchers have been on a decades-long quest to find selective drugs for each subtype, so identifying two in one spider is a valuable find. ""These channels are incredibly hard to identify drugs for because the different subtypes are closely related, making it difficult to identify drugs or other agents that act on one subtype and not another,"" Julius said. ""These toxins provide unique tools to start understanding exactly what this particular subtype, Nav1.1, does in terms of pain sensation.""3 Don't Miss: New technologies can help short circuit chronic pain The Nav1.1 subtype in particular has been implicated in the development of diseases including epilepsy, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, and the researchers hope that in addition to helping scientists understand the biology of pain, the new discovery will lead to the development of new drugs to target these diseases. ""These spiders had millions of years of evolution to come up with these potent and specific toxins,"" Osteen said. ""They're tools one might be hard pressed to design as well in the lab.""

""The first time I ever heard of the enteric nervous system was two years ago, and I was like 'What's that?'"" said Xiling Shen, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University and author of the study that appears in Nature Communications. ""Even with neurobiologists, their only exposure to it is typically something like a half-page in a textbook. But it's actually very important."" See Also: Gut Feelings - Sensory neurons detect fullness and nutrients in the GI tract in surprising ways Consisting of five times more neurons than the spinal cord and often termed as a ""second brain,"" the enteric nervous system is a mesh-like sheath of neurons that controls the gastrointestinal tract. It regulates how food moves through the digestive system and communicates potential problems to the immune system. And while it has a direct line to both the brain and spinal cord, the enteric system has the ability to direct the organs under its control independent of either system. Despite its importance, however, very little is known about the enteric nervous system, such as how it responds to medications or what can go wrong with it to cause disease. ""About one-quarter of the world's population is affected by a functional gastrointestinal disorder,"" Shen said. ""You've probably heard of the term functional GI disorder, which encompasses diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, constipation and incontinence. If you look at the physiology in these diseases, the gut looks fine. It's the nerves that are somehow malfunctioning. And the reason the term includes so many diseases is because we really don't have any idea what's going on with those nerves."" Shen is looking to change that by literally installing an observation window. In the new study, Shen implanted a transparent window made of tough borosilicate glass into the skin over the stomachs of mice. With no skull or bone structures to anchor the window, he needed to devise a 3D-printed surgical insert for stabilization. The device prevents the intestines from moving too much while maintaining normal digestive functions, allowing researchers to look at the same spot over multiple days. Being the first to get a live look at the enteric nervous system, Shen was not about to waste the view. Because the gut can be a busy, noisy environment, he devised a system to record both electrical and optical activity at the same time also a first for the field. The experiment uses transgenic mice with nerves that light up with a green hue when firing. By using a transparent graphene sensor to obtain electrical signals from the nerves, Shen gained an unobstructed view of the neural activity. Learn More: GI tract bacteria help decrease stroke The optical signal gives spatial resolution, allowing researchers to tell which neuron is firing. The electrical signal provides time resolution, which pins down the exact waveform of the firing neurons. Shen said the enteric nervous system is now ready to be explored. ""So much is known about the brain and spinal cord because we can open them up, look at them, record the neural activities and map their behaviors,"" said Shen. ""Now we can start doing the same for the gut. We can see how it reacts to different drugs, neurotransmitters or diseases. We have even artificially activated individual neurons in the gut with light, which nobody has ever done before. This innovation will help us understand this 'dark' nervous system that we currently have completely no idea about."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

However, HIV is so mutable that it has so far effectively evaded both the human immune system and scientists  attempts to make an effective vaccine to protect against it. Now, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have figured out how to make a much-improved research tool that they hope will open the door to new and better HIV vaccine designs. George M. Shaw, MD, PhD, a professor of Hematology/Oncology and Microbiology, and Hui Li, MD, a research assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology, published their results in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. An ideal preventive vaccine works by presenting non-infectious components or a weakened form of a microbe to the host s immune cells to prime the system for future contact with the invader. This allows the immune system to mount an attack against a microbe it has already seen.   But in the case of fighting AIDS, HIV s ability to rapidly mutate, especially its outer coat protein -- the envelope -- poses a special challenge to vaccine development. So too does the fact that the envelope is coated with host derived sugars that the human immune system cannot recognize as foreign. These and other features of HIV have stymied vaccine development for over 30 years. Despite these obstacles, substantial progress in HIV vaccine development has been made, and a number of promising candidate vaccines are in development. However, still another hurdle to progress has been the absence of a good animal model in which to test HIV vaccines. The immune systems of small animals like mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs are too different from the human immune system to be helpful. Rhesus monkeys are primates whose immune system is much closer to that of humans, but HIV cannot infect or replicate in monkeys. To overcome this obstacle, researchers developed chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs), genetically engineered viruses containing the envelope of HIV but with other viral components from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which naturally infects monkeys. SHIVs thus seemed to have the best of both worlds: They carried the envelope of HIV and they replicated in monkeys, causing AIDS-like disease. But there was still one catch -- one unforeseen problem with SHIVs. The only HIV envelopes that would allow SHIVs to infect rhesus monkeys were those that were adapted in artificial ways to bind to the rhesus CD4 molecule, the primary receptor for HIV. As a byproduct of this adaptation, the SHIVs lost their natural defenses to antibodies. This rendered the SHIVs of little value to HIV vaccine research. Now, Shaw, Li, and their colleagues have found a way to overcome these obstacles and to make a much better SHIV   one that closely mimics HIV infection in humans.    We found that changing a single amino acid in the envelope coat protein of naturally occurring HIV strains led to dramatic differences in the ability of SHIVs to infect monkeys, while at the same time retaining the native-like features of the virus envelope and its interaction with the human immune system,  Shaw said.   This is an enabling discovery for the HIV vaccine field because it allows scientists for the first time to study in a controlled and reproducible manner the interaction of natural HIV envelope proteins with monkey B lymphocytes, which are stimulated to make protective antibodies,  Li said. The Envelope is Key Many viruses, including flu and HIV, are covered by a protective membrane called an envelope. Embedded in this envelope are viral and host proteins and sugars. The viral envelope fuses with the host cell, allowing the viral genes to enter the host cell and replicate. The HIV outer envelope is covered by host sugar molecules, making it hard for the host immune system to recognize the virus as foreign. For a vaccine to target the virus, it must elicit antibodies that get past this sugar shield and bind to viral specific proteins. This is where the new SHIVs come in   they express an envelope that closely mimics ones found on naturally occurring HIV strains. As such, the new SHIVs can be used as a test system to elicit protective antibodies in monkeys and as challenge viruses to determine if vaccine elicited antibodies are protective against HIV infection. In the PNAS study, Li and Shaw hypothesized that changing the binding affinity of the HIV envelope to rhesus monkey CD4, the primary receptor for HIV, would be the key to successful SHIV design. However, this strategy must be done without altering the natural protective features of the envelope. To test this hypothesis they examined the evolutionary history of all types of HIV-related immunodeficiency viruses that naturally infect humans and subhuman primates to look for amino acids under strong positive selection pressure as viruses spread from one primate species to another. They zeroed in on one amino acid out of about 850 that comprise the viral envelope. This amino acid, called  Env375,  turned out to be the key.  Changing this one amino acid in HIV to resemble variants found in SIV enhanced the entry of SHIVs into monkey CD4 T cells by a thousand-fold,  Li said.  It was like night and day.  Moving quickly forward on the heels of this discovery, Li and Shaw have created a set of  designer SHIVs  that contain HIV envelopes of particular research interest. These HIV envelopes in the context of human infection have elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies, the ultimate goal of HIV vaccine research. The team infected rhesus macaques with the  designer SHIVs  and closely monitored them for the development of neutralizing antibodies. They have already observed in numerous infected animals that the SHIV virus and host antibody response are evolving in ways that closely resemble human infection by HIV-1.  These results have given us hope that the new SHIVs will indeed be a game-changer for HIV vaccine research,  Shaw said. The SHIVs replicated persistently at concentrations comparable to HIV-1 levels in humans and elicited neutralizing antibody responses typical of HIV-1.  We identified rhesus macaque CD4 binding as a critical determinant for productive SHIV infection in the monkeys and Env375 mutations that influence this,  Shaw said.  This discovery represents a novel and generalizable strategy for constructing SHIVs with envelope glycoproteins of particular interest, including those that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies in humans or ones that bind particular B cell receptors.  The group s next steps include evaluating the molecular pathways by which the HIV envelope and the corresponding neutralizing antibodies co-evolve in humans and in rhesus macaques, leading to the development of protective broadly neutralizing antibodies. By using this approach, Li and Shaw hope to use SHIV infections of rhesus macaques as a guide to successful vaccine development for HIV in humans.","Published: June 7, 2016"

They also demonstrated that the gene is responsible for producing a protein involved in packaging the neurotransmitter dopamine in neurons. Loss of dopamine-producing neurons is a defining characteristic of Parkinson s disease. Taken together, the study s findings provide new clues to explain how Parkinson s disease develops in the brain. Those clues may inform future therapies for the disorder, which currently has no cure and few known causes.  Previous research has associated Parkinson s disease with various factors in the environment, but the only direct causes that are known are genetic,  said principal investigator Teepu Siddique, MD, the Les Turner ALS Foundation/Herbert C. Wenske Foundation Professor of Neurology and of Cell and Molecular Biology.  Many genes have been claimed to cause Parkinson s disease, but they haven t been validated. We show that mutations in this new gene lead to pathologically and clinically proven cases of the disease.  About 15 percent of Parkinson s disease cases are thought to be caused by genetics, such as mutations in two genes called SNCA and LRRK2. Siddique said that other genes have only been associated with features of parkinsonism, a general term for neurological disorders with motor symptoms. The Northwestern Medicine team s proof that mutations in TMEM230 lead to Parkinson s disease is the result of 20 years of research conducted with collaborators around the world. How they uncovered the gene The project began in 1996, when Siddique and study first author Han-Xiang Deng, MD, PhD, research professor of Neurology, began investigating a family with 15 members who had typical symptoms of Parkinson s disease. Using DNA samples provided by co-author Ali Rajput, MBBS, from the University of Saskatchewan, Siddique and Deng performed genome-wide analysis on 65 of the family s members, including 13 with the disease, in hopes of finding a common mutation that could explain the prevalence. They were able to narrow the search down to a small region of DNA on chromosome 20 that contained 141 known genes. Using whole exome sequencing technology, they then compared DNA variations   genetic differences   in one healthy family member to those in four family members with the disease. The scientists found more than 90,000 variants before eventually identifying TMEM230 as the gene with disease-causing mutation.  This was a totally new gene. We didn t know its function,  Deng explained.  So we did a series of studies to find out where the protein encoded by this gene is located and what it does.  The scientists discovered that TMEM230 encodes a protein that extends across the membrane of tiny sacks inside neurons called synaptic vesicles, which store neurotransmitters before they re released from one cell to another.  Current symptomatic treatments for Parkinson s disease increase the neurotransmitter dopamine that is released by these synaptic vesicles to cells that project into different parts of the brain controlling motor activity, mood and many other organ systems affected by the disease,  Siddique said. The scientists hypothesize that the protein is involved in the movement of these vesicles.  We believe that vesicle trafficking defects are a key mechanism of Parkinson s disease, not just for cases with this mutation, but a common pathway for the majority of cases. All three of the authenticated genes are concentrated on synaptic vesicles,  Deng said.  Our new findings suggest that normalizing synaptic vesicle trafficking may be a strategy for future therapeutic development. We can develop drugs to promote this critical pathway.  Verifying the gene across populations Importantly, the research team also found mutations in the TMEM230 gene in cases of Parkinson s disease in additional families in North America and as far away as China. They verified that these patients had both clinical characteristics of the disease (symptoms like tremors, slow movement and stiffness) as well as pathological evidence in the brain (loss of dopamine neurons and abnormal accumulations of proteins inside surviving neurons).  This particular gene causing Parkinson s disease is not just limited to one population in North America,  Siddique said.  It s worldwide, found in very different ethnic and environmental conditions. These mutations are that strong.  In future research, Siddique and Deng plan to explore how TMEM230 mutations cause disease using mouse models.","Published: June 7, 2016"

The collaboration aims to evaluate a platform for the safe and rapid production of AAV vectors, using Touchlight s next generation dbDNA  constructs, in conjunction with Cobra s CDMO capabilities. The collaborative project is being led by Cobra and is partially funded by Innovate UK who has awarded  320K as part of their ongoing support for regenerative medicine and cell therapy development.  AAV vectors are the current delivery vehicle of choice for a large number of gene therapy treatments, due to their safety and efficacy. However, the advancement of these therapies into clinical trials is currently hampered by the time and expense required to manufacture the DNA constructs used to generate the viral vectors. This collaboration will use a combination of Cobra and Touchlight s strengths in order to evaluate a novel platform for the production of AAV vectors. Cobra will bring process development, GMP bioprocessing and quality assurance experience for plasmid DNA and viral vectors coupled with its significant operational knowledge of large scale manufacturing processes. Touchlight will supply novel dbDNA constructs made using their proprietary enzymatic manufacturing process technology for the production of the AAV vectors. Touchlight s technology is capable of generating large quantities of DNA and has the major advantage of being suitable for use with larger DNA inserts and gene sequences that are unstable in plasmid based systems.  Streamlining the manufacturing of AAV vectors will enable the acceleration of more products into clinical testing, which in turn will increase the likelihood of AAV vector delivered treatments being developed for a wide range of currently intractable diseases. Peter Coleman, CEO Cobra Biologics commented:  For over 15 years Cobra has been helping customers to manufacture their plasmid DNA and viral based medicines for gene therapy and regenerative medicine. In a rapidly growing sector pressure to save time and money in manufacturing is even more acute and the collaboration between Cobra and Touchlight will help to address expectations of the gene therapy and regenerative medicine community, their investors and patients.  Jonny Ohlson, CEO of Touchlight said:  Touchlight has developed a versatile and scalable technology for manufacturing DNA to meet the demands of the ever expanding landscape of DNA enabled industries. As a part of our ongoing development, we are looking to further the use of our platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Cobra has a great deal of experience in the manufacture of viral vectors and has credibility in the industry, and this collaboration will provide an opportunity to further evidence the utility of dbDNA and advance AAV vector manufacturing processes.  The project is Cobra s second to be awarded as part of Innovate UK 2015 funding for the development of regenerative medicines and cell therapies. In total  8 million has been invested into five collaborative R&D projects that address critical challenges faced by UK companies developing clinical treatments and commercial products in these areas.

The new Finished Dosage Formulation (FDF) event will be the first global pharma platform dedicated to the manufacture, development and supply of finished dosage forms. Chief amongst the trends reported was the increased need for different segments of the supply chain to work together in the creation of new  patented drugs or value-added generics.    Outsourcing for delivery systems is another key trend, as is partnering with more established companies in specific segments. For instance, if you only have a single oncology product, partnering and out-licensing with someone who has a wider dossier is a very good strategy.  Alan Sheppard, Principal, Global Generics and Biosimilarsat IMS Health. Licensing and partnerships are integral to growth because they allow market entry with lower risks, and capitalise on local knowledge to speed-up regulatory approvals and pricing processes. The key technology challenge for both generic and patented formulations is access to new technologies   spray drying, micronisation, hot melt extrusion and nano formulations   which enable the creation of more advanced, bioavailable and patient friendly combinations. As the majority of simple formulations have already been created, generic companies must develop innovative delivery mechanisms to add value to the original patented formulation and remain competitive.  Companies producing finished formulations need to partner and outsource more to get the correct mix of technologies and this is where we saw a huge opportunity for CPhI to introduce a finished dosage event. What we are attempting to do is bring Big Pharma and CMOs, to out-licensing and dossier specialists, end product distributors, and generic pharma companies to one location so that our clients can find new partners.  Cara Turner, Event Manager for Finished Dosage Formulation. Citing IMS figures, Alan Sheppard reported that, in the last 4-years, the USA (58%) and Europe (17%) have dominated growth in new speciality medicines   with the largest profit opportunities in smaller patient cohorts and speciality drugs, where there are still unmet patient needs. However, in generic formulations, although the US still represents 28% of growth, the pharmerging markets are really the driving force underlying this with 58% of growth. Significantly, and perhaps due to patient concerns in these regions, branded generics in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, are strongly preferred   whereas in the developed economies in-prescribing is most common. Generic companies and CMOs are now reimagining what is possible   as access to new technologies opens up more opportunities for innovative development. But collaborations are even stretching to excipient technologies says Jim Miller, president of PharmSource, as they help  facilitate matrix and multi-particulate formulations   allowing increased bioavailability, all of which has put new demands on the performance of excipients.  Sheppard added,  one company cannot offer full development capabilities, we need outsourcing to increase knowledge, whether in terms of local market entry, manufacturing, development or distribution   partnerships are clearly going to increase . The analysts concluded that Indian generic producers can anticipate sustained period of growth. For larger manufacturers, supply into global markets will continue   including the resurgent USA market   but small and medium sized enterprises should concentrate on domestic growth. Two major possible market challenges are the impending costs of GDUFA ii in the United States   particularly for CMOs with limited generics production. And, for generic companies, a longer-term question will be  how to get a fair reward for incremental formulation developments,  added Paul Fleming, Technical Director of the British Generic Manufacturers Association. Rutger Oudejans, Brand Director - Pharma at UBM EMEA, closed by saying:  We envisage this sector of CPhI Worldwide to drive considerable growth and importantly, attract a new delegate profile to the event. There are clear opportunities for diagnostic providers, licensors, delivery platforms and distributors, in addition to our current visitor base who will have access to a wider range of partners.

An initiative of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the GDC will be a core component of the National Cancer Moonshot and the President's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), and benefits from $70 million allocated to NCI to lead efforts in cancer genomics as part of PMI for Oncology. The GDC will centralize, standardize and make accessible data from large-scale NCI programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and its pediatric equivalent, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. Together, TCGA and TARGET represent some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomics datasets in the world, comprising more than two petabytes of data (one petabyte is equivalent to 223,000 DVDs filled to capacity with data). In addition, the GDC will accept submissions of cancer genomic and clinical data from researchers around the world who wish to share their data broadly. In so doing, researchers will be able to use the analytic methods of the GDC, allowing them to compare their findings with other data in the GDC. Data in the GDC, representing thousands of cancer patients and tumors, will be harmonized using standardized software algorithms so that they are accessible and broadly useful to any cancer researcher. The storage of raw genomic data in the GDC will also allow it to be reanalyzed as computational methods and genome annotations improve. It is important to note that, in this era of heightened concern about data security and authorized access, the GDC has important safeguards to ensure secure data storage and downloading. ""With the GDC, NCI has made a major commitment to maintaining long-term storage of cancer genomic data and providing researchers with free access to these data,"" said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. ""Importantly, the explanatory power of data in the GDC will grow over time as data from more patients are included, and ultimately the GDC will accelerate our efforts in precision medicine."" The GDC is being built and managed by the University of Chicago Center for Data Intensive Science, in collaboration with the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, all under an NCI contract with Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, Maryland. ""Of particular significance, the GDC will also house data from a number of newer NCI programs that will sequence the DNA of patients enrolled in NCI clinical trials,"" said Louis M. Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., NCI. ""These datasets will lead to a much deeper understanding of which therapies are most effective for individual cancer patients. With each new addition, the GDC will evolve into a smarter, more comprehensive knowledge system that will foster important discoveries in cancer research and increase the success of cancer treatment for patients."" The hope is that the GDC will form the basis for a comprehensive knowledge system for cancer. GDC researchers will be able to integrate genetic and clinical data, such as cancer imaging and histological data, with information on the molecular profiles of tumors as well as treatment response. From this perspective, the GDC would become an important resource for generating potentially actionable and life-changing information that ultimately could be used by doctors and their patients. The National Cancer Institute leads the National Cancer Program and the NIH's efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers.","Published: June 7, 2016"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/human-protein-found-to-block-zika-infection-197377,Human Protein Found to Block Zika Infection Research shows that the human protein IFITM  blocks Zika virus replication and prevents cell death  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Eight weeks after receiving their first samples of Zika virus, scientists at UMass Medical School have shown that a very small protein we all have in our bodies interferon-induced protein 3 (IFITM3) can dramatically reduce the ability of Zika virus to infect human and mouse cells. In some cases, IFITM3 can also prevent Zika virus from killing our cells. The findings, by senior author Abraham Brass, MD, PhD, assistant professor of microbiology & physiological systems, suggest that boosting the actions of IFITM3 may be useful for inhibiting Zika virus and other emerging viral infections.   This work represents the first look at how our cells defend themselves against Zika virus  attack,  said Dr. Brass.  Our results show that Zika virus has a weakness that we could potentially exploit to prevent or stop infection.  Previous studies by Brass and Paul Kellam, PhD, a professor at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the UK, have shown that people who have a genetic variant, or allele, of the IFITM3 gene are more susceptible to the development of severe influenza. While relatively rare in people of European decent, this IFITM3 variant is more common in Asia and Micronesia. The current study suggests that it will be important to test whether this allele might contribute to the risk of more severe Zika virus infections and birth defects, according to Brass. An expert in flaviviruses, a family of viruses transmitted by mosquitos that includes Zika, yellow fever, dengue and West Nile, Brass has developed a suite of genomic tools to probe how human cells respond to pathogens and how these invaders exploit host cell factors and proteins to replicate.  Having these tools allowed us to respond quickly when the Zika virus threat emerged,  said Brass.  We simply adapted the technology we d developed over the last four years working with dengue, influenza and other viruses to begin work on Zika virus.  The mosquito-transmitted Zika virus typically causes relatively mild symptoms in infected adults. Prior to outbreaks of the virus in Micronesia and Southeast Asia in 2007, relatively few human cases had been reported. An ongoing epidemic of Zika virus began in early 2015 in Brazil and with it new evidence emerged that Zika virus infection of women during early pregnancy can result in microcephaly, a severe brain defect in infants. There is no treatment for Zika virus infection. The best way to prevent the infection is to limit potential exposure to the infected mosquitos that carry the disease. As summer heats up and mosquito season gets under way, the World Health Organization expects the virus to spread throughout much of the Americas including parts of the United States. From their earlier research on dengue virus and other flaviviruses related to Zika virus, Brass and his group had a hunch that IFITM3 might reduce or block viral infection. Using the IFITM3 tools and assays they d developed for studying dengue and influenza viruses, the Brass lab was able to rapidly test IFITM3 s effect on Zika virus.  We just plugged Zika virus into our system and immediately began testing it,  said Brass.  What might have taken many months or longer to build, we were able to turn around in just several weeks.  Found in nearly all human cells, IFITM3 works to alter the cell membrane, making it more difficult for viruses to penetrate this outer defense. The Brass lab found that when IFITM3 levels are low, Zika virus can more readily infiltrate into the cell interior and cause infection. Conversely, they discovered that when IFITM3 is abundant and on guard, it strongly prevents Zika virus from reaching the interior of the cell and so blocks its infection.  In effect, we see that IFITM3 allows our cells to swallow up and quarantine the virus thereby stopping their own infection, and also the infection of neighboring cells  said George Savidis, a research associate in the Brass lab and the first author of the study.  We think this also reduces the levels of cell death caused by Zika virus.  This work shows that IFITM3 acts as an early front line defender to prevent Zika virus from getting its hands on all of the resources in our cells that it needs to grow,  said Savidis.  IFITM3 pretty much keeps Zika virus stuck in no man s land where it can t do anything to harm us.  The next step for Brass and his collaborators, including Sharone Green, MD, associate professor of medicine and a flavivirus expert, is to test these findings in mice that are IFITM3-deficient to see whether these animals are more susceptible to the effects of Zika virus infection. The Brass lab is also searching for small molecules that can boost the levels, and hopefully the anti-viral actions, of IFITM3. Brass believes that such molecules could be developed into therapies to treat or protect us from Zika virus, as well as a growing list of other dangerous viruses.  A lot of data by us and others in the field has shown that IFITM3 has a big impact on blocking many emerging viruses such as dengue, Zika and Ebola  said Brass.  Given our recent results with Zika virus, it s now even more important that we work to find out how IFITM3 is blocking these viruses, and use that knowledge to prevent and treat infections.

To a lower extent and particularly in cancer cells, ATP can also be generated in the cytoplasm from the energy gained during degradation of glucose. These sources of ATP are sufficient to cover the energetic needs of cells in normal conditions. However, in response to stress-inducing external signals or to extensive DNA damage, the cells need to globally reprogram their gene expression pattern, a process that requires extensive remodelling of chromatin to gain access to the regulatory information encoded in DNA. The DNA in the cell nucleus is packaged into chromatin in a form that prevents access to genetic information. Global reprogramming of gene expression to deal with stressful situations and high levels of DNA damage requires loosening the interaction of DNA with chromatin proteins. The modification of chromatin proteins consumes large amounts of energy. To cover these special needs, the cells require an extra amount of energy so, a new pathway is activated in order to get more ATP available. In a paper published on 3rd June in Science, researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) led by senior group leader Miguel Beato in collaboration with the University Pompeu Fabra, the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona, and the University Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain, have described for the first time a new pathway generating energy within the cell nucleus for remodelling chromatin and reprogramming gene expression. They have also identified the function of enzymes involved at every step of this process and how they are activated in response to stress signals. Their results, will help in understanding the mechanisms underlying chromatin remodelling, its relationship with DNA damage and, by extension, with cancer.  Exceptional situations call for extraordinary measures. When cells need to cope with a global reprogramming of gene expression they require a lot of energy in the nucleus. In these situations the cells block their mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP production to be focused on the main task in the nucleus,  says Miguel Beato, group leader at the CRG and principal investigator of this paper. Researchers found that poly-ADP-ribose (PAR), one of the main actors in chromatin de-compaction and DNA damage repair is the cornerstone for the nuclear ATP synthesis. Its building blocks of ADP-ribose are used by the nuclear enzyme NUDIX5 to generate ATP. Blocking NUDIX5 activity precludes chromatin remodelling, reprogramming of gene expression and the cell adaptation to stress or DNA damage.  Our results point to NUDIX5 as key player in nuclear ATP synthesis for chromatin remodeling. Since NUDIX5 is overexpressed in various types of cancer, this fundamental finding could contribute to targeted cancer medicine. NUDIX5 could be a biomarker for cancer stratification and a new potential target for future cancer treatment,  concludes Roni Wright, first author of the paper and CRG postdoctoral researcher.

An initiative of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the GDC will be a core component of the National Cancer Moonshot and the President s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), and benefits from $70 million allocated to NCI to lead efforts in cancer genomics as part of PMI for Oncology. The GDC will centralize, standardize and make accessible data from large-scale NCI programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and its pediatric equivalent, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. Together, TCGA and TARGET represent some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomics datasets in the world, comprising more than two petabytes of data (one petabyte is equivalent to 223,000 DVDs filled to capacity with data). In addition, the GDC will accept submissions of cancer genomic and clinical data from researchers around the world who wish to share their data broadly. In so doing, researchers will be able to use the state-of-the-art analytic methods of the GDC, allowing them to compare their findings with other data in the GDC. Data in the GDC, representing thousands of cancer patients and tumors, will be harmonized using standardized software algorithms so that they are accessible and broadly useful to any cancer researcher. The storage of raw genomic data in the GDC will also allow it to be reanalyzed as computational methods and genome annotations improve. It is important to note that, in this era of heightened concern about data security and authorized access, the GDC has important safeguards to ensure secure data storage and downloading.  With the GDC, NCI has made a major commitment to maintaining long-term storage of cancer genomic data and providing researchers with free access to these data,  said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D.  Importantly, the explanatory power of data in the GDC will grow over time as data from more patients are included, and ultimately the GDC will accelerate our efforts in precision medicine.  The GDC is being built and managed by the University of Chicago Center for Data Intensive Science, in collaboration with the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, all under an NCI contract with Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, Maryland.  Of particular significance, the GDC will also house data from a number of newer NCI programs that will sequence the DNA of patients enrolled in NCI clinical trials,  said Louis M. Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., NCI.  These datasets will lead to a much deeper understanding of which therapies are most effective for individual cancer patients. With each new addition, the GDC will evolve into a smarter, more comprehensive knowledge system that will foster important discoveries in cancer research and increase the success of cancer treatment for patients.  The hope is that the GDC will form the basis for a comprehensive knowledge system for cancer. GDC researchers will be able to integrate genetic and clinical data, such as cancer imaging and histological data, with information on the molecular profiles of tumors as well as treatment response. From this perspective, the GDC would become an important resource for generating potentially actionable and life-changing information that ultimately could be used by doctors and their patients.","Published: June 7, 2016"

What if there were a drug that could specifically block pain, but leave the rest of your sensations alone? In order to do this, you would need to find a way to control the cohort of nerve fibers that transmit the specific type of pain you would like to block. A research team led by UC San Francisco scientists has discovered molecules that may help researchers do just that: two toxins isolated from the venom of Heteroscodra maculata, a West African tarantula the size of your hand (commonly referred to as the  ornamental baboon  or ""Togo starburst  tarantula). This spider s massive fangs deliver a poison that causes excruciating pain in part by triggering a specific kind of sodium channel within A-delta nerve fibers, according to the new research. The study was led by researchers in the lab of David Julius, PhD, Chair of the Department of Physiology at UCSF, and was published June 6, 2016 in the journal Nature. The researchers are excited about this finding for two equally important reasons: for opening a new chapter in our understanding of pain, and because the new toxins can now be used as a highly selective tool for manipulating this type of sodium channel, which also has been implicated in neurological disorders unrelated to pain, from epilepsy to autism to Alzheimer s disease.  It s a good problem to have,  said Jeremiah Osteen, PhD, the postdoctoral fellow in Julius s group who led the research team.  We didn t know which of the two findings we should be more excited about.  Poisonous Creatures Reveal Tools for Pain, Neurological Research Julius s lab   which is renowned for the discovery and characterization of the so-called  wasabi receptor    has recently been working to identify new pain pathways by screening more than a hundred different venoms from poisonous spiders, scorpions, and centipedes   sourced from the collection of co-author Glenn F. King, PhD, of the University of Queensland in Australia   all of which have evolved chemical defenses that target the biology of animals  pain nerves.  There are dozens to hundreds of different active peptides in each animal s venom,  Julius said.  The deeper you look the more toxins there seem to be.  The Togo starburst tarantula s venom struck them as being particularly interesting because it appeared to activate a particular type of sodium channel within sensory nerves that was not a part of known pain pathways. To identify which of the dozens of chemicals that made up the tarantula s venom were specifically targeting these channels, the researchers separated the venom and applied the components one-by-one to rodent sensory neurons in a lab dish. They found two peptide molecules that specifically and powerfully activated these sensory nerves, and experiments with lab-synthesized versions of the same molecules confirmed that these chemicals could activate pain-sensing neurons on their own. Experiments with an array of different drugs that block candidate receptor molecules demonstrated that the two toxins specifically bind to and demonstrated that this particular receptor is indeed found on A-delta nerves in mice. The accepted notion is that A-delta fibers may convey the sharp, immediate shock of a burn or a cut, ahead of the burning throb conveyed by slower C fibers. The newly discovered tarantula peptides allowed the researchers to isolate A-delta fibers in mice, and show that they also appear to play a role in touch hypersensitivity   when normally innocuous light touch causes discomfort   a type of pain common to diseases like shingles and many chronic pain syndromes. Nine Subtly Different Voltage-Sensitive Sodium Channels Additional experiments also implicated heightened touch sensitivity of Nav1.1-expressing nerves in a mouse model of irritable bowel syndrome, suggesting these nerves, and this channel, may play a role in the chronic discomfort such patients experience. The pharmacological aspect of the research is also exciting for researchers because the nine subtly different voltage-sensitive sodium channels that are critical for nervous system function are extremely hard to manipulate individually. Researchers have been on a decades-long quest to find selective drugs for each subtype, so identifying two in one spider is a valuable find.  These channels are incredibly hard to identify drugs for because the different subtypes are closely related, making it difficult to identify drugs or other agents that act on one subtype and not another,  Julius said.  These toxins provide unique tools to start understanding exactly what this particular subtype, Nav1.1, does in terms of pain sensation.  The Nav1.1 subtype in particular has been implicated in the development of diseases including epilepsy, autism, and Alzheimer s disease, and the researchers hope that in addition to helping scientists understand the biology of pain, the new discovery will lead to the development of new drugs to target these diseases.  These spiders had millions of years of evolution to come up with these potent and specific toxins,  Osteen said.  They re tools one might be hard pressed to design as well in the lab.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetically-engineered-crops-are-safe-195706,Genetically Engineered Crops Are Safe Distinction between genetic engineering and conventional plant breeding becoming less clear  says new report on GE crops  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An extensive study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has found that new technologies in genetic engineering and conventional breeding are blurring the once clear distinctions between these two crop-improvement approaches. In addition, while recognizing the inherent difficulty of detecting subtle or long-term effects on health or the environment, the study committee found no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks to human health between current commercially available genetically engineered (GE) crops and conventionally bred crops, nor did it find conclusive cause-and-effect evidence of environmental problems from the GE crops. However, evolved resistance to current GE characteristics in crops is a major agricultural problem. A tiered process for regulating new crop varieties should focus on a plant s characteristics rather than the process by which it was developed, the committee recommends in its report. New plant varieties that have intended or unintended novel characteristics that may present potential hazards should undergo safety testing -- regardless of whether they were developed using genetic engineering or conventional breeding techniques. New  -omics  technologies, which dramatically increase the ability to detect even small changes in plant characteristics, will be critical to detecting unintended changes in new crop varieties. The committee used evidence accumulated over the past two decades to assess purported negative effects and purported benefits of current commercial GE crops. Since the 1980s, biologists have used genetic engineering to produce particular characteristics in plants such as longer shelf life for fruit, higher vitamin content, and resistance to diseases. However, the only genetically engineered characteristics that have been put into widespread commercial use are those that allow a crop to withstand the application of a herbicide or to be toxic to insect pests. The fact that only two characteristics have been widely used is one of the reasons the committee avoided sweeping, generalized statements about the benefits and risks of GE crops. Claims about the effects of existing GE crops often assume that those effects would apply to the genetic engineering process generally, but different characteristics are likely to have different effects. A genetically engineered characteristic that alters the nutritional content of a crop, for example, is unlikely to have the same environmental or economic effects as a characteristic for herbicide resistance. The committee examined almost 900 research and other publications on the development, use, and effects of genetically engineered characteristics in maize (corn), soybean, and cotton, which account for almost all commercial GE crops to date.  We dug deeply into the literature to take a fresh look at the data on GE and conventionally bred crops,  said committee chair Fred Gould, University Distinguished Professor of Entomology and co-director of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University. In addition, the committee heard from 80 diverse speakers at three public meetings and 15 public webinars, and read more than 700 comments from members of the public to broaden its understanding of issues surrounding GE crops. In releasing its report, the committee established a website that enables users to look up the places in the report that address comments received by the committee from the public, and also find the reasoning behind the report s main findings and recommendations.  The committee focused on listening carefully and responding thoughtfully to members of the public who have concerns about GE crops and foods, as well as those who feel that there are great benefits to be had from GE crops,  said Gould. Effects on human health. The committee carefully searched all available research studies for persuasive evidence of adverse health effects directly attributable to consumption of foods derived from GE crops but found none. Studies with animals and research on the chemical composition of GE foods currently on the market reveal no differences that would implicate a higher risk to human health and safety than from eating their non-GE counterparts. Though long-term epidemiological studies have not directly addressed GE food consumption, available epidemiological data do not show associations between any disease or chronic conditions and the consumption of GE foods. There is some evidence that GE insect-resistant crops have had benefits to human health by reducing insecticide poisonings. In addition, several GE crops are in development that are designed to benefit human health, such as rice with increased beta-carotene content to help prevent blindness and death caused by vitamin A deficiencies in some developing nations. Effects on the environment. The use of insect-resistant or herbicide-resistant crops did not reduce the overall diversity of plant and insect life on farms, and sometimes insect-resistant crops resulted in increased insect diversity, the report says. While gene flow   the transfer of genes from a GE crop to a wild relative species   has occurred, no examples have demonstrated an adverse environmental effect from this transfer. Overall, the committee found no conclusive evidence of cause-and-effect relationships between GE crops and environmental problems. However, the complex nature of assessing long-term environmental changes often made it difficult to reach definitive conclusions. Effects on agriculture. The available evidence indicates that GE soybean, cotton, and maize have generally had favorable economic outcomes for producers who have adopted these crops, but outcomes have varied depending on pest abundance, farming practices, and agricultural infrastructure. Although GE crops have provided economic benefits to many small-scale farmers in the early years of adoption, enduring and widespread gains will depend on such farmers receiving institutional support, such as access to credit, affordable inputs such as fertilizer, extension services, and access to profitable local and global markets for the crops. Evidence shows that in locations where insect-resistant crops were planted but resistance-management strategies were not followed, damaging levels of resistance evolved in some target insects. If GE crops are to be used sustainably, regulations and incentives are needed so that more integrated and sustainable pest-management approaches become economically feasible. The committee also found that in many locations some weeds had evolved resistance to glyphosate, the herbicide to which most GE crops were engineered to be resistant. Resistance evolution in weeds could be delayed by the use of integrated weed-management approaches, says the report, which also recommends further research to determine better approaches for weed resistance management. Insect-resistant GE crops have decreased crop loss due to plant pests. However, the committee examined data on overall rates of increase in yields of soybean, cotton, and maize in the U.S. for the decades preceding introduction of GE crops and after their introduction, and there was no evidence that GE crops had changed the rate of increase in yields. It is feasible that emerging genetic-engineering technologies will speed the rate of increase in yield, but this is not certain, so the committee recommended funding of diverse approaches for increasing and stabilizing crop yield. Regulation Should Focus on Novel Characteristics and Hazards All technologies for improving plant genetics   whether GE or conventional -- can change foods in ways that could raise safety issues, the committee s report notes. It is the product and not the process that should be regulated, the new report says, a point that has also been made in previous Academies reports. In determining whether a new plant variety should be subject to safety testing, regulators should focus on the extent to which the novel characteristics of the plant variety (both intended and unintended) are likely to pose a risk to human health or the environment, the extent of uncertainty about the severity of potential harm, and the potential for human exposure   regardless of whether the plant was developed using genetic-engineering or conventional-breeding processes.    omics  technologies will be critical in enabling these regulatory approaches. The United States  current policy on new plant varieties is in theory a  product  based policy, but USDA and EPA determine which plants to regulate at least partially based on the process by which they are developed. But a process-based approach is becoming less and less technically defensible as the old approaches to genetic engineering become less novel and as emerging processes   such as genome editing and synthetic biology   fail to fit current regulatory categories of genetic engineering, the report says. The distinction between conventional breeding and genetic engineering is becoming less obvious, says the report, which also reviews emerging technologies. For example, genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 can now be used to make a genetic change by substituting a single nucleotide in a specific gene; the same change can be made by a method that uses radiation or chemicals to induce mutations and then uses genomic screening to identify plants with the desired mutation   an approach that is considered to be conventional breeding by most national regulatory systems. Some emerging genetic engineering technologies have the potential to create novel plant varieties that are hard to distinguish genetically from plants produced through conventional breeding or processes that occur in nature. A plant variety that is conventionally bred to be resistant to a herbicide and one that is genetically engineered to be resistant to the same herbicide can be expected to have similar associated benefits and risks. Regulating authorities should be proactive in communicating information to the public about how emerging genetic-engineering technologies or their products might be regulated and how new regulatory methods may be used. They should also proactively seek input from the public on these issues. Not all issues can be answered by science alone, the report says.  Policy regarding GE crops has scientific, legal, and social dimensions. For example, on the basis of its review of the evidence on health effects, the committee does not believe that mandatory labeling of foods with GE content is justified to protect public health, but it noted that the issue involves social and economic choices that go beyond technical assessments of health or environmental safety; ultimately, it involves value choices that technical assessments alone cannot answer.

Given the wealth of multisensory information constantly bombarding us, however, how does our brain know which signals go together and thus need to be combined? And how does it integrate such related signals? Scientists from the Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC) at Bielefeld University and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics have proposed a computational model that explains multisensory integration in humans utilizing a surprisingly simple processing unit. This research, funded by the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, appears in Nature Communications. See Also: New insights into underlying cellular mechanisms of information processing in the brain A sudden explosion, cracking sounds and flashing lights. In a blink of an eye, you realize that sounds and lights belong together, you look down and see firecrackers on the sidewalk. The human brain is surprisingly efficient at processing multisensory information. However, we still do not know how it solves the seemingly simple task of deciding whether sound and light belong together or not. ""Figuring out a correspondence between the senses is by no means a trivial problem"" says Dr. Cesare Parise, who works at CITEC in the research group Cognitive Neurosciences. Parise, who is also active at the Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, is the lead author of the new study, which he wrote together with Professor Dr. Marc Ernst, who conducted research at Bielefeld University through March 2016. ""Despite originating from the same physical events, visual and auditory information are processed in largely independent neural pathways, and yet, with no apparent effort, we can instantly tell which signals belong together. Such a task would be challenging, even for the most advanced robots"". To understand how humans combine visual and auditory information, volunteers agreed to par-ticipate to a perception experiment in which they observed random sequences of clicks and flashes. After each sequence, they had to report whether sound and light perceptually be-longed together, and which signal appeared first. Statistical analyses revealed that human responses were systematically determined by the similarity (i.e., correlation) of the temporal sequences of the clicks and flashes. ""This is a very important finding,"" says Prof. March Ernst, ""not just because it shows that the brain uses the temporal correlation of sound and light to detect whether or not they are physically related, but also because it opens an even more intriguing question: how does the brain detect correlation across the senses?"" Don't Miss: How the brain learns to distinguish between what is important and what is not To answer this question, Parise and Ernst used computational modeling and computer simulations, and identified an elementary neural mechanism that could closely replicate human perception. Such a mechanism called the Multisensory Correlation Detector monitors the senses and looks for similarity (correlation) across visual and auditory signals: if the stimuli have a similar temporal structure, the brain concludes that they belong together, and integrates the stimuli. Remarkably enough, this mechanism is surprisingly similar to the motion detectors found in the insect brain. ""This is exciting because it shows that the brain systematically exploits general-purpose processing strategies, which can be implemented across very different domains of perception where the correlation between signals is a key feature, such as the perception of visual motion, 3D perception using binocular disparities, binaural hearing, and now multisensory processing. Furthermore, such correlation mechanisms can be found in very different animal species, from insects to vertebrates, including humans"", says Prof. Marc Ernst, who has just accepted a new position at Ulm University. To further test the generalizability of this model, Parise and Ernst ran additional computer simulations, where they used the Multisensory Correlation Detector model to replicate several previous findings on the temporal and the spatial aspects of multisensory perception. Without further changes, the same model proved capable of replicating human perception in all simulated studies, and displayed the same temporal and spatial constraints of multisensory perception found in humans.

""This result has strong application potential"" says Dr. Parise: ""A deep understanding of multisensory processing opens new clinical perspectives for neurological syndromes that are associated with multisensory impairments, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Dyslexia. Moreover, our computational model could be easily implemented for use in robots and artificial perception"". Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

But each time, the tumor resisted harder. Each time, he felt more side effects. Surgery helped remove some of the tumor, but not enough. So doctors at University of Michigan's CS Mott Children's Hospital took a new approach, combining the forces of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a nonconventional way. After 17 rounds of the combination treatment, Emil's tumor was completely gone. See Also: Promising results reported in study of pediatric neuroblastoma The now-kindergartner is among a group of patients with hard-to-treat neuroblastoma who responded so well to the novel treatment combination in a Children's Oncology Group international clinical trial that researchers plan to expand the study to include more children. CS Mott pediatric oncologist Rajen Mody, MD, who led the research, presented the preliminary findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. Neuroblastoma is the third most common type of cancer in children, usually starting in the kidneys, spreading throughout the body and primarily affecting children younger than five. When standard therapies don't work like in Emil's case, or the cancer returns, the battle against the disease is grim less than 5 percent of these young patients survive. After the first year of receiving the novel treatment combination in the COG trial, 9 out of 17 children with relapsed or resistant neuroblastoma saw either a complete or partial remission a 53 percent response rate compared to the typical 10 to 12 percent response rate from chemotherapy or biologic therapy alone. ""The outcomes for relapsed neuroblastoma are dismal, and treatment options are limited,"" Mody says. ""We found that in more than half of patients receiving this new combination therapy the tumor either shrunk or completely disappeared, which we consider an extraordinary success. Our study was small, but the results are so striking they warrant further research to study the biological basis of why this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy works so well."" The phase II COG trial involved 35 patients, but researchers are planning to open a larger form of the trial soon. Learn More: Neurons, brain cancer cells require the same little-known protein for long-term survival Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor caused by uncontrolled or abnormal cell growth in nerve cells. Doctors think the cancer cells in patients whose bodies resist treatment against neuroblastoma have found a way to keep immune cells from doing their job and fighting the cancer cells. Typically, patients with neuroblastoma undergo one of two types of therapy chemotherapy, which uses drugs to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells, or immunotherapy, which stimulates the immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells. The two treatments have typically always been used on their own, however, not simultaneously. The COG trial provided patients with a novel combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs to re-engage the immune cells to recognize and attack the cancer cells. The combination has been used successfully in other diseases, such as lymphoma. Emil's mother Feruza Alishanova recalls watching her son ""get weaker every day while the cancer got stronger,"" and the disease seeming ""unbeatable"" with every chemo treatment. She says she's thankful he responded to the new therapy and hopes more research helps other children, too. Emil, now six years old, graduates from kindergarten in June in Okemos, Michigan. Don't Miss: Cancer genes turned off in deadly brain cancer Neuroblastoma affects about 700 people a year in the US and accounts for 6 percent of all childhood cancers in the country. The disease sometimes forms before birth, but is most often discovered later in life as the tumor grows and affects the body. ""What we are learning through this research could revolutionize treatment for children with relapsed or hard to treat neuroblastoma,"" Mody says. ""We hope this is the beginning of a path to learning how to cure cancer in more children facing this devastating disease.""

As we hear the words people speak, we also see their lips move. We smell, see and hear the onions as we chop them and we feel them with teary eyes. It turns out that the ability to judge such sensory inputs as simultaneous, and therefore likely pertaining to the same thing, is something animal brains must develop through experience. A new study using tadpoles as a model organism shows how that appears to happen. See Also: How the brain merges the sensesIn making their findings, the scientists hope they can better understand how this sensory integration may sometimes go askew, perhaps contributing to disorders including autism. Some studies have suggested that difficulty merging sound and vision in some autism disorders may lead to language deficits.  People have tried to distill how the brain detects this temporal coincidence,  said study corresponding author Carlos Aizenman, a professor of neuroscience at Brown University.  We created a preparation where we could study how the different inputs are combined in a single cell and what types of brain circuits are involved.  In the study published in eLife, Aizenman, lead author Daniel Felch and Bard College colleague Arseny Khakhalin were able to electrically stimulate the senses of vision and vibration in the brains of tadpoles at key stages of their neural development. They did so with very precise timing (small fractions of a second apart) and then tracked the responses of neurons in the optic tectum of the tadpole brains, where sensory information is processed and integrated. In humans and other mammals, the same part of the brain is called the superior colliculus, and neurons there do the same job. The scientists found that sensory integration neurons in the optic tectum in relatively immature tadpole brains would become and remain excited by receiving two stimuli even if they were somewhat far apart in time. As the tadpole brains matured into later stages of development the same neural circuits would squelch their initial excitement if the sensory inputs came similarly far apart. More mature brains became better at determining when stimuli were nearly simultaneous and suppressing excitement when they weren t. Learn More: The Brain s Balancing Act: How neurons equalize between excitation and inhibition The results suggest that as tadpole brains mature, inhibitory neurons gain more sway in their balance with excitatory neurons, leading to more refined discrimination between sensory inputs that are truly simultaneous rather than merely proximate in time. In one experiment of the study, the scientists blocked inhibition. That stunted the tadpole brains  ability to discriminate. The study illustrates, as others have as well, how sensory experiences shape the developing brain, Aizenman said.  The brain normally starts out poorly wired,  he said.  Activity in the brain sculpts the response of the brain to have a much more refined and fine-tuned function.  What s new is that the research also explains the mechanism by which that happens and shows that it can be derailed.  The balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain is important for creating this type of temporal window,  Aizenman said.  If you disrupt it, you get abnormal multisensory processing.  Related: Sensory feedback shapes individuality to provide equal space for behavioral excellence In future work, Aizenman said he hopes to do more of that: experiment with different ways of perturbing the process at different times during development to see what effect that may have on tadpole behaviors such as finding food or avoiding danger. Tadpoles do not experience language, of course, but the results may still contribute, at a basic level, to generating hypotheses about how sensory integration may be affected in human development. Even though they develop somewhat differently and encounter different experiences, tadpoles and people share the same basic brain organization.  What s important here are not the things that are different, but the things that are the same,  Aizenman said.  The fundamental principles are conserved.

The fourth will be presented as an E-poster. Additionally, SkylineDx will host a  Meet the Experts  event in booth #C4.328 on June 10, from 2:30   3:30 p.m. (CEST). Each of the four new abstracts utilized MMprofiler and its novel gene signature, SKY92, to determine the prognostic validity in both the clinical and analytical setting in identifying high risk or standard risk stratification in patients with multiple myeloma. Results show that the SKY92 signature, a key component of MMprofiler, is a powerful and robust prognostic marker, not only for overall survival, but also for progression free survival in younger, elderly, newly diagnosed, and relapsed patients with multiple myeloma across various treatments. Moreover, it can be used reliably as a predictor for survival to optimize follow-up and treatment strategies in an early stage.  We are pleased to showcase MMprofiler and its reliability in determining risk stratification to optimize treatment in patients with multiple myeloma through these four posters,  said Dharminder S. Chahal, Chief Executive Officer of SkylineDx.  We are confident that these additional studies will help inform patients and physicians with clinically actionable information that will guide and speed up the therapeutic decision-making process, no matter what stage of the disease the patient is experiencing.  MMprofiler with SKY92 is a gene-based risk identification signature that determines the level of risk for patients with multiple myeloma by classifying them into a  high  or  standard  risk group. MMprofiler assesses risk by measuring the activity of 92 genes (the SKY92 gene signature) that are directly or indirectly related to the disease. Patients with a  high  risk classification have a poor prognosis as compared to patients with a standard risk profile, regardless of treatment. The performance of the SKY92 gene signature to risk stratify these patients exceeds that of standard clinical parameters that include FISH, and earlier gene expression signatures utilized in myeloma.  With the information that MMprofiler provides, physicians are now able to make better informed decisions,  said Antonio Palumbo, M.D., Chief of Myeloma Unit, Department of Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.  The power to classify a patient s risk level using MMprofiler enables the physician to potentially tailor a more precise and beneficial treatment for their multiple myeloma patient, thus potentially avoiding ineffective, costly, or potentially harmful treatments.

Each word is read by a molecule known as a tRNA.  We ve long thought of these molecules as little more than middle men participating in the process of translating proteins,  explains Sohail Tavazoie, Leon Hess Associate Professor and head Rockefeller University s Elizabeth and Vincent Meyer Laboratory of Systems Cancer Biology. But new research conducted in his lab suggests tRNA dynamics may play an important role in modulating the types of proteins in a cell. In work published in Cell, Tavazoie and his colleagues describe how fluctuations in the amount of tRNAs can have a dramatic impact not only on the fate of a single cell, but also on diseases like metastatic breast cancer. Spelling matters Some words in the English language can be spelled in more than one way like  color  and  colour,  which mean the same thing. The same is true for our genetic code. When cells activate a gene to make protein, their genome spells out three-letter words known as codons. Each codon is specific for one building block of a protein. But in some cases, two or several codons signify the same building block. The codons are read by tRNAs, with one tRNA corresponding to each spelling. All living things use the same language, but codon usage and tRNA availability varies among different organisms and different tissues just as the spelling  colour  predominates among the British, while  color  is more common among Americans. Subtle changes have big consequences For decades, researchers have assumed that these tRNAs had little impact on the function of the cell. But these molecules have been difficult to study, and Tavazoie s team wanted to know if changes in the amount of tRNAs can affect cellular function.  Traditionally, it has been hard to use standard methods to quantify the amount of tRNA in the cell,  says Tavazoie. The lead authors of the article, Hani Goodarzi, formerly a postdoc in the lab and now a new assistant professor at UCSF, and research assistant Hoang Nguyen, devised and applied a new method that utilizes state-of-the-art genomic sequencing technology to measure the amount of tRNAs in different cell types. The team chose to compare breast tissue from healthy individuals with tumor samples taken from breast cancer patients including both primary tumors that had not spread from the breast to other body sites, and highly aggressive, metastatic tumors. They found that the levels of two specific tRNAs were significantly higher in metastatic cells and metastatic tumors than in primary tumors that did not metastasize or healthy samples.  There are six different ways to encode for the protein building block arginine,  explains Tavazoie.  Yet only one of those the tRNA that recognizes the codon CGG was associated with increased metastasis.  The tRNA that recognizes the codon GAA and encodes for a building block known as glutamic acid was also elevated in metastatic samples. The team hypothesized that the elevated levels of these tRNAs may in fact drive metastasis. Working in mouse models of primary, non-metastatic tumors, the researchers increased the production of the tRNAs, and found that these cells became much more invasive and metastatic. They also did the inverse experiment, with the anticipated results: reducing the levels of these tRNAs in metastatic cells decreased the incidence of metastases in the animals. Driving metastasis How do two tRNAs drive metastasis? The researchers teamed up with members of the Rockefeller University proteomics facility to see how protein expression changes in cells with elevated levels of these two tRNAs.  We found global increases in many dozens of genes,  says Tavazoie,  so we analyzed their sequences and found that the majority of them had significantly increased numbers of these two specific codons.  According to the researchers, two genes stood out among the list. Known as EXOSC2 and GRIPAP1, these genes were strongly and directly induced by elevated levels of the specific glutamic acid tRNA.  When we mutated the GAA codons to GAG  a  silent  mutation because they both spell out the protein building block glutamic acid we found that increasing the amount of tRNA no longer increased protein levels,  explains Tavazoie. These proteins were found to drive breast cancer metastasis. The work challenges previous assumptions about how tRNAs function and suggests that tRNAs can modulate gene expression, according to the researchers. Tavazoie points out that  it is remarkable that within a single cell type, synonymous changes in genetic sequence can dramatically affect the levels of specific proteins, their transcripts, and the way a cell behaves.

The typical form of the peppered moth has light-coloured wings. However, during the industrial revolution the dark form displaced the lighter form by blending in with the sooty bark on urban trees and avoiding predation. In a new paper published in Nature, scientists have discovered that a  jumping gene  mutation was responsible for this dark variant. Using statistical modelling, this mutation has been independently dated to around 1819, which is consistent with the historical record. Jumping genes Jumping genes, more formally known as transposable elements (TEs), are mobile segments of DNA that can change their position within a genome and alter the expression of other genes. Using fine-scale linkage and association mapping combined with next-generation DNA sequencing, the team established that a large transposable element, inserted within the moth s cortex gene, was responsible for the colour change. Dr Ilik Saccheri, from the University s Institute of Integrative Biology, who led the research, said:  This discovery fills a fundamental gap in the peppered moth story. The fact that this famous mutant is caused by a transposable element will hopefully attract more interest in the impact of mobile DNA on fitness and the generation of novel phenotypes.  Back in time The first documented sighting of a black peppered moth is from Manchester in northern England, in 1848. However, it could have existed undetected in the moth population at very low frequency for many years earlier. To independently estimate when the mutation happened, the team used a simulation-based statistical  time machine  to infer the number of generations needed to arrive at the observed pattern of variation in the DNA sequence flanking the transposable element. Dr Pascal Campagne, who worked on the study, said:  Our best estimate of 1819 shows that the mutation event occurred during the industrial revolution and that it took around 30 years for it to become common enough to be noticed.  Co-author Dr Arjen van t Hof added:  These findings provide an opportunity to further develop peppered moth industrial melanism as a tool for teaching evolutionary biology and the genetic basis of adaptation.  Butterfly findings A parallel paper in the same journal by researchers from the Universities of Cambridge and Sheffield reveals that the same cortex gene also enables tropical butterflies to mimic each other s bright and colourful patterning. Dr Saccheri commented:  This is highly unexpected, both because the butterfly and moth polymorphisms appear very different to the eye, and the species are separated by over 100 million years. What this suggests is that the cortex gene is central to generating pattern diversity across the Lepidoptera, and more generally that adaptive evolution often relies on a conserved toolkit of developmental switches.

Cancer can give hints of its presence through specific proteins that appear in the bloodstream, but even then, these cancer  signatures  may be so few in number   about a million to a billion times lower than other proteins in the blood   that they can go undetected. Many cancer diagnostic tests   such as the prostate specific antigen-based screening   don t work well until a cancer has proliferated enough to present itself in large numbers in blood tests. By then, the cancer is advancing and possibly already dangerous. So scientists are continually looking for better cancer tests, ones that could quickly detect the cancer s telltale presence before it takes hold. Ali Rohani, a University of Virginia graduate student in electrical engineering, and his colleagues in several UVA School of Medicine clinical groups and the School of Engineering and Applied Science may have found a way to find the earliest signs of prostate cancer with a small lab-on-a-chip-type device they are developing. It s a way to pick through the sea of normal proteins in the blood to find the relative few that are associated with prostate cancer. Rohani   who leads the project under the supervision of Nathan Swami, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering   calls it  finding Waldo,  as in the  Where s Waldo?  game for children. In books and online pictures, a character named Waldo is hidden among tens of dozens of other characters. Players are challenged to find Waldo among the masses by identifying his unique characteristics: his hat, glasses, shirt and other features.  In order to bring early cancer detection into reality, we should stop looking blindly for a needle in a haystack with our bare hands,  Rohani said.  We should play a different game. We should identify the distinctive look of Waldo.  Rohani is looking for his Waldo by identifying the characteristic electrical properties of the prostate cancer protein because, like other proteins, it has its own distinctive  chemical topology  and shows itself under a specific set of frequencies. Rohani uses his specially designed nano-device chip to create a salt-depleted region within a high-salt clinical serum sample by applying finely tuned electrical signals   signals set at the specific frequency to stimulate prostate cancer proteins. This creates what he calls a  black hole  on the chip where all the prostate-specific protein is concentrated and trapped in a specific area, while all other proteins are kept outside of that concentration. This allows Rohani to find the specific protein he is looking for, even when there are only trace amounts. This ultimately would allow detection of cancer at the very earliest and most highly treatable stages of development.  Our device speeds up detection about 100 times,  Rohani said.  By enhancing the trapping efficiency of cancer proteins by up to 150 times over the current state-of-the-art technologies that enrich these proteins by using antibodies, we have achieved more than a 250,000 times increase in the local concentration of rare prostate-specific antigens, and have successfully detected them under conditions very similar to early stage prostate cancer.  We have found our Waldo!  Rohani noted that the localized enrichment and selectivity features within his nanostructured chip help to prevent both false negative results during early cancer stages, and false positives of recurrence or relapse after treatment   both problems of current cancer diagnosis techniques.  We envision that all we will need for a bright future for diagnosing cancer will be a single drop of blood and 10 seconds of detection time on our device   no harder than treating a common cold,  Rohani said. He is looking to create a start-up company centered around the new technology. Early results from the research were published late last year in the journal Lab on a Chip. This study is ongoing in Swami s Nano Electro MagneticS lab, in collaboration with Lindsay Bazydlo, a professor of pathology.","Published: June 3, 2016"

When developing a new drug for market, pharmaceutical companies must not only demonstrate that it is effective at treating a particular condition, but also that the drug does not have any adverse side-effects in patients. For example, the Food and Drug Administration, which approves all new medicines for use in the USA, has defined that any new anti-diabetic medicines need to demonstrate cardiovascular safety. However, in many cases adverse safety profiles do not become apparent until late in the drug development process, by which point millions   possibly even billions   of pounds will have been invested. In a study published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, scientists have provided a proof of concept that it is possible to use genetic analyses to demonstrate systematically at a very early stage whether a drug will alter the risk of developing other conditions. A major class of anti-diabetic therapies are those known as glucose-lowering glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R)-agonists.  These drugs bind to the GLP-1 receptor (which is encoded by the GLP1R gene) to increase insulin production, helping reduce levels of blood sugar. However, the cardiovascular safety, of this class of agents, including the risk of heart disease for example, remains unknown. By analysing genetic variations in DNA encoding drug targets for type 2 diabetes and obesity in almost 12,000 individuals, the researchers identified a variant in the GLP1R gene that was associated with lower fasting glucose and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes   in other words, the variant appeared to mimic the action of the diabetes drugs. They confirmed this result in a further 40,000 individuals. The researchers then used genetic data available through an international data-sharing consortium to study the association of that same variant with coronary heart disease in almost 62,000 individuals with coronary heart disease and over 160,000 controls. In fact, they found that the variant actually reduced the risk of heart disease. Long-term large-scale randomised controlled clinical trials to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of GLP1R-agonists are underway and results from a large trial are scheduled to be released later this month.  This further suggests that human genetics can support the development of new therapies, and can offer insights into their safety profile early in the development process,  says Dr Robert Scott from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, the study s first author. Professor Nick Wareham, Director of the MRC Epidemiology Unit, added:  These findings suggest that beyond their effectiveness in treating diabetes, these drugs may have the added benefit of lowering risk of heart disease.   Researching and developing new medicines is a lengthy, expensive and risky journey, and any insights we can gain in to the processes of the body related to disease could help improve our ability to succeed,  says Dr Dawn Waterworth, joint senior author from GSK.  By pooling our resources and expertise in collaborations like this one with Cambridge University, we believe there s an opportunity to expand our knowledge of disease biology, which in turn could help reduce the risk of late-stage failures and accelerate the development of innovative new treatments for patients.  The study was primarily funded by GSK and the Medical Research Council.","Published: June 3, 2016"

The study focused on parkin   a protein involved in the degradation and purging of both damaged proteins and mitochondria via a process known as lysosomal autophagy. Mutations of parkin are linked to a rare familial form of PD, whereby the cell loses the ability to recycle its internal garbage.  PD is characterized by the accumulation of damaged proteins and mitochondria in the area of the brain where the neurotransmitter dopamine is produced. In this study scientists, led by Buck faculty Julie Andersen, PhD, showed that oxidative stress, which is one of the main drivers of sporadic PD, affected the parkin protein in the same way that genetic mutations do.  This gives us a significant insight into sporadic PD which accounts for 95 percent of all cases of the disease,  said Andersen.  We also determined that the signaling pathway involved in the molecular dysfunction is a good target for drug development.  The pathway involves two master regulatory proteins, PGC-1alpha which affects the synthesis of new mitochondria and TFEB which is involved in breaking down old mitochondria. Both are down-regulated following oxidative stress.  When scientists genetically increased the expression of PGC-1alpha in the affected mice, mitochondrial function was restored, preventing the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affected by PD. Researchers in the Andersen and Lithgow labs are now screening compounds in human cell culture and in nematode worms that have been genetically engineered to develop PD-like characteristics. The goal is to identify compounds that target the pathway and prevent the neurotoxic damage associated with the disease.","Published: June 3, 2016"

This is because growers plant different crop varieties that flower at different times of year   known in the world of horticulture as the  heading date .  Crop varieties with different heading dates are usually the result of a long process of selective breeding based on cross breeding plants with a desired trait or set of characteristics.  In new research published in The Plant Journal, Professor Caroline Dean and her research team explored the molecular basis for this heading date variation in broccoli.  When we use selective plant breeding to develop a new crop variety, we can grow the plants and see the effects of that process, but we don t really know what s going on at the genetic level; what genes we re actually selecting for,  said Professor Dean. Through a series of laboratory, greenhouse and field-based experiments using both broccoli and the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana (a relative of the brassica vegetable family), Professor Dean and her team were able to show that small changes in a gene called FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) are responsible for the range of heading dates found in different broccoli varieties. FLC is a gene that blocks flowering so necessitating overwintering in many flowering plants. Professor Dean said:  In previous work, we showed that the reference plant Arabidopsis has adapted to many different climates by modulating how quickly the FLC gene is switched off during winter.  Here we have shown that when we breed broccoli varieties to head at different times of the year, we re actually selecting the same gene in broccoli, BoFLC.C2.  Different versions of the Brassica gene require more or less cold before the gene is switched off and flowering can begin.  Dr Judith Irwin, a crop geneticist at the John Innes Centre and first author of The Plant Journal paper said:  Identifying that the BoFLC.C2 gene is involved in heading time variation means we now have a target for plant breeding programs to develop new brassica varieties. This will be especially important in the face of climate change, because our weather patterns and climate conditions are changing and we need new vegetable varieties to be resilient to this change.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/reading-between-the-genes-206916,Reading Between the Genes Researchers develop technique allowing them to map important regulatory DNA regions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Our genes decide about many things in our lives   what we look like, which talents we have, or what kind of diseases we develop. However, genes make up only two percent of our hereditary material. For a long time dismissed as  junk DNA , we now know that also the regions between the genes fulfil vital functions. They contain a complex control machinery with thousands of molecular switches that regulate the activity of our genes. Mutations in those DNA regions can severely impair development in humans and may lead to serious diseases later in life. Until now, however, regulatory DNA regions have been hard to find. Scientists around Patrick Cramer at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Biophysical Chemistry in G ttingen and Julien Gagneur at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now developed a method to find regulatory DNA regions which are active and controlling genes. The genes in our DNA contain detailed assembly instructions for proteins, the  workers  carrying out and controlling virtually all processes in our cells. To ensure that each protein fulfils its tasks at the right time in the right place of our body, the activity of the corresponding gene has to be tightly controlled. This function is taken over by regulatory DNA regions between the genes, which act as a complex control machinery.  Regulatory DNA regions are essential for development in humans, tissue preservation, and the immune response, among others,  explains Patrick Cramer, head of the Department for Molecular Biology at the MPI for Biophysical Chemistry.  Furthermore, they play an important role in various diseases. For example, patients suffering from cancer or cardiovascular conditions show many mutations in exactly those DNA regions,  the biochemist says. When regulatory DNA regions are active, they are first copied into RNA.  The resulting RNA molecules have a great disadvantage for us researchers though: The cell rapidly degrades them, thus they were hard to find until now,  reports Julien Gagneur, who recently moved with this group from the Gene Center of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit t Munich to the TUM.  But exactly those short-lived RNA molecules often act as vital molecular switches that specifically activate genes needed in a certain place of our body. Without these molecular switches, our genes would not be functional."" An anchor for short-lived molecular switches Bj rn Schwalb and Margaux Michel, members of Cramer s team, as well as Benedikt Zacher, scientist in Gagneur s group, have now succeeded in developing a highly sensitive method to catch and identify even very short-lived RNA molecules   the so-called TT-Seq (transient transcriptome sequencing) method. The results are reported in the latest issue of the renowned scientific journal Science on June 3rd. In order to catch the RNA molecules, the three junior researchers used a trick: They supplied cells with a molecule acting as a kind of anchor for a couple of minutes. The cells subsequently incorporated the anchor into each RNA they made during the course of the experiment. With the help of the anchor, the scientists were eventually able to fish the short-lived RNA molecules out of the cell and examine them..  The RNA molecules we caught with the TT-Seq method provide a snapshot of all DNA regions that were active in the cell at a certain time   the genes as well as the regulatory regions between genes that were so hard to find until now,  Cramer explains.  With TT-Seq we now have a suitable tool to learn more about how genes are controlled in different cell types and how gene regulatory programs work,  Gagneur adds. In many cases, researchers have a pretty good idea which genes play a role in a certain disease, but do not know which molecular switches are involved. The scientists around Cramer and Gagneur are hoping to be able to use the new method to uncover key mechanisms that play a role during the emergence or course of a disease. In a next step they want to apply their technique to blood cells to better understand the progress of a HIV infection in patients suffering from AIDS. ","Published: June 3, 2016"

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common, and one of the most severe types, of the disease. There are around 2,500 people in the UK living with DMD, which usually affects boys in early childhood and leads to progressively worsening disability and premature death. In DMD, the stem cells that normally repair damaged muscle are impaired, for reasons that remain unclear. In this new study, published in Scientific Reports, researchers looked at the molecular composition of the environment within which these muscle stem cells are found, to investigate whether this could be responsible for impaired function. Elevated protein levels Using a technique called proteomics to examine altered protein levels in muscle cells in mice, the team identified an enzyme protein called neutrophil elastase that was found to be more abundant in dystrophic muscle as compared to healthy muscle. Elastase breaks down several proteins found in the connective tissue that is present in various organs, including muscle. The enzyme is produced by white blood cells called neutrophils, which play an important role in inflammatory and immune responses and may be a key contributor to the development of muscular dystrophy. Under experimental conditions, the researchers then demonstrated that elevated levels of elastase dramatically reduce the survival and operation of muscle stem cells in culture. New treatments Lead researcher Dr Dada Pisconti, from the University s Institute of Integrative Biology, said:  Our findings evidence the importance of inflammation in muscular dystrophy, and suggest that elevated levels of elastase could play a key role in the progressive muscle degeneration seen in patients affected by DMD.  Although there is no cure for muscular dystrophy, improvements in treatments could help control symptoms to improve quality of life. Our next steps are to investigate whether drugs that target elastase are effective and safe as a potential therapy for this disease.

The discovery of this mutation should erase doubts that at least some forms of MS are inherited. The prevailing view has been that a combination of many genetic variations cause a slight increase in susceptibility. In the two families described in this study, two-thirds of the people with the mutation developed the disease.  This mutation puts these people at the edge of a cliff, but something still has to give them the push to set the disease process in motion,  said senior author Carles Vilarino-Guell, an assistant professor of medical genetics and a member of the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. Although only one in 1,000 MS patients appears to have this mutation, its discovery helps reveal the biological pathway that leads to the rapidly progressive form of the disease, accounting for about 15 per cent of people with MS. The discovery could also provide insight into the more common, fluctuating form of MS, known as  relapsing-remitting,  because in most cases, that disease gradually becomes progressive. The findings, published today in the journal Neuron, could help in the search for therapies that act upon the gene itself or counteract the mutation s disease-causing effects. More immediately, screening for the mutation in high-risk individuals could enable earlier diagnosis and treatment before symptoms appear.  If you have this gene, chances are you will develop MS and rapidly deteriorate,  said co-author Dr. Anthony Traboulsee, the MS Society of Canada Research Chair at UBC and Director of Vancouver Coastal Health s MS and Neuromyelitis Optica Clinic.  This could give us a critical early window of opportunity to throw everything at the disease, to try to stop it or slow it. Until now, we didn t have much basis for doing that.  Background on MS and this discovery: Signal disruption: Multiple sclerosis results from the body s immune system attacking myelin, the fatty material that insulates neurons and enables rapid transmission of electrical signals. When myelin is damaged, communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted, leading to vision problems, muscle weakness, difficulty with balance and coordination, and cognitive impairments. Canada has one of the highest rate of MS in the world, for reasons that elude scientists. An estimated 100,000 Canadians are living with MS, and the disease is most often diagnosed in young adults, aged 15 to 40. Defective protein: The MS-causing mutation discovered by UBC scientists was found on a gene called NR1H3. That gene produces a protein known as LXRA, which acts as an on-off switch on other genes. Some of those other genes stop the excessive inflammation that damages myelin or help create new myelin to repair the damage. A team led by Weihong Song, professor of psychiatry at UBC and the study s other senior author, found that the mutation of that gene   a substitution of just one nucleotide for another in the DNA   produces a defective LXRA protein that is unable to activate those other critical genes. Early intervention: People with a family history of MS could be screened for this mutation, and if they carry it, could be candidates for early diagnostic imaging long before symptoms appear; or they could opt to increase their intake of Vitamin D (low levels of which have been associated with the disease). If someone diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS were found to have this mutation, they might be candidates for earlier, more aggressive treatment to delay the onset of the progressive form of the disease. A more realistic animal model: Vilarino-Guell and his collaborators are now awaiting delivery of the first mice to be genetically engineered with this mutation, enabling examination of the cascade of reactions that leads to MS. Currently, scientists simulate MS in mice by either injecting them with myelin, which triggers an immune response, or by feeding them a drug that destroys myelin directly. Neither one mimics how the disease originates in humans. Thousands of samples: The families with this mutation had donated to a Canadian-wide collection of blood samples from people with MS, begun in 1993 by co-author A. Dessa Sadovnick, a UBC professor of medical genetics and neurology. The 20-year project, funded by the MS Society of Canada and the Multiple Sclerosis Scientific Research Foundation, has samples from 4,400 people with MS, plus 8,600 blood relatives   one of the largest such biobanks in the world.","Published: June 3, 2016"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cirrhosiscausing-cells-converted-to-healthy-liver-cells-in-mice-190641,Cirrhosis Causing Cells Converted to Healthy Liver Cells in Mice New approach that repairs liver from within may be more efficient than cell transplants  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Advances in stem cell research have made it possible to convert patients  skin cells into heart cells, kidney cells, liver cells and more in the lab dish, giving researchers hope that one day such cells could replace organ transplantation for patients with organ failure. But successfully grafting these cells into patients  failing organs remains a major clinical challenge. Now a team of researchers led by UC San Francisco scientists has demonstrated in mice that it is possible to generate healthy new liver cells within the organ itself, making engraftment unnecessary. What s more, they did it by converting the very cells that drive liver disease, thereby reducing liver damage and improving liver function at the same time. The technique takes advantage of a viral gene delivery technology that has gone through early validation in patients for liver-directed gene therapies, suggesting it could be readily translated into a therapy for patients with liver disease, said Holger Willenbring, MD, PhD, a professor of surgery at UCSF and senior author of the new study, published June 2, 2016, in the journal Cell Stem Cell.  Part of why this works is that the liver is a naturally regenerative organ, so it can deal with new cells very well. What we see is that the converted cells are not only functionally integrated in the liver tissue, but also divide and expand, leading to patches of new liver tissue,  said Willenbring, who is also associate director of the Liver Center at UCSF and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research. Targeting Liver Fibrosis More than 600,000 patients in the United States alone suffer from end-stage liver disease, or cirrhosis. The only available cure is liver transplantation, but the shortage of donor livers means only 6,000 patients benefit from this therapy each year in the U.S., and more than 35,000 patients die. The new approach specifically targets liver fibrosis, the progressive scarring of the liver that is a primary driver of liver disease. Fibrosis develops when liver cells called hepatocytes can t regenerate fast enough to keep up with damage caused by toxins such as alcohol or diseases such as hepatitis C or fatty liver disease. Cells called myofibroblasts fill in gaps left by dying hepatocytes with scar-like fibrotic tissue. It s a bit like patching a flat tire: at first the patches help maintain the liver s structural integrity, but eventually a liver that is more patches than functional tissue starts to fail. Fibrotic liver disease has a slow fuse, but leads to catastrophic failure: someone who contracts hepatitis C at age 25 may feel just fine for decades, then suddenly at age 50 start experiencing the fatigue, faintness, nausea, bruising, diarrhea and jaundice that indicate the onset of end-stage liver disease. The reason is that the liver can adapt as long as at least 20 percent of it is functional, Willenbring says, but once it dips below that critical threshold, patients are often dead within two years.  Liver fibrosis is not rare,  Willenbring said.  It s actually the end stage of many chronic liver diseases. Obesity, for instance, can lead to fatty liver disease, which is predicted to become the number one cause of liver fibrosis in the next 10 years.  Technique Reduces Liver Damage, Increases Function Willenbring has dedicated his career to using stem cell biology to generate new hepatocytes (originally using human embryonic stem cells and later using induced pluripotent stem cells that could be generated from a patient s own skin cells) that could be used in place of transplants to treat liver failure. Ironically, however, just as he and his lab have come closer to achieving this dream, Willenbring has had to grapple with the realization that this cell therapy approach may fail to reach the majority of patients with liver failure because the tangle of fibrosis itself impairs the successful engraftment of transplanted cells. So over the past five years, Willenbring and his team   in close collaboration with the laboratory of Dirk Grimm, PhD at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany   have embarked on a different approach: converting fibrosis-causing myofibroblasts into healthy new hepatocytes within the liver itself. Previous research had identified a cocktail of gene-regulating proteins that can convert other cell types into hepatocytes, but the team needed a way to deliver these instructions to myofibroblasts. After several years of work, the team identified a subtype of adeno-associated virus (AAV) that could specifically infect myofibroblasts. The researchers focused on AAV because it has been shown to be safe and effective in early human gene therapy trials, e.g., for therapy of the bleeding disorder hemophilia B. The team showed in mice with liver disease that viruses packed with the cell fate-changing cocktail indeed infected myofibroblasts and converted them into functional hepatocytes. The number of new cells was relatively small   less than one percent of all hepatocytes in the treated mice   but this was sufficient to reduce fibrosis and improve liver function. The viral approach was also effective in converting human myofibroblasts in a dish into working hepatocytes, but more work is certainly needed to prepare this approach for use in human patients, the researchers say. In particular, the lab is working to package the treatment into a single virus, reducing potential side effects and streamlining clinical development. The team is also working to make the viruses more specific to myofibroblasts   in the current paper muscle cells and some cells of the immune system were also infected, though without converting them into liver cells or obviously impacting their function. The new results suggest that in the fibrotic liver this approach could produce a more efficient and stable improvement of liver function than cell transplant approaches, Willenbring said, adding that once the viral packaging is optimized, such a treatment could be done cheaply at a broad range of medical facilities, not just in the specialized research hospitals where stem-cell transplants could be conducted. Willenbring is the first to acknowledge that the new technique is not a replacement for the current standard of care in liver disease:  A liver transplant is still the best cure,  Willenbring said.  This is more of a patch. But if it can boost liver function by just a couple percent, that can hopefully keep patients  liver function over that critical threshold, and that could translate to decades more of life.

The findings suggest that the higher risk of death from strokes in blacks is due mostly to the higher incidence in this population, and not to worse outcomes following stroke. The REGARDS study was funded by the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the results appear in the journal Stroke. There has been a decline of almost 70 percent in stroke mortality rates overall in the past 50 years, making stroke the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. The reduction is attributed to improved stroke prevention due largely to better control of stroke risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, smoking cessation, and advances in post-stroke care. However, despite the national trends showing declining stroke incidence and mortality, data from the REGARDS study confirm persistence of disparities between blacks and whites in the occurrence of stroke and mortality due to stroke. The difference in stroke incidence is believed to be due in part to differences in the prevalence of such potent risk factors as hypertension and diabetes, which are more common in blacks. However, the magnitude of the disparity in stroke mortality diminishes as the population ages, with no difference in the stroke mortality rate for those age 85 and older. The study authors say that the key to reducing the disparity in stroke incidence and mortality is increased efforts in stroke prevention, particularly control of high blood pressure and diabetes, which affect blacks disproportionately.  The prevalence of hypertension is higher in blacks, but its impact is even greater in the black population. An increase of 10mmHg in blood pressure is associated with an 8 percent increase in stroke risk among whites but a 24 percent increase in stroke risk in blacks,  said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of NINDS. Earlier this year, the NINDS launched a stroke prevention campaign called Mind Your Risks, designed to educate people aged 45-65 about the link between uncontrolled high blood pressure and the risk of developing dementia later in life. The campaign messaging launched in the Stroke Belt, an area of the southeastern U.S. where stroke incidence is high and REGARDS has focused its efforts.  This study shows that improved risk factor prevention and management is critical if we are going to reduce the apparent increased risk of stroke and stroke mortality in blacks,  said Claudia Moy, Ph.D., acting director of the Office of Clinical Research at NINDS, and one of the study authors. This work was supported by the NIH (NS041588). The NINDS is the nation s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.

The discovery could lead to the development of new treatments for the deadly disease. In a five-year study using human samples and mouse models, researchers led by Dr. Eri Srivatsan, a member of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, found that a protein known as cystatin E/M can inhibit cellular inflammation, which is a major contributor to the growth of cervical cancer. Typically, inflammation develops after a woman contracts the human papilloma virus from a male partner; the virus can eventually lead to the development of cervical cancer. Environmental factors such as smoking also are closely associated with the disease. The UCLA researchers discovered that cystatin E/M prevents a protein called NFkB, which regulates inflammation, from entering the nucleus of cervical cancer cells. As a result, decreased inflammation slows tumor cell growth.  When key inhibitory mechanisms break down, cancer cells produce inflammation that helps fuel cancer cell growth,  said Srivatsan, who is a professor in UCLA s department of surgery.  By identifying this protein, we have discovered a key regulator of this breakdown. This is the first time we have found that inhibition of the protein kinase by cystatin E/M plays a regulatory role in cell inflammation.  The study is published online in the journal Molecular and Cellular Biology. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women. In the United States, HPV is detected in 90 percent of cervical cancer tumors and is the most common sexually transmitted disease, Srivatsan said. Although cystatin E/M and its basic function had previously been identified, little else was known about the protein s molecular activity until 2008, when Srivatsan and colleagues  initial findings were published in Genes Chromosomes and Cancer. The new study built upon that research. Srivatsan s team analyzed 20,000 genes in two sets of cell lines   one set that expressed the cystatin E/M protein and the other that didn t. They also analyzed 66 samples of normal and cancerous cervical tissues to determine the molecular mechanism that inhibits cancer cell growth. In future research, Srivatsan s team will aim to determine whether cystatin E/M could inhibit tumor cell growth in chemo-radiation resistant breast cancers in human tissue culture and animal models. Dr. Neda Moatamed, a UCLA assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and a member of the Jonsson Cancer Center, was a co-author of the study. The research was supported by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.","Published: June 3, 2016"

A sheet of brain cells that folds in on itself multiple times in order to fit inside the skull, the cortex is the seat of higher functions. It is what enables us to process everything we see and hear and think. The expansion of the cerebral cortex sets humans apart from the rest of their fellow primates. Yet scientists have long wondered what mechanisms are responsible for this evolutionary development. Learn More: Intertwined evolution of human brain and brawn New research from the Kosik Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) has pinpointed a specific long nocoding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) that regulates neural development (ND). The findings appear in the journal Neuron. ""This lncND, as we've called it, can be found only in the branch of primates that leads to humans. It is a stretch of nucleotides that does not code a protein,"" said senior author Kenneth Kosik, the Harriman Professor of Neuroscience Research in UCSB's Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. ""We demonstrate that lncND is turned on during development and turned off when the cell matures."" Lead author Neha Rani, a postdoctoral scholar in the Kosik Lab, idenfitied several binding sites on lncND for another type of RNA called a microRNA. One of them, called microRNA-143, binds to lncND. ""We found that lncND could sequester this microRNA and in doing so regulate the expression of Notch proteins,"" Rani said. ""Notch proteins are very important regulators during neuronal development. They are involved in cell differentiation and cell fate and are critical in the neural development pathway."" Kosik describes lncND as a platform that binds these microRNAs like a sponge. ""This allows Notch to do what it's supposed to do during development,"" he explained. ""Then as the brain matures, levels of lncND go down and when they do, those microRNAs come flying off the platform and glom onto Notch to bring its levels down. You want Notch levels to be high while the brain is developing but not once maturation occurs. This lncND is an elegant way to change Notch levels quickly."" To replicate these cell culture results, Rani used human stem cells to grow neurons into what is called a mini brain. In this pea-sized gob of brain tissue, she identified a subpopulation radial glial cells (neuronal stem cells) and other neural progenitors responsible for making lncND. Don't Miss: Researchers map  switches  that shaped the evolution of the human brainBut the researchers wanted to see the radial glial cells in actual human brain tissue, so they turned to colleagues in the Developmental & Stem Cell Biology Graduate Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine. Using in situ hybridization, UCSF scientists found lncND in neural precursor cells but not in mature neurons. ""It was right where we thought it would be in brain tissue,"" said Kosik, who is also the co-director of UCSB's Neuroscience Research Institute. ""But we still had one more thing we had to do because people would still not be satisfied that we had done everything possible to show that lncND was really doing something functionally."" So the UCSF team introduced lncND into the fetal brain of a gestating mouse. Green fluorescent protein labeling allowed them to see the early development pattern and show that lncND, which ordinarily is not present in mice lncND is present only in some primates including humans had a functional effect on development. See Also: Powerful genetic regulator identified as risk factor for schizophrenia""When we overexpressed lncND in the mouse fetus, we actually affected development in the predicted manner,"" Kosik said. ""The early developmental pattern was shifted toward more precursor cells, even though the mouse does not make lncND at all."" According to Kosik, this work not only identifies a very critical gene for human brain development but also offers a clue about a component that likely contributed to brain expansion in humans. ""We have shown that lncND might be an important player in human brain expansion, which is exciting in itself,"" Rani said. ""Another interesting aspect of this work is that lncND appears to help regulate the key developmental pathway of Notch signaling."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

This biological molecule, called acetyl-CoA, is a major part of the process cells use to make energy from food. It's also used within cells to tag different proteins, which influences where and how they function. Local concentrations of acetyl-CoA and its movement, or flux, between different areas within cells is tightly regulated. See Also: Origins of  rage  identified in brain in male animal model ""We show, for the very first time, that changes in acetyl-CoA flux, and not just changes in its levels, in individual neurons can affect neuronal activity,"" says Luigi Puglielli, a professor in the Department of Medicine of the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health and the UW's Waisman Center. In the study, published in The Journal of Experimental Medicine, the researchers engineered mice to make the human version of a protein that ferries acetyl-CoA into a specific compartment within cells. Mouse models of ASD can help scientists understand the molecular basis of the disorder. Previous studies revealed that mutations in this ferrying protein, which is called AT-1, are associated with spastic paraplegia, severe developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder in humans. But how mutations in AT-1 are linked to these developmental disorders was unknown. The current study showed that changes in the amount of AT-1 in nerve cells can profoundly influence how much acetyl-CoA is found in different areas within those cells. When AT-1 levels are high, as is the case in the brains of the mice with the human AT-1 protein, increased movement of acetyl-CoA into specific areas within cells sets off a chain reaction of consequences that the researchers think ultimately leads to the mice showing autism-like behaviors. ""We could call AT-1 a 'master regulator' of intracellular acetyl-CoA flux, which, in turn, can be said to be a master regulator of essential neuronal functions,"" says Puglielli. In the brains of mice with human AT-1, atypical localization of acetyl-CoA in the nerve cells causes a slew of more than 400 genes to become dysregulated and pump out higher levels of proteins. Several of these proteins play important roles in regulating both the growth of neurons and how nerve impulses travel through them. The global changes in protein levels caused by manipulating these master regulators leads to significant changes in what nerve cells look like and how they function in these mice. For instance, the ends of the nerve cells become more branched and spiny and their ability to mediate typical learning and memory formation is compromised. Puglielli and his colleagues think these changes in how the nerve cells look and function ultimately caused the AT-1 mice to behave atypically, in ways that resemble aspects of ASD in humans. ""We need to be able to modify genetic, molecular and biochemical aspects of the disorder,"" says Puglielli. ""These sort of manipulations and studies cannot be performed in humans, hence the need to develop and study mouse models."" Learn More: Interactions between cortical and subcortical regions important in hypersensitivity in ASDWhile mouse models can provide vital information about human disorders, such as ASD, the researchers urge caution while interpreting findings. ""ASD is difficult to define in humans and there are different behaviors that we globally include under the umbrella of autism,"" says Puglielli. ""If it is difficult to define autism -- a human disorder -- in humans, you can imagine how much more difficult it is to define in mice."" Puglielli and his colleagues are now looking at other proteins that regulate acetyl-CoA movement within cells. ""Mutations in these proteins are also associated with different disorders, including ASD and intellectual disability,"" he says. ""A comprehensive analysis of the functions of these proteins will help us dissect more aspects of how acetyl-CoA flux is relevant to ASD.""

Researchers from KU Leuven (Kulak Kortrijk Campus) have now developed a new and quicker way to check whether the cocoa butter is crystallising correctly during the hardening process.  The crystallisation of the cocoa butter   the fat in the chocolate   plays an important role in the sound when you break it, how it melts in your mouth, and ensuring that the chocolate maintains all these qualities throughout its entire shelf life, is not easy.  Professor Imogen Foubert from the KU Leuven Department of Microbial and Molecular Systems explains:  Cocoa butter crystallises as the liquid chocolate hardens. Five types of crystals can be formed during this process, but only one of these has the qualities we want. The number, size, shape, and the way in which the crystals stick together play an important role as well.  It is therefore crucial to monitor the crystallisation of the cocoa butter closely during the chocolate production process, because we don t want inferior chocolate ending up on shop shelves.  We ve discovered that we can detect differences in the crystallisation of cocoa butter with ultrasonic waves,  adds Professor Koen Van Den Abeele from the KU Leuven Department of Physics and Astronomy. The new technique involves sending transversal ultrasonic waves through the cocoa butter. The researchers then measure the reflection of these waves for information about the structure of the butter. The technique is similar to the ultrasound echography used to monitor the health and growth of foetuses in the womb.  When the cocoa butter is liquid, the ultrasonic wave is reflected in its entirety. As soon as the butter crystallises, part of the sound wave penetrates the cocoa butter, so the amount of reflection we measure changes. This enables us to see how the different crystals stick together, which is important for the ultimate properties of the chocolate.  Chocolate manufacturers currently check the quality of their chocolate  offline . A sample is taken from the production line to be analysed in a lab. This method is very time-consuming, making it impossible to intervene quickly when something is wrong. As a result, a large amount of chocolate is destroyed or re-processed   a costly affair. The novel technique can be used  online  to check the chocolate while it s still on the production line. The researchers designed a lab prototype, which now needs to be turned into a prototype for use in real chocolate production lines. The current results were obtained with cocoa butter and need to be confirmed for actual chocolate.  The findings are the result of Annelien Rigolle s interdisciplinary doctoral research, supervised by Professor Imogen Foubert , who specialises in fat crystallisation, and Professor Koen Van Den Abeele, who s an expert in the use of ultrasound for non-destructive testing of materials such as composites, metals, and concrete.","Published: June 2, 2016"

Compared to the prototype, one of the new candidate drugs, called ""16-8,"" worked 10 times more effectively in cells with active TRPV4 that are key for the development of osteoarthritis. It also worked well in another cell type involved in nerve cell injury, stroke and epilepsy. But to their surprise, when assessing the specificity of 16-8, the scientists discovered that it also blocked TRPA1, which is a promising target in pain and itch research. ""As a physician, I soon realized the enormous potential that these compounds might have, given how beneficial dual-target molecules can be in clinical medicine,"" Liedtke said. Both TRPV4 and TRPA1 are members of the family of TRP ion channels, which function in sensory nerve cells to directly sense painful stimuli. Other research groups are now targeting these channels in clinical trials for pain relief. In this study, the drug 16-8 also quelled pain in living animals, including abdominal aches in mice with pancreas inflammation. So-called pancreatitis is extremely painful and difficult to treat, and new cases are on the rise globally, said study co-author Rodger Liddle, MD, of the Duke University School of Medicine and a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences.

Scientists say testing memory over a long timescale reveals early deficits in the brain's ability to remember. These are not detected by checks for short-term forgetfulness, which is the current practice for diagnosis. The study also suggests that a brain scan in combination with a memory test could identify early abnormalities in the brain activity of Alzheimer's patients that would be otherwise undetected. Researchers say that the type of memory loss revealed by such tests could potentially be reversed by the development of new treatments. See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression A team at the University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with colleagues in the US, studied long-term memory in young mice, some of which had the equivalent of very early stage Alzheimer's disease, and some of which were healthy. Scientists taught both groups of mice to locate a hidden platform in a pool filled with water, using signs on the wall of the room to navigate. The results showed that when tested shortly after the initial task, both groups of mice were able to remember the way to the platform. However, when tested one week later, the mice in the Alzheimer's group had significantly more difficulty in remembering the route. Tests revealed that brain activity was normal in both groups of mice at this young age, when no task was involved. However, the brain activity in the Alzheimer's group was significantly decreased compared with the healthy mice when tested as they tried to remember the way to the platform. Scientists say the results show that when short-term memory is used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease as is currently the case it may not reveal the true extent of memory loss at the onset of the condition. The team says that by testing long-term memory, it may be possible to detect the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease and offer interventions sooner. Professor Richard Morris, who led the research at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""We recognize that tests with animals must be interpreted with caution, but the use of these genetic models in conjunction with appropriate testing is pointing at an important dimension of early diagnosis.""

Their findings, published in the journal Science Advances, may assist in the development of novel receptor-based therapeutics for mutations that lead to certain types of hypocalcemia and neonatal hyperparathyroidism, in addition to Alzheimer s disease and some cancers. Calcium is abundant in the human body and participates in nearly every vital process. CaSR plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium concentration in the human body. However, the molecular basis underlying how CaSR regulates such important cell function has been unclear.  In this study, we reported the first crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the human CaSR, which enables us to visualize a large number of residues involved in disease-associated mutations,  said Jenny Yang, lead author on the paper, Distinguished University Professor and associate director of the Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics at Georgia State. Nearly 200 mutations and 15 polymorphisms associated with a variety of human disorders have been found in CaSR. In this study, researchers were able to map the mutations on the high-resolution CaSR structure. High-resolution structures of the CaSR are essential to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism in its regulated physiological functions as well as pathological activities.  Further uncovering of the structural and functional mysteries of the calcium-sensing receptor could aid in the the development of novel receptor-based therapeutics for use in the treatment of many different diseases,  Yang said.  It is quite interesting that an unexpected small molecule occupies the native ligand binding site and functions as a high-affinity co-activator, which suggests that it may serve as a lead compound for CaSR regulators,  said Jian Hu, paper co-author and assistant professor at Michigan State University. The researchers  discoveries lay the groundwork for the development of agonists and antagonists as potential therapies for human diseases related to the CaSR.

But traditional terahertz spectroscopy requires a radiation source that s heavy and about the size of a large suitcase, and it takes 15 to 30 minutes to analyze a single sample, rendering it impractical for most applications. In the latest issue of the journal Optica, researchers from MIT s Research Laboratory of Electronics and their colleagues present a new terahertz spectroscopy system that uses a quantum cascade laser, a source of terahertz radiation that s the size of a computer chip. The system can extract a material s spectroscopic signature in just 100 microseconds. The device is so efficient because it emits terahertz radiation in what s known as a  frequency comb,  meaning a range of frequencies that are perfectly evenly spaced.  With this work, we answer the question,  What is the real application of quantum-cascade laser frequency combs?  says Yang Yang, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the new paper.  Terahertz is such a unique region that spectroscopy is probably the best application. And QCL-based frequency combs are a great candidate for spectroscopy.  Different materials absorb different frequencies of terahertz radiation to different degrees, giving each of them a unique terahertz-absorption profile. Traditionally, however, terahertz spectroscopy has required measuring a material s response to each frequency separately, a process that involves mechanically readjusting the spectroscopic apparatus. That s why the method has been so time consuming. Because the frequencies in a frequency comb are evenly spaced, however, it s possible to mathematically reconstruct a material s absorption fingerprint from just a few measurements, without any mechanical adjustments. Getting even The trick is evening out the spacing in the comb. Quantum cascade lasers, like all electrically powered lasers, bounce electromagnetic radiation back and forth through a  gain medium  until the radiation has enough energy to escape. They emit radiation at multiple frequencies that are determined by the length of the gain medium. But those frequencies are also dependent on the medium s refractive index, which describes the speed at which electromagnetic radiation passes through it. And the refractive index varies for different frequencies, so the gaps between frequencies in the comb vary, too. To even out their lasers  frequencies, the MIT researchers and their colleagues use an oddly shaped gain medium, with regular, symmetrical indentations in its sides that alter the medium s refractive index and restore uniformity to the distribution of the emitted frequencies. Yang; his advisor, Qing Hu, the Distinguished Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; and first author David Burghoff, who received his PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT in 2014 and is now a research scientist in Hu s group, reported this design in Nature Photonics in 2014. But while their first prototype demonstrated the design s feasibility, it in fact emitted two frequency combs, clustered around two different central frequencies, with a gap between them, which made it less than ideal for spectroscopy. In the new work, Yang and Burghoff, who are joint first authors; Hu; Darren Hayton and Jian-Rong Gao of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research; and John Reno of Sandia National Laboratories developed a new gain medium that produces a single, unbroken frequency comb. Like the previous gain medium, the new one consists of hundreds of alternating layers of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide, with different but precisely calibrated thicknesses. Getting practical As a proof of concept, the researchers used their system to measure the spectral signature of not a chemical sample but an optical device called an etalon, made from a wafer of gallium arsenide, whose spectral properties could be calculated theoretically in advance, providing a clear standard of comparison. The new system s measurements were a very good fit for the etalon s terahertz-transmission profile, suggesting that it could be useful for detecting chemicals. Although terahertz quantum cascade lasers are of chip scale, they need to be cooled to very low temperatures, so they require refrigerated housings that can be inconveniently bulky. Hu s group continues to work on the design of increasingly high-temperature quantum cascade lasers, but in the new paper, Yang and his colleagues demonstrated that they could extract a reliable spectroscopic signature from a target using only very short bursts of terahertz radiation. That could make terahertz spectroscopy practical even at low temperatures.  We used to consume 10 watts, but my laser turns on only 1 percent of the time, which significantly reduces the refrigeration constraints,  Yang explains.  So we can use compact-sized cooling.   This paper is a breakthrough, because these kinds of sources were not available in terahertz,  says Gerard Wysocki, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Princeton University.  Qing Hu is the first to actually present terahertz frequency combs that are semiconductor devices, all integrated, which promise very compact broadband terahertz spectrometers.   Because they used these very inventive phase correction techniques, they have demonstrated that even with pulsed sources you can extract data that is reasonably high resolution already,  Wysocki continues.  That s a technique that they are pioneering, and this is a great first step toward chemical sensing in the terahertz region. ","Published: June 1, 2016"

The body uses proteins to build and repair tissues, make reactions happen, signal and control processes, and as hormones and antibodies.  They are the little machines inside cells,  UC Merced bioengineering Professor Victor Mu oz said.  They pretty much do everything.  Thanks to Mu oz and his research colleagues, those instructions are becoming clearer because for the first time, researchers can watch the intricacies of the process by which proteins self-assemble into their functioning states. In their new paper    A Simple Two-State Protein Unfolds Mechanically via Multiple Heterogeneous Pathways at Single-Molecule Resolution,  published this week in Nature Communications   Mu oz and his colleagues detail how they are beginning to illuminate a mysterious natural process that, if controllable, could lead to breakthrough treatments for diseases, among many other applications. Each protein is a unique string of amino acid chains encoded with DNA that dictates its mission. But each protein has to achieve its proper 3-D shape to fulfill its destiny. Scientists don t know how proteins fold, or why they sometimes misfold. Folding is hard to catch because it happens rarely and instantaneously.  Waiting for proteins to fold is like watching soccer   nothing seems to happen for a long time, then, suddenly, you blink and miss the goal being scored,  Mu oz said.  We know that when a protein folds it must follow a complex series of steps, like assembling a car in a production line. The problem is that when the protein actually folds, all the steps happen almost at the same time, and their order changes every time.  The new paper outlines Mu oz s sophisticated biophysics experiments, including attaching protein molecules to a tiny cantilever, then pulling on the molecules using force-spectroscopy. A better, higher-resolution method allows the researchers to actually see the steps in the process. Mu oz and his colleagues are also running parallel computer simulations to confirm and replicate the folding patterns, which is important because proteins can evolve stochastically   with a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically, but may not be predicted precisely.  These combined methods are unique tools for dissecting the mechanical unfolding mechanisms of proteins,  the professor said.  If we could control the folding of proteins, we could do so many things better. We could treat diseases without harsh chemicals. We could engineer designer cells that kill cancer, for example.  The protein work is related to one of three focus areas of UC Merced s new CREST Center for Cellular and Biomolecular Machines, co-led by Mu oz. The center brings together more than a dozen faculty members from across campus, including bioengineering, physics, chemistry and chemical biology, materials science, and engineering. Funded by a $5 million grant from the National Science Foundation s Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program, the center includes researchers who are studying how biological matter like proteins or cells come together to perform specific tasks. The work could help scientists design and develop innovations ranging from designer cells and tissue to novel diagnostic and therapeutic devices. It also dovetails with the work Mu oz is doing through the prestigious $1 million Keck Award he won earlier this year.","Published: June 1, 2016"

In a study published in eLife, the researchers found that both salicylic acid and diflunisal suppress two key proteins that help control gene expression throughout the body. These sister proteins, p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), are epigenetic regulators that control the levels of proteins that cause inflammation or are involved in cell growth. By inhibiting p300 and CBP, salicylic acid and diflunisal block the activation of these proteins and prevent cellular damage caused by inflammation. This study provides the first concrete demonstration that both p300 and CBP can be targeted by drugs and may have important clinical implications.  Salicylic acid is one of the oldest drugs on the planet, dating back to the Egyptians and the Greeks, but we re still discovering new things about it,  said senior author Eric Verdin, MD, associate director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology.  Uncovering this pathway of inflammation that salicylic acid acts upon opens up a host of new clinical possibilities for these drugs.  Earlier research conducted in the laboratory of co-author Stephen D. Nimer, MD, director of Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and a collaborator of Verdin s, established a link between p300 and the leukemia-promoting protein AML1-ETO. In the current study, scientists at Gladstone and Sylvester worked together to test whether suppressing p300 with diflunisal would suppress leukemia growth in mice. As predicted, diflunisal stopped cancer progression and shrunk the tumors in the mouse model of leukemia.  The ability to repurpose drugs that are already FDA-approved to be part of novel therapies for cancer patients is incredibly exciting,  said Nimer.  We have conducted a clinical trial of salicylic acid in patients with hematologic cancers and found it to be safe. Thus, this collaborative effort to develop novel epigenetic therapies is an important next step in our journey to find more effective treatment for leukemia patients.  The scientists are now pursuing a clinical trial that will test the ability of salicylic acid to treat patients with leukemia as part of novel combination therapies. Other possible clinical applications for salicylic acid include other forms of cancer, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory diseases, and even neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer s disease. Prior Gladstone research showed that another drug containing salicylic acid prevented the accumulation of tau in neurons and protected against cognitive decline in a mouse model of dementia.","Published: June 1, 2016"

Prevention strategies based on risk prediction are now a top public health priority, and there is great interest in developing new biomarkers of cardiovascular risk that allow a more accurate risk predication than classical risk factors such as high cholesterol, smoking, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure. One possible biomarker is telomere length, but a new study suggests that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in circulating blood does not effectively predict CVD risk in individuals without disease symptoms. The results of the study, conducted at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) and led by Drs. Valent n Fuster and Vicente Andr s, are published in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). Despite the lack of an association, Dr. Andr s, an investigator in the Instituto de Salud Carlos III Cardiovascular Research Network, emphasizes the need to interpret these results with caution.  These results are rather like taking a snapshot at a single point in a person s lifetime, and we still need to determine if atherosclerosis progresses faster in people who start with shorter leukocyte telomeres, have a higher proportion of very short telomeres, or in whom telomeres shorten at a faster rate during the aging process.  But Dr. Andr s also emphasizes that  we expect these important questions to be answered during the follow-up investigation planned for the participants in this subproject of the PESA study.  Telomeres are complex structures located at the ends of chromosomes, whose function is to maintain genomic stability and cell viability. Numerous studies have demonstrated that telomere DNA shortens progressively as we age, leading to genomic instability and eventually cell death, especially when the telomeres become  critically  short. Telomere DNA shortening has come to be viewed as a marker not only of aging, but also of an individual s general state of health, and this has generated great interest in the possibility that telomere length in circulating white blood cells might predict the risk of CVD. This idea is supported by epidemiological studies demonstrating shorter LTL in patients suffering coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. However, the results obtained to date are inconclusive, especially in relation to subclinical atherosclerosis. Moreover, there is a lack of information about the possible association of CVD with a high proportion of very short telomeres. Classical risk factors An estimated half of CVD patients do not have a high risk profile based on classical risk factors such as high cholesterol, smoking, lack of exercise, and high blood pressure. Moreover, many individuals who score high for these risk factors do not develop the disease. There is therefore a clear need to find new biomarkers to enable the early identification of individuals who do not yet show disease symptoms but are at high risk of developing atherosclerosis and suffering a heart attack or stroke. Experts believe that this would allow the implementation of appropriate preventative strategies in individuals at high risk, improving quality of life and reducing the health care and societal costs linked to CVD. The new study published in JACC included 1459 volunteers participating in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) clinical trial. In the study, the CNIC research team explored whether mean LTL and the proportion of critically short telomeres show an association with the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis (before the appearance of disease symptoms). The team analyzed the presence and extent of atherosclerosis in different vascular territories using noninvasive imaging techniques: 2D and 3D ultrasound in the carotid and iliofemoral arteries and the abdominal aorta, and computed tomography to quantify calcification in the coronary arteries. LTL was measured by researchers led by Dr. Mar a Blasco at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol gicas (CNIO), using the HT-QFISH technique. In line with previous studies, the results show an association between increasing age and a lower mean LTL and a higher proportion of short telomeres (defined arbitrarily as those measuring less than 3 kilobases). However, study authors Drs. Juan M. Fern ndez-Alvira and Beatriz Dorado point out that none of these parameters showed any association with the presence or extent of subclinical atherosclerosis in the PESA cohort.  Dr. Valent n Fuster, lead investigator on the PESA study, concludes that  the combination of noninvasive imaging techniques and HT-QFISH analysis has allowed us to conclusively evaluate whether telomere length in circulating leukocytes is a useful biomarker for identifying asymptomatic individuals at high risk of developing a cardiovascular disease in the future. Thanks to the PESA study,  adds Dr. Fuster,  we will now be in a position to determine if the rate of progressive telomere shortening can predict the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease.

In a study published in Molecular Pharmaceutics, a prestigious journal published by the American Chemical Society, scientists from Insilico Medicine in collaboration with Datalytic Solutions and Mind Research Network trained deep neural networks to predict the therapeutic use of large number of multiple drugs using gene expression data obtained from high-throughput experiments on human cell lines. Deep neural networks outperformed other machine learning techniques and did not result in significant drop in performance as the number of classes increased. When the networks got confused and guessed the therapeutic use of the drugs incorrectly, the drugs often had dual use, indicating the possibility of using DNNs for drug repurposing. This is the first known application of deep learning to drug discovery using transcriptional response data. In a recently accepted manuscript titled  Deep learning applications for predicting pharmacological properties of drugs and drug repurposing using transcriptomic data , scientists from Insilico Medicine, Inc located at the Emerging Technology Centers at Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with Datalytic Solutions and Mind Research Network presented a novel approach applying deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict pharmacologic properties of many drugs. In this study, scientists trained deep neural networks to predict the therapeutic use of a large number of drugs using gene expression data obtained from high-throughput experiments on human cell lines. Authors used a sophisticated approach of measuring the differential signaling pathway activation score for a large number of pathways to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining biological relevance and used these scores to train the deep neural networks.  The world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and affecting every aspect of our daily life. And soon this progress will be felt in the pharmaceutical industry. We set up the Pharma.AI division to help pharmaceutical companies significantly accelerate their R&D and increase the number of approved drugs, but in the process we came up with over 800 strong hypotheses in oncology, cardiovascular, metabolic and CNS space and started basic validation. We are cautious about making strong statements, but if this approach works, it will uberize the pharmaceutical industry and generate unprecedented number of QALY , said Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, CEO of Insilico Medicine, Inc. Despite the commercial orientation of the companies, the authors agreed not to file for intellectual property on these methods and to publish the proof of concept. Insilico Medicine is currently developing multimodal deep neural networks to predict a broad range of properties of drugs, small molecules and natural compounds for a range of applications including treating common and rare diseases, aging, regenerative medicine and increasing response rates in cancer immunotherapy.  The field of machine learning have recently witnessed an impressive breakthrough in the area of pattern recognition and computer vision. Deep learning, technology to thank for this, continues to disrupt traditional approaches in many other subfields of machine learning. Originally in the 60s, inspired by how the brain works (at least how we understood it back then) deep learning has now developed into a mature engineering concept. The brain however, does not cease to puzzle researchers and, I am sure, contains more sources of inspiration for the future powerful methodologies. , said Sergey Plis, PhD, Director of Machine Learning at the Mind Research Network and CEO of Datalytic Solutions. In this study scientists used the perturbation samples of 678 drugs across A549, MCF-7 and PC-3 cell lines from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived from MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) developed and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the NIH. To train the DNN, scientists utilized both gene level transcriptomic data and transcriptomic data processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm, for a pooled dataset of samples perturbed with different concentrations of the drug for 6 and 24 hours. Cross-validation experiments showed that DNNs achieve 54.6% accuracy in correctly predicting one out of 12 therapeutic classes for each drug. One peculiar finding of this experiment was that a large number of drugs misclassified by the DNNs had dual use, suggesting possible application of DNN confusion matrixes in drug repurposing. Earlier this month Insilico Medicine scientists published the first deep learned biomarker of human age aiming to predict the health status of the patient in a paper titled  Deep biomarkers of human aging: Application of deep neural networks to biomarker development  by Putin et al, in Aging and an overview of recent advances in deep learning in a paper titled  Applications of Deep Learning in Biomedicine  by Mamoshina et al, also in Molecular Pharmaceutics.  This study is a proof of concept that DNNs can be used to annotate drugs using transcriptional response signatures, but we took this concept to the next level.

A challenge that has been successfully met by a team from Inserm led by St phane Rocchi (Inserm Unit 1065,  Mediterranean Center for Molecular Medicine ), which has just synthesised and developed new drugs for melanoma. One of them, known as HA15, reduces the viability of melanoma cells without being toxic for normal cells.  Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. It affects melanocytes, the cells responsible for the synthesis of melanin, which gives the skin its colour. There are 3 stages of tumour progression: radial growth, in which the cells proliferate in a disordered manner in the epidermis, the vertical growth phase, which involves invasion of the dermis, and finally the metastatic phase, corresponding to the dissemination of the cancer cells in the peripheral tissues. Although encouraging results have been obtained for treating the metastatic phase (using targeted therapies or immunotherapies), most patients will need additional treatments to prevent the tumour from coming back, and to prevent more metastases from developing. The identification of new drug candidates is therefore an unavoidable element for the establishment of effective biotherapies against this cancer, the incidence of which is doubling every ten years. In this context, researchers from Nice discovered a new family of drugs, the Thiazole Benzensulfonamides (TZB), which have useful anticancer properties.  Initially this family of drugs was identified in type 2 diabetes, as it increased the sensitivity of cells to insulin. If we wanted to use it against cancer, we had to be able to eliminate this proinsulin activity,  explains St phane Rocchi.  Thus we started to modify its structure.  After many attempts, the initial TZD structure was extensively modified thanks to a fruitful collaboration with Dr Benhida s team from the Nice Institute of Chemistry, to obtain a formulation in which the  lead compound  was called HA15. In the mouse, this drug is highly effective in reducing the tumour volume without obvious toxicity in the rodent. In humans, in collaboration with the Dermatology Department in Nice University Hospital, the researchers showed that the drugs were active on melanoma cells from biopsies taken from patients who were sensitive or resistant to targeted therapies. Finally, HA15 is also effective on cell lines from other tumours such as cancer of the breast, colon, prostate, pancreas, and even gliomas and chronic myeloid leukaemias.  The ultimate goal of this project is to use these new drugs to treat melanoma, and more generally in other types of cancers,  concludes St phane Rocchi, who hopes to start a phase I clinical trial soon.","Published: June 1, 2016"

Cells rely on calcium as a key agent in several signalling pathways essential to our lives - muscle contraction, immune reactions, nerve function, light sensing and many other such processes. Calcium ions, however, cannot cross membranes directly, and must do so through specific protein channels that serve as 'gateways'. One class of these gateways are named 'Orai', after the mythological Greek Orai, also known as Horae or the gatekeepers of heaven. But what guards the guards, in this case the gatekeepers themselves? Latest research from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, gives us new insights into how Orai proteins are regulated. Researcher Bipan Kumar Deb from Gaiti Hasan's group has discovered that the protein Septin 7 guards Orai function by acting as a 'molecular brake' to Orai activation. Genetic experiments performed by Trayambak Pathak, also an author in the work, were followed up with molecular and cellular investigations by Deb, leading to this discovery, which has been published in the journal Nature Communications. Previous work from this group had established a critical role for calcium signalling and Orai in development of the flight circuit in Drosophila fly brains. During this investigation, Hasan's group showed the importance of Store Operated Calcium Entry or SOCE for dopamine biosynthesis in these neurons. SOCE is a process by which calcium ions slowly enter nerve cells to refill stores that have been depleted by cellular activity. Using this system as a platform, the team began further investigations into the ways by which calcium entry into cells is regulated. These studies led to the discovery of Septin 7 as a negative regulator of Orai in fly neurons. This means that if Septin 7 levels are decreased in a cell, calcium entry via Orai goes up, leading to higher calcium concentrations in the cell. This calcium entry was found to operate through a mechanism independent of depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. Further, the increased calcium entry due to lowering Septin 7 levels compensated for experimentally reduced SOCE in the Drosophila flight circuit. Importantly, this compensation did not occur when levels of both Septin 7 and Orai are lowered simultaneously. This underscores that Septin 7 acts primarily through Orai regulation. On the other hand, increasing the levels of Septin 7 by overexpression of the gene reduced SOCE in cells, adding further support to its role as a negative regulator of Orai function. In all, these experiments have discovered a role for Septin 7 as a key regulator of a membrane calcium channel that modulates calcium homeostasis in cells. Septins are a class of cytoskeletal proteins that are important for various functions such as cellular movement and cell division. ""Although several Septins are known to affect calcium signalling via Orai, all of these are positive regulators of Orai. This is one of the most interesting aspects of this work - Septin 7 is the first Septin shown to be a negative regulator of Orai and calcium signalling,"" says Gaiti Hasan. The negative nature of Orai regulation by Septin 7 could be a therapeutically important one. ""Most drugs work by inhibiting the function of a protein, and inhibiting most proteins causes the processes they are involved in to be reduced. In this case, inhibiting Septin 7 can actually raise intracellular calcium levels,"" says Bipan Kumar Deb, the lead author of the paper. ""In the context of neural function, we know that under some conditions, reduced calcium signalling can lead to neurodegeneration. Rare genetic disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxias are thought to be caused by dysregulation of calcium signalling. Future therapies for certain classes of such disorders could focus on Septin 7 as a therapeutic target,"" adds Gaiti Hasan. The next challenge the team intends to address involves studying the role of Septin 7 in Orai regulation in mammalian cells. Future work also involves studying how Septin 7 functions in cells other than neuronal cells, specifically, in cells of the immune system. ""The Orai gene was first discovered in patients with Severe Combined Immuno-Deficency (SCID) syndrome, and subsequently an essential role for Orai in immune cell function was uncovered,"" says Deb. ""Therefore, it is likely that Septin 7 may also play a role in calcium signalling mechanisms of the immune system, and we are already planning experiments to pursue this line of investigation,"" he adds with enthusiasm.","Published: June 1, 2016"

The finding helps explains why maternal smoking has been linked to behavioral changes such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, addiction and conduct disorder. Nicotine does this by affecting a master regulator of DNA packaging, which in turn influences activity of genes crucial to the formation and stabilization of synapses between brain cells, according to the study published online May 30 in the journal Nature Neuroscience.  When this regulator is induced in mice, they pay attention to a stimulus they should ignore,  said Marina Picciotto, the Charles B.G. Murphy Professor of Psychiatry, professor in the Child Study Center and the Departments of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, and senior author of the paper. An inability to focus is the hallmark of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other behavioral disorders, which have been linked to maternal smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke. However, scientists did not understand how early environmental exposure to smoking could create behavioral problems years later. Picciotto s lab found that mice exposed to nicotine during early development did indeed develop behavioral problems that mimic symptoms of attention deficit disorder in humans. They then did extensive genomic screening of mice exposed to nicotine and found higher levels of activity in a key regulator of histone methylation   a process that controls gene expression by changing the DNA wrapping around chromosomes. The researchers found that genes essential to the creation of brain synapses were heavily effected. Furthermore, the scientists found that these genetic changes were maintained even in adult mice. However, when researchers inhibited the master regulator of histone methylation, these adult mice were calmer and no longer reacted to a stimulus they should ignore. In a final test, they triggered expression of this regulator in mice never exposed to nicotine, and the mice exhibited behavior that mimicked attention deficit disorder.  It is exciting to find a signal that could explain the long-lasting effects of nicotine on brain cell structure and behavior,  Picciotto said.  It was even more intriguing to find a regulator of gene expression that responds to a stimulus like nicotine and may change synapse and brain activity during development. ","Published: June 1, 2016"

The resulting brain activity in young birds could shed light on speech learning and certain developmental disorders in humans, according to a study by McGill University researchers. See Also: Robot model for infant learning shows bodily posture may affect memory and learning Lead author Jon Sakata, a professor of neurobiology at McGill, says that songbirds learn vocalizations like humans learn speech. ""Songbirds first listen to and memorize the sound of adult songs and then undergo a period of vocal practice-in essence, babbling-to master the production of song."" Researchers have been studying song learning in birds for some time. But the degree to which social interaction with adult birds contributes to that learning has been unclear. That's because, unlike this current work, past studies didn't control for the time exposed to song and the presence of other birds. In this study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of juvenile zebra finches was allowed to interact with an adult. Another group simply heard adult songs played through a speaker. After a brief period of ""tutoring"" the juveniles were house individually for months as they practiced their tunes. Sakata and his team found that avian pupils who socialized with an adult learned the adult's song much better. That was true even if the social tutoring lasted just one day. In analyzing why this would be so, Sakata and his team made a surprising discovery. Adult zebra finches change their vocalizations when singing to juveniles. Sakata says just as people speak more slowly and repeat words more often when speaking to infants, so do these birds. ""We found that adult zebra finches similarly slow down their song by increasing the interval between song phrases and repeat individual song elements more often when singing to juveniles."" What's more, the researchers found that juvenile birds pay more attention to this ""baby talk"" compared to other songs. And the more the juveniles paid attention, the better they learned. The researchers took their work a step further by examining the activity of certain neurons in parts of the brain associated with attention. They found that more neurons that produce the chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine were turned on after socially interacting with a singing adult than after simply hearing song through a speaker. Learn More: Dopamine key to vocal learning, songbird study findsDr. Sakata says this finding could have implications beyond the avian world. ""Our data suggest that dysfunctions in these neurons could contribute to social and communicative disorders in humans. For example, children who suffer from autism spectrum disorders have difficulty processing social information and learning language, and these neurons might be potential targets for treating such disorders."" Dr. Sakata is now testing whether raising dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain can help birds learn song when they only hear adult songs. As he puts it, ""We are testing whether we can ""trick"" a bird's brain into thinking that the bird is being socially tutored."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The findings suggest these neurons, in a largely unstudied region of the brain, are deeply connected to the tendency to overindulge in response to external triggers, a problem faced by people addicted to food, alcohol and drugs. The findings appear online in Neuron.

""Our findings show where in the brain this connection between environmental stimuli and the seeking of food or drugs is occurring."" First researchers trained rats to realize that if they heard a certain sound, either a siren or staccato beeps, and a pushed a lever, they would get a drink of sugar water. Then, as the rats performed the task, researchers monitored neurons within the ventral pallidum area of the rats' brains, a subcortical structure near the base of the brain. When the rats heard the cue linked to their treat, a much larger-than-expected number of neurons reacted and vigorously, researchers found. They also found that when the neuron response was particularly robust, the rats were extra quick to go for the sugar. The researchers were able to predict how fast the rats would move for the sugar just by observing how excited the neurons became at the sound of the cue. ""We were surprised to see such a high number of neurons showing such a big increase in activity as soon as the sound played,"" Richard said. Neurons react to the cue for sugar during the experiment. Credit: JHU  Next, the researchers used optogenetics to temporarily suppress the activity of ventral pallidum neurons while the rats heard the sugar cues. With those neurons inactive, the rats were less likely to pull the sugar lever; when they did pull it, they were much slower to do so.

Among 0- to 17-year-olds who have a CHOP primary care physician and were diagnosed with a concussion within CHOP's regional pediatric network, 82 percent had their first concussion visit at a primary care site, 12 percent at the emergency department, 5 percent within specialty care (sports medicine, neurology, trauma), and 1 percent were directly admitted to the hospital. Many current counts of concussion injury among children are based solely on emergency department (ED) visits or on organized high school and college athletics data. Thus, the authors say, we may be vastly underestimating child and youth concussions in the US. See Also: Comprehensive concussion literature analysis lays foundation for evidence-based guidelines ""We learned two really important things about pediatric concussion healthcare practices,"" says Kristy Arbogast, PhD, lead author and Co-Scientific Director of CHOP's Center for Injury Research and Prevention. ""First, four in five of this diverse group of children were diagnosed at a primary care practice not the emergency department. Second, one-third were under age 12, and therefore represent an important part of the concussion population that is missed by existing surveillance systems that focus on high school athletes."" The study appears in JAMA Pediatrics. Using the CHOP electronic health record (EHR), researchers retrospectively analyzed more than 8,000 concussion diagnoses over a recent four-year period among children up to 17 years who receive their primary care within the CHOP network. Over the course of that period (July 2010 - June 2014), primary care visits as the point of entry increased 13 percent, with a corresponding 16 percent decrease in point-of-entry ED visits. ""This study provides direction for healthcare networks and clinicians about the critical importance of providing targeted training and resources in primary care settings,"" says Christina Master, MD, a co-author and pediatric sports medicine specialist at CHOP. ""With targeted training and support, pediatric primary care providers are well-positioned to diagnose and treat the vast majority of concussions."" Typically, compared to more specialized settings, a primary care practice can see injured patients sooner, thus getting them on the proper path for treatment earlier. Key to recovery from a concussion is early diagnosis and treatment including early cognitive and physical rest followed by a supervised return to learning and activity. The majority of concussions will resolve with this approach in two to three weeks. Patients with lingering symptoms or other comorbidities can be referred for specialist care. Don't Miss: Portable, low-cost optical imaging tool found to be useful in concussion evaluation ""We need surveillance that better captures concussions that occur in children and adolescents,"" says Debra Houry, MD, MPH, Director of CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.

CHOP researchers are working hard to fill in many gaps in knowledge about pediatric and adolescent concussions, according to Dr. Arbogast. ""We are utilizing the large and diverse electronic health record at CHOP to answer many questions about the natural history of pediatric concussion to guide advances critically needed in this field,"" says Dr. Arbogast.

Images predicting electric shocks were found to cause increased habenula activation in healthy volunteers, but decreased activation in depressed people.

We can only speculate as to how this deactivation is linked to symptoms, but it could be that this ancient part of the brain actually plays a protective role against depression. Animal experiments have shown that stimulating the habenula leads to avoidance, and it is possible that this occurs for mental as well as physical negative events. So one possible explanation is that the habenula may help us to avoid dwelling on unpleasant thoughts or memories, and when this is disrupted you get the excessive negative focus that is common in depression.""

The three-year study conducted by McLean researchers points to specific neuroanatomical changes in human subjects with these illnesses, and specifically to neurons that regulate anxiety and stress response, according to Harry Pantazopoulos, PhD, assistant neuroscientist at McLean's Translational Neuroscience Laboratory and instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. See Also: Deconstructing mental illness through ultradian rhythms ""For more than 50 years, there's been evidence that there's something wrong with circadian rhythms in people with bipolar disorder, but there has been a huge gap in terms of what we understand about their brains and how altered circadian rhythms are contributing to their symptoms,"" noted Pantazopoulos, lead author of the study. ""Growing evidence points to a key role for somatostatin, a neurotransmitter in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,"" he said. ""In the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in anxiety and stress, somatostatin plays an important role in the regulation of anxiety and depression, often co-occurring in these disorders."" The paper provides three main, previously unreported findings: This altered circadian function of somatostatin in subjects with bipolar disorder consists of a sharp decrease in somatostatin expression by neurons in the early morning, in comparison to a rise in the same neurons during this time interval in healthy control subjects, according to Pantazopoulos. ""We eventually saw that people with bipolar disorder have a very strong decrease of this protein in the beginning of the day while people without a psychiatric disorder normally have an increase in this protein,"" he said. ""The decrease of the protein correlates very strongly with the established severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in people with mood disorders, in the morning. Therefore, our findings point to potential neural correlates of circadian rhythm abnormalities associated with specific symptoms in bipolar disorder."" The study was conducted using postmortem brains from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, in which 15 brains were used from healthy controls, 15 with bipolar disorder, and 12 with schizophrenia. ""Brain imaging technology doesn't have the resolution at the moment to allow us to examine these neurons in the brain in people with bipolar disorder because the changes are in very specific neurocircuits that we can't visualize very well,"" said Pantazopoulos. ""With post mortem brain studies, we are able to look at changes microscopically.""

See Also: Main component of brain repair after stroke identified ""An implanted stimulation system for multi-joint control is a promising intervention to provide assistance to stroke survivors during daily walking,"" write Nathaniel Makowski, PhD, and colleagues of the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center. With technical refinements and further research, such implanted neuroprosthesis systems might help to promote walking ability for at least some patients with post-stroke disability. The researchers report their experience with an implanted neuroprosthesis in a 64-year-old man with impaired motion and sensation of his left leg and foot after a hemorrhagic stroke. After thorough evaluation, he underwent surgery to place an implanted pulse generator and intramuscular stimulating electrodes in seven muscles of the hip, knee, and ankle. Makowski and colleagues then created a customized electrical stimulation program to activate the muscles, with the goal of restoring a more natural gait pattern. The patient went through extensive training in the researchers' laboratory for several months after neuroprosthesis placement. In a 'before-and-after' study design, the patient showed significant gains in walking speed and distance. Gait speed increased from 0.29 meters per second (m/s) before surgery, to 0.35 m/s after training but without muscle stimulation--a nonsignificant improvement. But when muscle stimulation was turned on, gait speed increased dramatically: to 0.72 m/s. Detailed analysis of the patient's walking ability also showed evidence of a ""more symmetrical and dynamic gait."" In addition, the patient was able to walk much farther. When first evaluated, he could walk only 76 meters before becoming fatigued. After training but without stimulation, he could walk about 300 meters (in 16 minutes). With stimulation, the patient's maximum walking distance increased to more than 1,400 meters (in 41 minutes) with stimulation. ""Thus his walking distances increased by 370 percent with stimulation while walking nearly twice as fast,"" Makowski and colleagues write. Even though the patient wasn't walking with stimulation outside the laboratory, his walking ability in daily life improved significantly. He went from ""household-only"" ambulation to increased walking outside in the neighborhood. Learn More: Images of brain after mild stroke predict future risk ""The therapeutic effect is likely a result of muscle conditioning during stimulated exercise and gait training,"" according to the authors. ""Persistent use of the device during walking may provide ongoing training that maintains both muscle conditioning and cardiovascular health."" While the results of this initial experience in a single patient are encouraging, the researchers emphasize that large-scale studies will be needed to demonstrate the wider applicability of a neuroprosthesis for multi-joint control. If the benefits are confirmed, Makowski and colleagues conclude, ""Daily use of an implanted system could have significant clinical relevance to a portion of the stroke population.""

New research at The Rockefeller University shows that when mice experience prolonged stress, structural changes occur within a little-studied region of their amygdala, a part of the brain that regulates basic emotions, such as fear and anxiety. These changes are linked to behaviors associated with anxiety and depressive disorders There is good news, too: an experimental new drug might prevent these changes. See Also: Maturing brain flips function of amygdala in regulating stress hormones ""There have been hints that the amygdala displays a complex response to stress,"" says lead author Carla Nasca, a postdoc in Bruce S. McEwen's lab. ""When we took a closer look at three regions within it, we found that neurons within one, the medial amygdala, retract as a result of chronic stress. ""While this rewiring can contribute to disorders such as anxiety and depression, our experiments with mice showed that the neurological and behavioral effects of stress can be prevented with treatment by a promising potential antidepressant that acts rapidly,"" Nasca says. In the research, published in Molecular Psychiatry, her team found this protective approach increased resilience among mice most at risk for developing anxiety or depression-like behaviors. The brain's limbic system controls emotions and memory, and it comprises a number of structures, including the amygdala, which is found deep in the brain. Scientists interested in the neurological effects of stress have focused on several structures in the limbic system, but the medial amygdala has thus far received little attention in stress studies. To see what was going on in this area, as well as two other parts of the amygdala, Nasca and her team first subjected mice to 21 days of periodic confinement within a small space--an unpleasant experience for mice. Afterward, they tested the mice to see if their behaviors had changed--for instance, if they had begun to avoid social interaction and showed other signs of depression. They also analyzed the neurons of these mice within the three regions of the amygdala. Don't Miss: Study: Amygdala encodes 'cooties' and 'crushes' in the developing brainOne area saw no change with stress. In another, the basolateral amygdala, they saw that neurons' branches became longer and more complex a healthy sign of flexibility and adaptation, and something that had been shown up in previous work. But in the medial amygdala, they neuronal branches, which form crucial connections to other parts of the brain, appeared to shrink. The loss of connections like these can harm the brain, distorting its ability to adapt to new experiences, leaving it trapped in a state of anxiety or depression. This effect could be prevented. The scientists repeated the stress experiment, and this time they treated mice nearing the end of their 21 days of chronic stress with acetyl carnitine, a molecule Nasca is studying for its potential as a rapid-acting antidepressant. These mice fared better than their untreated counterparts; not only were they more sociable, the neurons of their medial amygdalas also showed more branching. Stress does not affect everyone the same way. This is true for both humans and mice some individuals are just more vulnerable. Nasca and her colleagues' experiments included mice at high risk of developing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in response to stress. Treatment with acetyl carnitine also appeared to protect these mice, suggesting that a similar preventative approach might work for depression-prone people. Learn More: Researchers stimulate human amygdala for first time; breathing loss recorded Both humans and rodents naturally produce acetyl carnitine under normal conditions and several depression-prone animal models are deficient in acetyl carnitine. In a separate study, Nasca and colleagues are examining whether people with depression have abnormally low levels of the molecule. ""Chronic stress is linked to a number of psychiatric conditions, and this research may offer some new insights on their pathology,"" McEwen says. ""It seems possible that the contrasting responses we see within the amygdala, and the limbic system in general, may contribute to these disorders' differing symptoms, which can range from avoiding social contact to experiencing vivid flashbacks.""

Executive Director Professor Michelle Haber AM of Children s Cancer Institute said that, as result of the commitment, the ground-breaking personalised medicine program for childhood cancer would take a giant step towards improving outcomes for children with the most difficult-to-treat cancers.  We are delighted by the funding commitment the Prime Minister has announced today  she said.  We hope all parties will support this announcement .  This funding is critical to build the research infrastructure we need to deliver the benefits that Zero Childhood Cancer will bring for children with the highest-risk cancers, wherever in Australia they are.  The Program, an initiative of Children s Cancer Institute and the Sydney Children s Hospital Network, involves the detailed laboratory analysis of each child s unique cancer cells, to help identify the drugs most likely to kill their specific cancer. Scientists and doctors will then work collaboratively to identify and deliver the most effective treatment plan, specifically tailored to suit each child s individual disease. Despite the dramatic increase in childhood cancer survival rates over the last sixty years, from virtually 0% to 80%, nearly three Australian children and adolescents still die each week of cancer and 950 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer each year in Australia. Seventy percent of childhood cancer survivors experience significant side effects from their treatment which may be lifelong. Professor Glenn Marshall AM, Director of the Kid s Cancer Centre at the Sydney Children s Hospital, Randwick and Head of Translational Research, Children s Cancer Institute says the network of clinical and research partners across Australia will be significantly boosted by the funding commitment announced today in Sydney.  This personalised medicine initiative is the epitome of research translated into clinical practice   true bench to bedside science. The Program is running a pilot study this year with a national clinical trial planned for next year. I am proud to support many of the families here in their battle against childhood cancer. This program holds out hope both to them and the families that come after them  he said.  Tailor-made treatment is expensive and we are lucky to have had wonderful support from partners like the Cancer Therapeutics CRC (CTx) and the NSW Government, both of whom came on board early with the program  said Professor Haber.  We wouldn t be able to run this Program without the support of partners including Australian Cancer Research Foundation, Cure Brain Cancer, The Kid s Cancer Project, the Rory Williams Fund, Kids Cancer Alliance, UNSW, the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Lions Club International Foundation, the Australian Lions Childhood Cancer Research Foundation and the Robert Connor Dawes Foundation.  This support from all our partners is invaluable. It has certainly meant we have made great progress but this is an ambitious, complex program with significant costs. We anticipate the total costs for the full national program to 2020 will be more than $50M which means every dollar, from the government for capital equipment and infrastructure matched with community support for scientists and consumables, is critical , she said.","Published: May 31, 2016"

The initiative, called Technologies for Host Resilience (THoR), will search for and identify examples of tolerance across several species through experiments with clinically-relevant pathogens, and will then develop a custom bioinformatics platform to reverse engineer and pinpoint multiple therapeutic targets that could one day be potentially used to induce tolerance in humans. Selected by DARPA to lead the initiative, the Wyss Institute has expertise in modeling systemic infection and sepsis in pigs (which in 2015 led to the development of a sepsis therapeutic device), an extremely large inventory of clinically-isolated pathogens numbering more than 200 in total, and unique organs-on-chips technology that enables in vitro analysis of human organ-level responses. Led by Principal Investigator (PI) and Wyss Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., and Co-PI and Wyss Senior Staff Scientist Michael Super, Ph.D., the THoR team aims to uncover new molecular information about infection tolerance that will enable development of novel therapeutics. ""There s been recent recognition of the desperate problem of emerging infections and the rise of antibiotic resistance,"" said Ingber, who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Children s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""Yet, at the same time,"" Ingber continued, ""there is always a subpopulation of individuals who become infected but never display significant symptoms. DARPA has provided us with support to uncover how this works, with the visionary goal of developing an entirely new class of resilience-inducing therapeutics that can make everyone tolerant of infection, regardless of whether it s multidrug resistant bacteria, influenza, or Ebola."" Often it s not the infections themselves, but the inflammatory cascade of symptoms they trigger that leads to life-threatening complications associated with infections such as sepsis, organ injury, and even death. The team envisions that THoR could lead to new therapeutics that could one day protect patients from developing symptoms stemming from many different kinds of infections, while also allowing them to more quickly clear pathogens from their bodies. ""It s such a new approach to fighting pathogen infection   something that s never been done before   and it s incredibly exciting to be leveraging our expertise in modeling sepsis infection to make new discoveries about how some individuals or species fare better than others in the face of infection, and then apply this knowledge to develop novel therapies,"" said Super. The THoR team will search across multiple species, including human, mouse, pig and frog, for tolerance-inducing biological mechanisms. To do so they will utilize organs-on-chips technology to compare how the microbiomes in human versus mouse guts influence tolerance to infection, and collect data using a pig infection model to identify and study tolerant individuals. Additionally, the team will develop the first-ever high-throughput screening method in frog embryos to screen for tolerance-inducing mechanisms. Frogs share common regulatory and immune systems with humans and other higher order organisms   because of this it's possible to screen through their embryos for a broad range of pathogens and thousands of potential therapeutic compounds much faster than using other experimental models. A predictive and unified analysis platform based on integrated bioinformatics algorithms and modeling approaches will be developed to crunch through the voluminous experimental data generated by the team. These efforts will be led by co-investigator and Wyss Core Faculty member James Collins, Ph.D., who is also the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Department of Biological Engineering. ""We intend to collect different kinds of high-throughput biomolecular data to identify the genetic and metabolic factors mediating tolerance in multiple higher organisms,"" said Collins. ""From these comparative analyses, we ultimately want to understand how tolerance arises in humans. Our integrated systems approach is centered around the notion that biological networks underlie the tolerant responses of higher organisms to infections."" In addition to Ingber, Super, and Collins, other collaborators playing key roles in THoR will include: Dennis Kasper, M.D., the William Ellery Channing Professor of Medicine at Brigham and Women s Hospital and Professor of Microbiology and Immunobiology at HMS, who will assist in characterizing tolerance in human and mouse gut-on-a-chip devices; Hu Li, Ph.D., Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at the Mayo Clinic s Center for Individualized Medicine, who will develop and apply systems biology and network approaches to identify underlying regulatory mechanisms of tolerance from THoR data; Zoran Obradovic, Ph.D., the Laura H.

Infectious diseases are one of the biggest killers in the world. Almost 5 million children under age 5 die each year from infectious diseases worldwide, yet many infections are treatable if the pathogen culprit can be quickly and accurately identified. In the realm of infectious diseases, this type of technology could be as significant as sequencing the human genome,says co-author Mark Yandell, PhD, professor of human genetics at the University of Utah (U of U), H.A.Edna Benning Presidential Endowed Chair holder, co-director of the USTAR Center for Genetic Discovery, and co-founder of IDbyDNA. Very few people have inherited genetic disease. But at some point, everyone gets sick from infections. It is difficult for infectious pathogens to hide when their genetic material is laid bare. Taxonomer opens up an entirely new approach for infectious disease diagnosis, driven by sophisticated genomic analysis and computational technologies. After a patient's sample is sequenced, the data are uploaded via the internet to Taxonomer. In less than one minute, the tool displays a thumbnail inventory of all pathogens in the sample, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The interactive, real-time user interface of Taxonomer is powered by the IOBIO system developed by the laboratory of Gabor Marth, DSc, professor of human genetics at the U of U and co-Director of the USTAR Center for Genetic Discovery. Our benchmark analyses show Taxonomer being ten to a hundred times faster than similar tools,says co-author Robert Schlaberg, MD, Dr Med, MPH, a medical director at ARUP Laboratories and cofounder of IDbyDNA. Schlaberg was awarded a $100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to apply Taxonomer toward decreasing high mortality rates of children with infectious diseases in resource-limited settings. Schlaberg points out that current diagnostic testing still relies heavily on growing cultures of suspected pathogens in the laboratory, which is often inconclusive and time consuming. Even with much faster tests like PCR, the number of pathogens that can be detected is limited. Schlaberg explains that Taxonomer can identify an infection without the physician having to decide what to test for, something a PCR-based test cannot do. In other words, a doctor doesn't have to suspect the cause of a patient's infection, but can instead simply ask, ""What does my patient have?"" and Taxonomer will identify the pathogens. In the new study, Taxonomer was put to the test with real-world cases using data published by others and samples provided by ARUP Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Taxonomer determined that some patients who exhibited Ebola-like symptoms in the recent African outbreak did not have Ebola but severe bacterial infections that likely caused their symptoms.  This technology can be applied whenever we don t know the cause of the disease, including the detection of sudden outbreaks of disease. It is very clear we urgently need more accurate diagnostics to greatly enhance the ability of public health response and clinical care,  says Seema Jain, MD, medical epidemiologist at the CDC. Another unique feature of Taxonomer is its ability to delve into human gene expression profiling, which provides information on how or if the patient s body is reacting to an infection.  As a clinician, this gives you a better idea, when we identify a pathogen whether it is really the cause of the disease,  says Carrie L. Byington, MD, professor of pediatrics of the U of U and co-director of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science.  This tool will also allow us to determine if the patient is responding to a bacterial or viral infection when we don t find a pathogen or when we find multiple potential causes.  She says that she sees the exceptional value of this tool for treating children, who experience more life-threatening infections early in life.  Seeing how a host [patient] reacts is extremely valuable; I believe this is a paradigm shift in how we diagnose people. It is why I wanted to be involved.  In a previous paper published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Schlaberg and his collaborators demonstrated that high-throughput sequencing in combination with Taxonomer can reliably detect pathogens, and identify previously missed pathogens, in patient samples.  Taxonomer provides a critical step forward, as it is extremely fast, accurate, and easy enough to use for implementation in diagnostic laboratories,  says Schlaberg.  ","Published: May 31, 2016"

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/faster-more-efficient-crispr-editing-194293,Faster  More Efficient CRISPR Editing  UC Berkeley scientists have developed a quicker and more efficient method to alter the genes of mice with CRISPR Cas   simplifying a procedure growing in popularity because of the ease of using the new gene editing tool  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. While CRISPR-Cas9 has drawn worldwide attention because of its potential to correct simple hereditary diseases in humans, basic researchers are excited about its ability to help them understand the causes and develop treatments for more complex diseases, including cancer and dementia. To do that, they need to knock out or modify specific genes in lab animals   in particular, mice   and see what goes awry. Today s gold standard for creating these  knockouts  or  knockins  is to edit the genes inside mouse embryonic stem cells, use these cells to create mosaic mice, and then crossbreed the mice to get a pure genetic strain. Because of CRISPR-Cas9 s ability to precisely alter or replace genes, the editing is increasingly being done directly in the fertilized egg, or early embryo. The new method, called CRISPR-EZ (CRISPR RNP electroporation of zygotes), makes genome editing in mouse embryos even easier.  The key fundamental insights about the biological significance of a gene usually come from in vivo gene-editing studies, in which you generate mice with an altered gene,  said lead researcher Lin He, a UC Berkeley associate professor of molecular and cell biology.  But it is a major committment to make a novel knockout with genome engineering. I think this technology could greatly reduce the technical barrier for this type of effort and will allow people to focus more on the science rather than be consumed by the process of genetically engineering mice.  The new method, described in a paper in press at the Journal of Biological Chemistry, gets around a time-consuming bottleneck in creating knockout mice: using microscopic needles to inject gene-editing molecules into a fertilized egg. The UC Berkeley researchers found that a simple lab technique called electroporation works much better, allowing them to insert CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing molecules into embryos with nearly 100 percent success. Electroporation uses a jolt of electricity to create holes in the embryos through which molecules can enter. Using CRISPR-EZ in a pilot experiment, He s team successfully disrupted both copies of a target gene in 88 percent of the mice. The procedure generated a much greater number of edited mice compared to CRISPR microinjection, largely due to a significant improvement in embryo viability. CRISPR-EZ is a simple and cost-effective methodology, and can be performed on many embryos at once and takes only miliseconds, He said.  In the not too distant past, it would cost at least $25,000 and take at least 6 months to make a knockout mouse,  said Russell Vance, a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and director of the Cancer Research Laboratory, where the transgenic mouse work was performed.  With CRISPR, and improvements such as CRISPR-EZ, the costs and time have both dropped at least 10-fold. These technical innovations make the mouse an even more powerful tool for modeling human diseases.  The UC Berkeley group is now working with several transgenic mouse facilities in hopes that they will adopt and improve this electroporation technique, which she suspects will also simplify the creation of other transgenic mammals. Knockouts require IVF team Creating transgenic mice requires a skilled in vitro fertilization team. Technicians use hormone injections to prepare the females for mating, after which they harvest the fertilized eggs and, before the eggs start to divide, inject them one at a time using a fine needle. Currently, technicians inject two RNA molecules   messenger RNA (mRNA), which codes for the Cas9 protein, and guide RNA, which provides the address for CRISPR-Cas9 s target   and hope that the mRNA is properly translated into Cas9 protein and that the protein correctly combines with guide RNA. The engineered embryos are implanted into a falsely pregnant mouse, where they gestate for about 20 days before birth. Given the inevitable embryo deaths during injection and the failure of the embryos to implant or go to term, the live-birth rate is low, He said.  The actual percentage of live births from injected embryos is around 10 to 15 percent for most transgenic facilities, which is a problem with the procedure,  she said.  Sometimes people collect more than 100 embryos just to generate one or two mice with desirable gene editing.  Electroporation appears to do less damage to the embryos than microinjection: between 30 and 50 percent of the embryos resulted in live births. Apparently, too, inserting pre-assembled CRISPR-Cas9 molecules into the fertilized egg is a more effective way to edit genes than injecting two molecules   the mRNA and guide RNA   and hoping that they properly self-assemble. Of the live births, 88 percent of the mice had both copies of the target gene edited   a higher success rate than usual for transgenic procedures, He said. For a more complex procedure   modifying a short DNA sequence within a gene   the method was successful 42 percent of the time in a pilot experiment.  With such a high success rate, you can use this to test your guide RNAs very quickly,  she said.  If your CRISPR-EZ doesn t work, it s not because of delivery; it s likely because your guide RNA design needs to be improved.  The high embryo viability and very high gene-editing efficiency mean researchers need to use fewer mice and can conduct several transgenic experiments simultaneously. Accidental discovery In her lab, He studies small bits of RNA called microRNA, which modify how DNA is transcribed and thus control important processes inside a cell. Some types of cancer have been linked to problems with miRNA. Looking for a simpler way to create transgenic mice to study these regulatory processes, postdoctoral fellow Andrew Modzelewski tested electroporation to see if he could get eggs to more easily take up the Cas9 mRNA and the guide RNA. Despite other researchers  apparent success with mRNA, his initial attempts were unsuccessful. One evening, finding himself out of mRNA and not wanting to waste the prepared embryos, he borrowed CRISPR-Cas9 protein from a neighboring lab, assembled RNP complexes and electoporated them instead.  It has worked like magic ever since,  He said.  You would never think that this would work, because Cas9 is a gigantic molecule. I was surprised that such a huge protein could be electroporated efficiently.  While most universities have transgenic labs where microinjections are performed, electroporation simplifies the procedure enough that individual labs might eventually do it themselves, she predicted.","Published: May 31, 2016"

The research by McGill University professor Simon Gravel and colleagues, was published May 27 in PLOS Genetics. Between 1910 and 1970, six million African Americans moved from the rural Southern United States to the urban Northeast, Midwest, and West   a phenomenon known to historians as the Great Migration. This migration had a profound impact on African-American communities and also on their nationwide genomic diversity.  In the new study, scientists from McGill and several U.S. institutions used genetic data from 3,726 African-Americans from across the U.S. to estimate patterns of ancestry. They report that 82.1% of African-Americans  ancestors resided in Africa prior to the advent of transatlantic travel, while 16.7% lived in Europe and 1.2% in the Americas. They find that African-Americans living in the southern U.S. have a greater percentage of African ancestry than those in the North or West and that individuals with higher European ancestry were more likely to migrate to the North and West, reinforcing regional differences in ancestry. The study s detailed approach to the analysis of African American genetics confirms previous findings and fills in details of African American heritage that may be absent from the historical record.  In addition to the genetic data,  we used a lot of census data and spent a lot of time in libraries, reading history and talking to historians,  to help round out the picture of migration patterns, says Gravel, an assistant professor in McGill s Department of Human Genetics and researcher at the McGill University and G nome Qu bec Innovation Centre. As researchers seek to increase the representation of African-Americans in medical genetic studies and reduce health disparities, this study will facilitate the design and analysis of nation-wide representative cohorts, Gravel adds.

Image Credit: Cheng Fang. Prion diseases are fatal and incurable neurodegenerative conditions of humans and animals. Yet, how prions kill nerve cells (or neurons) remains unclear. A study by Biochemistry department Professor and Chair David Harris, MD, PhD, describes a system in which to study the early assault by prions on brain cells of the infected host. Some of the earliest and potentially most critical changes in prion-infected brains occur at the connections (synapses) between neurons, and specifically at so-called dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are protrusions on the post-synaptic branches of a neuron that receive signals from other neurons. However, to date there has been no experimentally tractable model system in which the early degenerative changes caused by prions can be studied in cell culture. Harris and colleagues argue that the availability of a neuronal culture system susceptible to the toxic effects of prions is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and for potentially identifying drugs that block neurodegeneration. In this study, they report such a system, which reproduces acute prion neurotoxicity through degeneration of dendritic spines on cultured hippocampal neurons. The researchers summarize their results as follows:  We describe a new system that is capable of reproducing acute prion neurotoxicity, based on PrPSc-induced degeneration of dendritic spines on cultured hippocampal neurons . The system, they state,  provides new insights into the mechanisms responsible for prion neurotoxicity, and it provides a platform for testing potential therapeutic agents . Because  dendritic spine loss is a common theme in many neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer s, Huntington s, and Parkinson s diseases, and has been suggested to contribute to clinical symptoms in patients , the researchers also suggest that their system allows for  direct comparisons between pathogenic mechanisms involved in prion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders .","Published: May 31, 2016"

With reference to plant isoquinoline alkaloids, these substances have been named fumisoquins. Researchers from Jena discovered the novel substances together with their American colleagues while studying the fungal genome. The family of isoquinoline alkaloids contains many pharmacologically active molecules. This study, which has just been published in Nature Chemical Biology, shows that fungi and plants developed biosynthetic pathways for these complex molecules independently of each other. These findings make Aspergillus an interesting target for the discovery of novel drugs and their biotechnological production. Natural drugs A large number of drugs used today originate from nature. Most of these molecules, which can be found with or without synthetic modifications and exert their beneficial effect on human health, are derived from microorganisms or plants. Thus, it is of great interest to discover novel active compounds in nature and use them for the treatment of diseases. One well-known group of plant metabolites are the isoquinoline alkaloids. Today more than 2,500 different types are known and they are mainly found in poppy and barberry plants. Famous examples include the painkiller morphine or the cough remedy codein. Together with colleagues from the US, scientists in the labs of Prof. Dr. Dirk Hoffmeister and Prof. Dr. Axel Brakhage at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (Germany) found out that fungi synthesize certain natural products in a very similar way to plants. They analyzed the genome of the common mold Aspergillus and discovered a small cluster of genes whose function was previously unknown. Comparing these genetic sequences with known data implied that they might be responsible for the synthesis of novel natural products. Elucidated structure of the novel molecules By manipulating the genetic sequences, characterizing the resulting metabolites and using radioactive labeling experiments it was possible to elucidate the structure of the novel molecules and to unravel the detailed biosynthetic pathways. The researchers discovered a new linkage mechanism for carbon atoms which had never been seen before in fungi. The whole fumisoquin biosynthetic pathway appears to be a combination of plant biosynthetic principles and the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases commonly found in fungi. Axel Brakhage, university professor and head of the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, explains: ""Fungi and plants diverged early on during evolution. The newly discovered fumisoquin synthesis pathway shows that there was a parallel development for the production of isoquinoline alkaloid compounds in both groups of organisms. This opens up new roads for combinatorial biotechnology in order to advance the search for novel active compounds and thus to develop urgently needed new drugs."" Dirk Hoffmeister, professor at the Institute for Pharmacy at Friedrich Schiller University, is pleased with the joint efforts: ""The published study is a great example of the tight collaboration between the university and the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology - Hans Kn ll Institute - and our American partners.

Even those who are slightly overweight have a five-fold greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and for people who are seriously obese, the risk is 40 times greater. How does obesity lead to diabetes? A major part of the problem lies in the liver, and research from Ira Tabas  lab has found a certain series of biochemical events may be key. This biochemical chain reaction kicks in as people get heavier forcing liver cells to resist signals from insulin and pump more glucose into the bloodstream  thus paving the way for the development of type 2 diabetes. Dr. Tabas and his colleague, Lale Ozcan, MD, have been uncovering the components in this chain reaction and looking for ways to interrupt it. Their latest work identifies the last missing link in the chain, a molecule called DACH1, which had never been implicated in diabetes. The two researchers found that as mice become obese, DACH1 levels rise in the liver and help instigate the chain reaction that leads to diabetes. The same thing may be happening in people, Drs. Tabas and Ozcan found. DACH1 levels in the human liver went up markedly and consistently with increasing obesity, as seen in samples from liver biopsies taken from people undergoing surgery. Breaking the link between obesity and diabetes may be possible by reducing DACH1 levels in the liver. That tactic worked to improve glucose levels and insulin sensitivity in obese diabetic mice, Drs. Tabas and Ozan found, and could potentially work the same way in people. A compound that interrupts a protein further upstream in the DACH1 pathway is already being explored for future use in people.  The new information about DACH1 now gives us more opportunities to find the best approach,  Dr. Tabas says.","Published: May 31, 2016"

Conducted by members of the National Cancer Institute s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), including Baylor College of Medicine, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, and Washington University School of Medicine, the study takes aim at proteins, the workhorses of the cell, and their modifications to better understand cancer. Appearing in the Advance Online Publication of Nature, the study illustrates the power of integrating genomic and proteomic data to yield a more complete picture of cancer biology than either analysis could do alone. The effort produced a broad overview of the landscape of the proteome (all the proteins found in a cell) and the phosphoproteome (the sites at which proteins are tagged by phosphorylation, a chemical modification that drives communication in the cell) across a set of 77 breast cancer tumors that had been genomically characterized in the TCGA project. Although the TCGA produced an extensive catalog of somatic mutations found in cancer, the effects of many of those mutations on cellular functions or patients  outcomes are unknown. In addition, not all mutated genes are true  drivers  of cancer   some are merely  passenger  mutations that have little functional consequence. And some mutations are found within very large DNA regions that are deleted or present in extra copies, so winnowing the list of candidate genes by studying the activity of their protein products can help identify therapeutic targets.  We don t fully understand how complex cancer genomes translate into the driving biology that causes relapse and mortality,  said Matthew Ellis, director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine and a senior author of the paper.  These findings show that proteogenomic integration could one day prove to be a powerful clinical tool, allowing us to traverse the large knowledge gap between cancer genomics and clinical action.  In this study, the researchers at the Broad Institute analyzed breast tumors using accurate mass, high-resolution mass spectrometry, a technology that extends the coverage of the proteome far beyond the coverage that can be achieved by traditional antibody-based methods. This allowed them to scale their efforts and quantify more than 12,000 proteins and 33,000 phosphosites, an extremely deep level of coverage.  Advances in sample handling and instrumentation have brought on a revolution in mass spectrometry-based proteomics,  said Steven Carr, director of the Broad Institute s Proteomics Platform and a senior author of the study.  We can now apply that to the phosphoproteome, which is of central importance to understanding signaling in cancer and other diseases. Our approach produces robust and reproducible data, at a scale unachievable before.  As with other cancers, breast cancer tumors are known to harbor many mutations, so studying them all would require an endless number of experiments to discern the effects of various combinations of mutations in a model system. With this approach, however, the team can study the cancer cell in which those mutations evolved and analyze the integrated output of the cell s proteins. ""There is great potential for new insights to come from the combined analysis of cancer proteomic and genomic data, as proteomic data can now reproducibly provide information about protein levels and activities that are difficult or impossible to infer from genomic data alone,  said Douglas Lowy, acting director of the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. This analysis uncovered new protein markers and signaling pathways for breast cancer subtypes and tumors carrying frequent mutations such as PIK3CA and TP53 mutations. The team also correlated copy number alterations (extra or missing DNA) in some genes with protein levels, allowing them to identify 10 new candidate regulators. Two of these candidate genes, SKP1 and CETN3, can be connected to the oncogene EGFR, which is a marker for a particularly aggressive breast cancer subtype, known as  basal-like  tumors. Using transcriptional (mRNA) profiling, scientists have divided breast cancer into four major subtypes: luminal A and B subtypes, basal-like tumors, and HER2-enriched tumors. In this work, the researchers used proteomic and phosphoproteomic data to recapitulate basal and luminal subtypes. They were also able to identify a stromal-enriched cluster and, by clustering tumors based on phosphorylation pathways, they highlighted a G-protein-coupled receptor subgroup not seen with mRNA approaches. In the study and treatment of breast cancer, scientists and physicians hope to identify more drug gable kinase proteins in addition to HER2, which can be targeted with trastuzumab (Herceptin) but only in 20 percent of breast cancers that over express the HER2 protein. In this study, the researchers conducted an outlier analysis of the phosphorylation states of kinase enzymes, which highlighted aberrantly activated kinases in breast cancer samples, such as HER2, CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2, and TLK2.  It s always been important to get through to the molecules at work in the cell   the proteins   and this integrative exercise really gives us a whole new understanding of the landscape,  said Li Ding, assistant director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis.  The proteogenomic approach shows potential for funneling down to a much smaller set of proteins and modifications that are the interesting drivers that we should think about from a therapeutic standpoint.

The company has devised a pricing structure that will see the removal of any upfront investment costs for pharmaceutical companies looking to access the CDMO s serialisation capabilities. Recipharm will offer a standard solution across 14 locations in Europe and more than 70 production lines, with a fixed service fee per pack for all customers. Each serialised product will be compliant with the pending US and EU regulations, with any customisation of the pack offered separately. The announcement comes as the pharmaceutical industry faces the daunting task of meeting new legal requirements for the serialisation of licensed drug products from November 2017 in the US and early 2019 in Europe. Companies must adapt their packs, implement their tamper evidence capability and establish the systems, processes and data to comply with the EU Falsified Medicines Directive  Safety Features  Commission Delegated Regulation 2016/161 and the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), something that is expected to require significant financial investment. As part of its commitment to actively help pharmaceutical companies prepare for the regulatory changes, Recipharm recently announced plans to invest  40m over the next three years to ensure solutions for serialisation processes. As soon as the service is operational, the company will provide serialisation free-of-charge until the legal requirements come into effect to ensure drug developers are prepared ahead of the deadlines. The CDMO s company-wide serialisation project is being led by Staffan Widengren, Director Corporate Projects at Recipharm. He said:  We have spoken to our clients and conducted extensive research to help us fully understand the main challenges associated with the looming requirement for serialisation. Many companies are behind in their preparations, not fully aware of the scale and complexity of the task ahead and concerned about the required financial investment.  As a result of this consultation exercise, we have created a pricing model designed to spread the cost of serialisation across each customer s on-going supply agreement as opposed to them needing to make a major upfront investment. From 2023, we will extend this further, ensuring that serialisation is included as standard as part of our product manufacturing costs.  Having provided serialised products in Asia for a number of years, we understand the scale of the investment involved so are utilising our experience, technologies and capabilities to reduce costs for companies in Europe and the US.  The industry-wide serialisation, aggregation and verification directive is expected to improve traceability of drugs, help in the fight against counterfeit products entering the supply chain and ultimately improve patient safety.","Published: May 31, 2016"

Determining the structure of this protein complex helps us to understand the mechanism by which the two component proteins work together to clear sterols from the body,  said Dr. Daniel Rosenbaum, Assistant Professor of Biophysics and Biochemistry at UT Southwestern and a corresponding author of the study, which was published in Nature.  This knowledge, in turn, could lead to finding highly targeted therapies to treat or prevent diseases related to sterol imbalance.  Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes. Two ATP binding cassette (ABC) half transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, form a complex that transports sterols across membranes. Specifically, the ABCG5/ABCG8 complex is involved in excretion of sterols from the liver and the intestines. Disruption by mutations in either protein can lead to the disorder sitosterolemia. Patients with sitosterolemia have elevated levels of cholesterol and other sterols in their tissues and blood, which can cause heart attacks at an early age, Dr. Rosenbaum said. Under normal conditions, animals maintain sterol balance by limiting dietary sterol uptake from the gut and promoting sterol secretion from the liver into the bile, added Dr. Rosenbaum, a Eugene McDermott Scholar in Medical Research. Dr. Helen Hobbs, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator and Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development as well as a recent recipient of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for her work on cholesterol genetics, is the study s other corresponding author. Additionally, Dr. Hobbs is Chief of Clinical Genetics, Professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics, and holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research. Lead author Dr. Jyh-Yeuan  Eric  Lee, a research scientist in the McDermott Center, said humans have 48 ABC transporters that are classified into seven subfamilies, called A to G.  The structure we deduced for the ABCG5/ABCG8 complex represents a new type of ABC transporter architecture, and is the first mammalian ABC transporter to be crystallized in a lipid bilayer and solved to atomic resolution,  Dr. Lee said. In addition, Dr. Rosenbaum said, the study data could provide insight into the structural elucidation of other ABC transporters, most of which remain uncharacterized.

While aging weakens these connections, the team devised a way for the middle-aged brain to reconnect separate memories. The findings, which were published in the advance online edition of Nature, suggest a possible intervention for people suffering from age-related memory problems.  Until now, neuroscientists have focused on how the brain creates and stores single memories,  said principal investigator Alcino Silva, a professor of neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  We wanted to explore how the brain links two memories and whether the passage of time affects the strength of the connection.   In the real world, memories don t happen in isolation,  said first author Denise Cai, a researcher in Silva s lab.  Our past experiences influence the creation of new memories and help us predict what to expect and make informed decisions in the future.  In an intricate experiment, the UCLA team tested in young and middle-aged mice whether the brain linked memories of experiences separated by five hours versus seven days. Watching neurons in real time The lab used a miniature microscope, called a Miniscope, which was developed by UCLA neuroscientists Dr. Peyman Golshani, Baljit Khakh and Silva with funding from the presidential BRAIN Initiative and the Geffen School. The instrument s powerful camera allowed the scientists to peer into the brains of young mice and observe their cells in action. The tiny, head-mounted microscope illuminated the animals  neurons firing as the mice moved freely in their natural environments. For 10 minutes at a time, each mouse was placed in three boxes, all unique in terms of fragrance, shape, lighting and flooring. A week s time separated placement in the first and second boxes. Only five hours separated time spent in the second and third boxes, where the mouse later received a small shock to the foot. Two days later, the team returned each mouse to all three boxes. As expected, the mice froze with fear when it recognized the inside of the third box. What happened next, however, came as a surprise.  The mouse also froze in the second box, where no shock occurred,  Silva observed.  This suggests that the mouse transferred its memory of the shock in the third box to its experience in the second box five hours earlier.  When Silva and Cai examined the animals  brains, the neural activity confirmed their hypothesis.  The same brain cells that recorded the mouse s shock in the third box also encoded its memory of the second box a few hours earlier,  Cai said.  We saw 20 percent more overlap in the neural circuits that recorded the animal s experiences in the memories that unfolded closer in time.  In other words, says Silva,  The memories became interrelated in how they were encoded and stored by the brain, such that the recall of one memory triggered the recall of another memory related in time.  Exciting the brain Based on an earlier Silva finding, the team knew that a cell is most likely to encode a memory when it s aroused and ready to fire. Neuroscientists refer to this condition as excitability.  The excitable brain is already warmed up,  Silva said.  It s like stretching your muscles before exercise or revving your car engine before you drive.  Suspecting that aging weakens neurons  ability to fully excite, the UCLA researchers conducted a similar experiment in middle-aged mice. They introduced each of the mice to two boxes, five hours apart, and administered a foot shock in the second box. When they returned the animals to the boxes two days later, the results could not have been more clear-cut.  The older mice froze only in the box where they had received a shock,  Cai explained.  They did not react in the first box.  A glimpse into the Miniscopes confirmed that the brains of the mice did not connect the two memories; each memory was encoded on its own neural circuit. Rescuing lost connections Next the team focused on boosting the older animals  ability to link memories. Cai used a biological tool to excite neurons in a tiny part of the hippocampus   the memory center of the brain   before introducing the mice to the first box. She stimulated the same cells before placing the mice in the first box and the second box, where they received a foot shock two days later.  The proof in the pudding arrived when we reintroduced the middle-aged mice to the first box,  Silva said.  The animals froze   they now linked the shock that happened in the second box to the first. This suggests that increased excitability had reversed their age-related inability to link memories.  Cai and Silva are currently testing an FDA-approved drug s effect on the ability of middle-aged mice to connect memories. The work was supported by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke and the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation. The National Institute of Mental Health and the dean s fund at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA provided funding to Silva, Khakh and Golshani to develop the miniaturized microscopes.","Published: May 31, 2016"

This is the first time that imaging data has been used to show that our brains may have the ability to reverse the effects of schizophrenia. See Also: Schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk deconstructedSchizophrenia is an illness generally associated with a widespread reduction in brain tissue volume. However, a recent study found that a subtle increase in tissue also occurs in certain brain regions. The study followed 98 patients with schizophrenia and compared them to 83 patients without schizophrenia. The team used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a sophisticated approach called covariance analysis to record the amount of brain tissue increase. Due to the subtlety and the distributed nature of increase, this had not been demonstrated in patients before now. According to Lawson Health Research Institute's Dr. Lena Palaniyappan, there is an overarching feeling that curing people with a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia is not possible. ""Even the state-of-art frontline treatments aim merely for a reduction rather than a reversal of the cognitive and functional deficits caused by the illness,"" says Dr. Palaniyappan, who is the Medical Director at the Prevention & Early Intervention Program for Psychoses at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC). This comes from a long-standing notion that schizophrenia is a degenerative illness, with the seeds of damage sown very early during the course of brain development. ""Our results highlight that despite the severity of tissue damage, the brain of a patient with schizophrenia is constantly attempting to reorganize itself, possibly to rescue itself or limit the damage,"" says Dr. Palaniyappan. The team's next step is to clarify the evolution of this brain tissue reorganization process by repeatedly scanning individual patients with early schizophrenia and study the effect of this reorganization on their recovery. ""These findings are important not only because of their novelty and the rigour of the study, but because they point the way to the development of targeted treatments that potentially could better address some of the core pathology in schizophrenia,"" explains Dr. Jeffrey Reiss, Site Chief, Psychiatry, LHSC. ""Brain plasticity and the development of related therapies would contribute to a new optimism in an illness that was 100 years ago described as premature dementia for its seemingly progressive deterioration."" Learn More: Retinal changes may serve as measures of brain pathology in schizophrenia ""Dr. Palaniyappan and his colleagues have opened new avenues of research into our understanding of schizophrenia,"" says Dr. Paul Links, Chair/Chief, Psychiatry, LHSC.

Now, researchers reporting in the journal Current Biology have evidence that readily obtainable measures of the amount of glucose consumed by the brain can directly predict a person's current level of awareness, or the likelihood that they will recover awareness within a year. ""In nearly all cases, whole-brain energy turnover directly predicted either the current level of awareness or its subsequent recovery,"" says Ron Kupers of the University of Copenhagen and Yale University. ""In short, our findings indicate that there is a minimal energetic requirement for sustained consciousness to arise after brain injury."" See Also: How the brain produces consciousness in 'time slices'In the new study, Kupers, together with Johan Stender and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and the University of Li ge in Belgium, aimed to develop more-reliable diagnostic markers for the assessment of current and future levels of consciousness to complement routine bedside clinical examinations. To this end, they quantified and mapped cerebral glucose metabolism in 131 brain-injured patients, all of whom were suffering from either full or partial loss of consciousness. The researchers measured glucose metabolism using FDG-PET  (positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose), a well-known imaging technique in which glucose labeled with a radioactive tracer molecule is injected into the bloodstream. The labeled glucose makes it possible to capture and map glucose uptake in any organ of interest in this case, the brain. Their results showed that the patients' individual levels of behavioral responsiveness were strongly linked to their overall cerebral energy turnover. In fact, patients with glucose metabolism below a well-defined threshold of 42 percent of normal cortical activity appeared to be fully unconscious and did not recover consciousness at 1-year follow-up. In contrast, nearly all patients with brain metabolic activity above this energetic threshold either showed signs of awareness at the initial examination or had recovered responsiveness a year later. Overall, the researchers report, the cerebral metabolic rate accounted for the current level, or imminent return, of awareness in 94 percent of patients. ""The discovery of a clear metabolic boundary between the conscious and unconscious states could imply that the brain undergoes a fundamental state change at a certain level of energy turnover, in a sense that consciousness 'ignites' as brain activity reaches a certain threshold,"" Stender says. ""We were not able to test this hypothesis directly, but it provides a very interesting direction for future research."" Learn More: To recover consciousness, brain activity passes through newly detected states ""The take-home message [for now] is that consciousness is a highly energy demanding process, involving the brain at large,"" Kupers says. ""This fundamental physiological trait can help clinicians determine the potential for recovery of awareness in patients suffering from severe brain injuries of any kind."" The researchers say it will be important to verify the findings in an independent patient population. They also hope to explore how brain metabolism changes over time in brain-injured patients.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-brain-makes-and-breaks-habit-284287,How the brain makes and breaks a habit  Study identifies brain chemicals and neural pathway involved in switching between habitual behavior and deliberate decision making  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Study identifies brain chemicals and neural pathway involved in switching between habitual behavior and deliberate decision-making -Not all habits are bad. Some are even necessary. It's a good thing, for example, that we can find our way home on ""autopilot"" or wash our hands without having to ponder every step. But inability to switch from acting habitually to acting in a deliberate way can underlie addiction and obsessive compulsive disorders (OCDs). See Also: Why are habits so hard to break? Working with a mouse model, an international team of researchers demonstrates what happens in the brain for habits to control behavior. The study is published in Neuron and was led by Christina Gremel, assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, San Diego, who began the work as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health. Senior authors on the study are Rui Costa, of the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, and David Lovinger of the NIAAA/NIH. The study provides the strongest evidence to date, Gremel said, that the brain's circuits for habitual and goal-directed action compete for control in the orbitofrontal cortex, a decision-making area of the brain and that the neurochemicals called endocannabinoids allow for habit to take over, by acting as a sort of brake on the goal-directed circuit. Endocannabinoids are a class of chemicals produced naturally by humans and other animals. Receptors for endocannabinoids are found throughout the body and brain, and the endocannabinoid system is implicated in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain sensation, mood and memory. It is also the system that mediates the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Earlier work by Gremel and Costa had shown that the orbitofrontal cortex, or OFC, is an important brain area for relaying information on goal-directed action. They found that by increasing the output of neurons in the OFC with optogenetics they increased goal-directed actions. In contrast, when they decreased activity in the same area with a chemical approach, they disrupted goal-directed actions and the mice relied on habit instead. ""Habit takes over when the OFC is quieted,"" Gremel said. In the current study, since endocannabinoids are known to reduce the activity of neurons in general, the researchers hypothesized that endocannabinoids may be quieting or reducing activity in the OFC and, with it, the ability to shift to goal-directed action. They focused particularly on neurons projecting from the OFC into the dorsomedial striatum. They trained mice to perform the same lever-pressing action for the same food reward but in two different environments that differentially bias the development of goal-directed versus habitual actions. Like humans who don't suffer from neuropsychiatric disorders, healthy mice will readily shift between performing the same action using a goal-directed versus habitual action strategy. To stick with the earlier example of getting home, we can switch the homing autopilot off and shift to goal-directed behavior when we need to get to a new or different location. Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisionsTo test their hypothesis on the role played by endocannabinoids, the researchers then deleted a particular endocannabinoid receptor, called cannabinoid type 1, or CB1, in the OFC-to-striatum pathway. Mice missing these receptors did not form habits showing the critical role played by the neurochemicals as well as that particular pathway. ""We need a balance between habitual and goal-directed actions. For everyday function, we need to be able to make routine actions quickly and efficiently, and habits serve this purpose,"" Gremel said. ""However, we also encounter changing circumstances, and need the capacity to 'break habits' and perform a goal-directed action based on updated information. When we can't, there can be devastating consequences."" The findings may suggest, the authors say, a new therapeutic target for people suffering from OCD or addictions: To stop overreliance on habit and restore the ability to shift from habit to goal-directed action, it may be helpful to treat the brain's endocannabinoid system and so reduce habitual control over behavior. Treatment could be pharmaceutical or might involve behavioral therapy. Further research is needed. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Grand Challenges Explorations, a $100 million initiative funded by the Gates foundation, supports individuals worldwide to explore ideas that can break the mold in how to solve persistent global health and development challenges. Daniel Kamei, a UCLA professor of bioengineering, will pursue the innovative global health and development research project with co-investigator Dr. Anna-Barbara Moscicki, chief of adolescent and young adult medicine at Mattel Children s Hospital UCLA. She is also  a member of the UCLA Children s Discovery and Innovation Institute. Kamei was one of roughly 1,300 applicants applying for a Grand Challenges Explorations grant. The Gates foundation today announced the winners of more than 40 grants. Despite being potentially preventable and curable, cervical cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related death for women living in regions with limited health care resources. This is largely due to the lack of effective cervical cancer screening programs in developing countries, where there is a clear need for an alternative diagnostic approach to conventional methods. Cervical cancer screening has traditionally involved direct sampling of the cervix by a health care provider; that poses numerous physical and financial barriers in low-income countries. If women seek to sample cells at the cervix themselves with a vaginal swab, they are unlikely to collect reliable concentrations of biomarkers that can assess the potential for cancer. So women in resource-poor communities can greatly benefit from a simple, low-cost and equipment-free test that can be self-administered and provide easily interpretable results in less than 30 minutes, according to the UCLA researchers. Launched in 2008, Grand Challenges Explorations has funded more than 1,186 projects in more than 61 countries. Anyone from any discipline and organization may apply. The initiative uses an agile, accelerated grant-making process, starting with a two-page online application; no preliminary data required. Initial grants of $100,000 are awarded two times a year. Successful projects have the opportunity to receive a follow-on grant of up to $1 million. The foundation will be accepting applications for the next round of grants in September.","Published: May 27, 2016"

Scientists discovered that the diet triggers a death-and-life process for cells that appears critical for the body's repair. See Also: Study of self-awareness in multiple sclerosis has implications for rehabilitation ""During the fasting-mimicking diet, cortisone is produced and that initiates a killing of autoimmune cells,"" said Valter Longo, the study's lead author and professor who directs the USC Longevity Institute at the Davis School of Gerontology. ""This process also leads to the production of new healthy cells."" The study, published in the journal Cell Reports, included mice and human patients who have multiple sclerosis. The neurological disease affects an estimated 350,000 Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Symptoms range from blurred vision to paralysis. These latest findings follow studies by the same USC lab that showed cycles of a similar but shorter fasting-mimicking diet, when paired with drug treatments for cancer, protect normal cells while weakening cancerous ones. In a separate study published last year, the lab found that the diet can cut visceral belly fat and reduce markers of aging and diseases in mice and humans. ""We started thinking: If it kills a lot of immune cells and turns on the stem cells, is it possible that maybe it will kill the bad ones and then generate new good ones?"" Longo said. ""That's why we started this study."" Study details For the first part of the study, researchers put a group of mice with autoimmune disease on a fasting-mimicking diet for three days, every seven days for three cycles, with a control group on a standard diet for comparison. Results showed that the fasting-mimicking diet reduced disease symptoms in all the mice, and ""caused complete recovery for 20 percent of the animals,"" the researchers wrote. Learn More: Taking vitamin D may benefit people with multiple sclerosis Testing the mice, the researchers found reductions in symptoms attributed to health improvements such as increased levels of the steroid hormone, corticosterone, which is released by the adrenal glands to control metabolism. They also saw a reduction in the inflammation-causing cytokines proteins which order other cells to repair sites of trauma, infection or other pain. They also saw improvements in the white blood T cells, responsible for immunity. Finally, the researchers found that the fasting-mimicking diet promotes regeneration of the myelin the sheath of proteins and fats that insulate nerve fibers in the spine and brain that was damaged by the autoimmunity. Myelin is critical for the conduction of nerve impulses through the nervous system. In patients with multiple sclerosis, malfunctioning T cells attack the myelin and damage nerve fibers. Interfering with that degeneration while also promoting regeneration is critical for slowing the disease's development, which is what the periodic, regular fasts appear to trigger. ""On the one hand, this fasting-mimicking diet kills bad immune cells,"" Longo said. ""Then, after the mice return to the normal diet, the good immune cells but also the myelin-producing cells are generated, allowing a percentage of mice to reach a disease-free state."" The researchers also checked the safety and potential efficacy of the diet on people who have multiple sclerosis through a pilot trial with 60 participants with the disease, lead by Markus Bock at Charit  University Hospital in Berlin. Eighteen patients were placed on the fasting-mimicking diet for a seven day cycle and then placed on a Mediterranean diet for 6 months. Also for six months, 12 participants were on a controlled diet, and 18 others were on a ketogenic diet (a high-fat diet). Those who received a fasting mimicking diet cycle followed by the Mediterranean diet and those on a ketogenic diet reported improvements in their quality of life, improvements in health, including physical and mental health. The researchers noted that the study is limited because it did not test whether the Mediterranean diet alone would cause improvements, nor did it involve a functional MRI or immune function analysis. Longo said the findings beg further investigation. Researchers should determine whether a fasting-mimicking diet could help patients with other autoimmune diseases, and they should test the diet's efficacy in larger clinical trials. Don't Miss: New MRI technique offers faster diagnosis of multiple sclerosis Similar fasting-mimicking diets have been tested and found safe in trials. Longo said he believes patients with autoimmune disorders who are out of viable options should consult their doctors about the possibility of trying the diet or enrolling in a clinical trial that tests the diet's effect on autoimmune disorders. Longo said he has heard positive feedback from patients with disorders who tried the diet. ""We are optimistic,"" Longo said. ""What we don't want is patients trying to do this at home without involvement of their specialist or without understanding that larger trials are necessary to confirm that the diet, as a treatment, is effective against multiple sclerosis or other autoimmunities.""

Here the released neurotransmitter is bound and registered by receptors at the surface of the receiving nerve cell. This will, in turn, trigger a signal which is sent on to other nerve cells. The circuits in the brain using the neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine, GABA and serotonin are known to play an important role in mood, reward and mental well-being, and they also have a key role to in mental disorders such as addiction and depression. See Also: Obesity is associated with brain s neurotransmitters After release of neurotransmitters between nerve cells, they must, however, be removed again to end the signal. This is done by a family of transport proteins which function as molecular vacuum cleaners in the cell membrane of the nerve cell where they pump the neurotransmitter back into the nerve cell for later reuse. This transport is of great importance to the signaling between the nerve cells, but happens relatively slowly. A collaborative project between researchers from Aarhus University has made it possible to explain what happens in the crucial rate-limiting step in the transport process for neurotransmitters such as serotonin, noradrenaline, GABA and dopamine which are all transported by related proteins with the same mechanism. Transport of water-soluble neurotransmitters over a high-fat cell membrane is a complicated process which is challenged in the same way as the mixing of water and oil. The process is furthermore energy-consuming as the transport proteins have to work against a chemical gradient of already accumulated neurotransmitters inside the cell just as it requires energy to pump air into a bicycle tube. The driving force behind this neurotransmitter's pump process comes from sodium ions which follow the neurotransmitter, but which conversely go from a high concentration outside of the cell to a very low concentration inside the cell. This means that the pump process is driven by the co-transport of sodium ions. For the same reason, it is essential that the transport process does not short-circuit due to sodium ions being transported without a neurotransmitter, or in any other way leak ions. The neurotransmitter transporter's first task is therefore to bind a neurotransmitter molecule from the outside the nerve cell together with two sodium ions to a binding site in the centre of the protein. When they are in place, the transporter can perform a dramatic movement, closing the binding site towards the outside of the nerve cell and instead opening towards the interior of the nerve cell where the neurotransmitter and sodium are released. To enable the transporter to expose its binding site to the outside of the nerve cell again to carry out a new round of transport, it must, however, first make an opposite movement, i.e. from inward-oriented to outward-oriented but now without neurotransmitter and sodium ions. This change is the rate-limiting factor for how e.g. the serotonin transporter works and it is of great importance for the duration of the neurotransmitter signal. In other words, the transporter tends to remain in this inward-oriented state, and substances such as amfetamine and ecstasy work by highjacking the transporter exactly in this state and make it run in reverse instead, causing it to suddenly and uncontrollably release neurotransmitters instead of removing them. Learn More: Synapses always on the starting blocks By solving the molecular structure of a protein closely related to these neurotransmitter transporters, which is captured in a state during the reverse movement from inward-oriented to outward-oriented, it is now clear how the transporter solves the problem of moving without sodium ions and neurotransmitter. A centrally located and completely preserved element of transporters of this family is making a rotation which places this element in the empty binding pocket for neurotransmitters and distorts the binding sites of the sodium ions. Biochemical experiments and computer simulations show that this enables the transporter to revert to the outward-oriented state and at the same time will not bind sodium ions before the rotated element has rotated back. In this way the transporter only utilizes sodium in the forward process and not while reversing this process. Furthermore, the researchers have shown that if this rotating element is changed ever so slightly, the transporter will not work properly and is unable to perform its function. This new understanding of the mechanism of the neurotransmitter transporters gives hope for better opportunities for treating depression, overdose and addicition, as we now understand better how pharmaceuticals and drugs such as antidepressant, ecstasy and cocaine that bind to these transporters in different states must do so to ensure the right effect.

Disruptions to this 24-hour cycle of physiological activity are why jet lag or a bad night's sleep can alter your appetite and sleep patterns for days and even contribute to conditions like heart disease, sleep disorders and cancers. Now, scientists at the Salk Institute and collaborators have discovered a key player a protein called REV-ERB that controls the strength of this circadian rhythm in mammals. The discovery is unusual in the field, as most circadian genes and proteins only shift the timing or length of the daily cycle. See Also: Novel mechanism behind Alzheimer s-related circadian rhythm disruptions ""Whether it is Beethoven's 9th Symphony on your stereo or the symphony of genes in our bodies, both require volume to be heard,"" says senior author Ronald Evans, director of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and holder of the March of Dimes Chair in Molecular and Developmental Biology. ""Our recent work describes how REV-ERB  acts as a molecular conductor to allows the volume or activity of thousands of genes to be dialed up or down."" Disrupting just the amplitude or strength component of the circadian cycle, Evans adds, was enough to alter hormone levels, including those that wake us up in the morning. This means that people with lower amplitude fluctuations of the genes might feel flat and have less energy during the day. The results are described in the jorunal Cell. Previous research in the field revealed genes that cycle on and off throughout the day and showed how altering these circadian genes can shift the timing of the cycle and make the circadian rhythm longer or shorter than 24 hours. In 2012, Evans' group showed that REV-ERB  bound to many of these circadian genes and acted as a brake, affecting when during the day or night they were expressed. ""We saw REV-ERB  interacting with all these circadian-related genes,"" says Xuan Zhao, a research associate in the Evans lab and first author of the new paper. ""So we wanted to see if it had a more central role in circadian rhythms."" In the new work, the team analyzed levels and molecular characteristics of REV-ERB  in the livers of mice throughout the day. They found that after its levels peaked during the day, two proteins, CDK1 and FBXW7, interacted with REV-ERB  to help reduce its levels to a low point by the middle of the night. When Evans and his colleagues targeted these proteins to block the degradation of REV-ERB  in the livers of mice, normal daily fluctuations in gene expression were suppressed, but the timing of the cycles wasn't affected. Interestingly, merely altering the amplitude of the gene expression oscillations profoundly affected metabolism, disrupting the levels of fats and sugars in the blood. ""This study provides compelling molecular evidence for a key role for the circadian clock in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and points to new potential avenues for therapeutic intervention,"" says Steve Kay, president of The Scripps Research Institute, who collaborated with Evans on the work. Learn More: Altered circadian rhythm worsens Parkinson's disease, researchers showThe observation is the first time scientists have discovered a way to control the amplitude rather than the timing of the circadian cycle. Moreover, mice that lacked REV-ERB  developed fatty liver disease, stressing the importance of regulating the intensity of the cycle. ""We think that if you have a 'weak' circadian cycle, you can't get enough signal to affect physiology,"" says Zhao. ""Conversely, having an extra 'strong' circadian cycle would probably not be good. Evolution has given us a Goldilocks, or 'just right,' circadian cycle that is optimal for our health."" The researchers hope to investigate whether pharmacological compounds that block CDK1 may have the potential to treat circadian rhythm disruptions.

Now, researchers at Rockefeller University have described a new technique that combines the best of both worlds it captures a detailed snapshot of global activity in the mouse brain. ""We wanted to develop a technique that would show you the level of activity at the precision of a single neuron, but at the scale of the whole brain,"" says study author Nicolas Renier, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Marc Tessier-Lavigne, professor of the Laboratory of Brain Development and Repair, and president of Rockefeller University. See Also: Researchers open  Golden Window  in deep brain imaging The new method, described in Cell, takes a picture of all the active neurons in the brain at a specific time. The mouse brain contains dozens of millions of neurons, and a typical image depicts the activity of approximately one million neurons, says Tessier-Lavigne. ""The purpose of the technique is to accelerate our understanding of how the brain works."" ""Because of the nature of our technique, we cannot visualize live brain activity over time we only see neurons that are active at the specific time we took the snapshot,"" says Eliza Adams, a graduate student in Tessier-Lavigne's lab and co-author of the study. ""But what we gain in this trade-off is a comprehensive view of most neurons in the brain, and the ability to compare these active neuronal populations between snapshots in a robust and unbiased manner."" Here's how the tool works: The researchers expose a mouse to a situation that would provoke altered brain activity such as taking an anti-psychotic drug, brushing whiskers against an object while exploring, and parenting a pup then make the measurement after a pause. The pause is important, explains Renier, because the technique measures neuron activity indirectly, via the translation of neuronal genes into proteins, which takes about 30 minutes to occur. The researchers then treat the brain to make it transparent following an improved version of a protocol called iDISCO, developed by Zhuhao Wu, a postdoctoral associate in the Tessier-Lavigne lab and visualize it using light-sheet microscopy, which takes the snapshot of all active neurons in 3D. To determine where an active neuron is located within the brain, Christoph Kirst, a fellow in Rockefeller's Center for Studies in Physics and Biology, developed software to detect the active neurons and to automatically map the snapshot to a 3D atlas of the mouse brain, generated by the Allen Brain Institute. Although each snapshot of brain activity typically includes about one million active neurons, researchers can sift through that mass of data relatively quickly if they compare one snapshot to another snapshot, says Renier. By eliminating the neurons that are active in both images, researchers are left only those specific to each one, enabling them to home in on what is unique to each state. The primary purpose of the tool, he adds, is to help researchers generate hypotheses about how the brain functions that then can be tested in other experiments. For instance, using their new techniques, the researchers, in collaboration with Catherine Dulac and other scientists at Harvard University, observed that when an adult mouse encounters a pup, a region of its brain known to be active during parenting called the medial pre-optic nucleus, or MPO lights up. But they also observed that, after the MPO area becomes activated, there is less activity in the cortical amygdala, an area that processes aversive responses, which they found to be directly connected to the MPO ""parenting region"". Learn More: Atomic force microscopy for imaging nanoscale dynamics of neurons ""Our hypothesis,"" says Renier, ""is that parenting neurons put the brake on activity in the fear region, which may suppress aversive responses the mice may have towards pups."" Indeed, mice that are being aggressive to pups tend to show more activity in the cortical amygdala. To test this idea, the next step is to block the activity of this brain region to see if this reduces aggression in the mice, says Renier. The technique also has broader implications than simply looking at what areas of the mouse brain are active in different situations, he adds. It could be used to map brain activity in response to any biological change, such as the spread of a drug or disease, or even to explore how the brain makes decisions. ""You can use the same strategy to map anything you want in the mouse brain,"" says Renier. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The leading bacterial cause of death in young children worldwide is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occur in young children annually. A global network of researchers, coordinated from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford, therefore carried out a genome-wide association study to identify which genes might be associated with an increased likelihood of developing bacteraemia. Dr Anna Rautanen from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at Oxford, said: 'A key question is why only a proportion of individuals develop invasive disease despite widespread exposure and asymptomatic carriage of bacteria. We know that genetic differences contribute to individuals' chances of developing more serious disease. However, the relevant genes for bacteraemia susceptibility remain largely unknown.' The study looked at DNA samples from more than 4,500 Kenyan children from the Kilifi area, where Oxford and the Welcome Trust have a joint research centre with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and where there is a high occurrence of bacteraemia. Just over 4000 children were healthy, while slightly more than 500 had pneumococcal bacteraemia. The study found an area of two long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes that was associated with susceptibility to pneumococcal bacteraemia. LincRNAs are RNA transcripts that are longer than 200 nucleotides but are not translated into proteins. LincRNAs are still little understood, although it is believed that the human genome has more than 10,000 of them. Dr Rautanen said: 'One of the associated lincRNA genes, called AC011288.2, is expressed only in neutrophils, cells that are known to have a key role in clearing pneumococcal disease. Although the role of lincRNAs in human infections is unknown, recent mouse studies have indicated that some lincRNAs can act in immune cells to regulate an individual's susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. 'The genetic variants we identified have only been found in individuals with African ancestry.  This is one of only a few large scale genetic studies carried out in Africa and highlight the benefits of carried out these studies with collaborators in Africa. 'Critically, the genetic variants we have identified carry a doubled risk of developing bacteraemia when infected with the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. This discovery therefore provides clues in the pressing search for new ways to target the disease.'","Published: May 27, 2016"

The findings, published online in the journal Allergy, provide new insight into the development of food allergy and suggest potential therapies for prevention and treatment of food allergy. Although recent findings have suggested that early exposure to peanuts can help prevent peanut allergy, the only effective therapy currently available for existing cases remains avoidance. Histamine is a key participant in most allergic diseases including asthma, hay fever, and food allergy. When released by basophils or mast cells it can trigger a variety of symptoms, including inflammation, itchiness and mucus production. There are four histamine receptors found on a wide variety of cells in the body. Most commercially available antihistamines block only the H1 antihistamine receptor. Meiquin Wang, MD, PhD, Erwin Gelfand, MD, and their colleagues at National Jewish Health pretreated mice sensitized to peanut with the H1 receptor antagonist loratadine (Claritin), and the experimental H4 receptor antagonist JNJ7777120, separately and in combination. Separately, the two antihistamines had some effect on the intestinal response of the sensitized mice to peanut. When mice were pre-treated with both antihistamines together, diarrhea, intestinal inflammation and other symptoms were almost completely blocked. In vitro experiments indicated that the antihistamines work by suppressing the accumulation and function of dendritic cells, which take up peanut protein and present it to T cells of the immune system.","Published: May 27, 2016"

Now researchers at MIT and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) have identified a hidden, ephemeral phenomenon in cells that may play a major role in jump-starting mRNA production and regulating gene transcription. In a paper published in the online journal eLife, the researchers report using a new super-resolution imaging technique they ve developed, to see individual mRNA molecules coming out of a gene in a live cell. Using this same technique, they observed that, just before mRNA s appearance, the enzyme RNA polymerase II (Pol II) gathers in clusters on the same gene for just a few brief seconds before scattering apart. When the researchers manipulated the enzyme clusters in such a way that they stayed together for longer periods of time, they found that the gene produced correspondingly more molecules of mRNA. Clusters of Pol II therefore may play a central role in triggering mRNA production and controlling gene transcription. Ibrahim Ciss , assistant professor of physics at MIT, explains that because of their transient nature, enzyme clusters have largely been regarded as a mystery, and scientists have questioned whether such clustering is purposeful or merely coincidental. These new results, he says, suggest that, although short-lived, enzyme clustering can have a significant impact on major biological processes.  We think these weak and transient clusters are a fundamental way for the cell to control gene expression,  says Ciss , who is senior author on the paper.  If a small mutation changes the cluster s lifetime ever so slightly, that can also change the gene expression in a major way. It seems to be a very sensitive knob that the cell can tune.  What s more, Ciss  says scientists can now explore Pol II clusters as targets to  stall or induce a burst of transcription  and control the expression of certain genes, to explore cancer drugs and other gene therapies. The paper s co-authors include Won-Ki Cho, lead author and postdoc in the Department of Physics; Namrata Jayanth and Jan-Henrik Spille, also postdocs in physics; Takuma Inoue and J. Owen Andrews, graduate students in physics; and William Conway, an undergraduate in physics and biology; as well as researchers from HHMI s Janelia Research Campus: Brian English, Jonathan Grimm, Luke Lavis, and Timoth e Lionnet who is also co-senior author with Ciss . Imaging at super-resolution Pol II enzymes only cluster together for very short periods of time, on the order of several seconds. These clusters are also extremely small, on the scale of 100 nanometers in width. Because they are so tiny and fleeting, Pol II clusters and other weak and transient interactions have largely been hidden from view, essentially invisible to conventional imaging techniques.   To see these interactions, Ciss  and his colleagues developed a super-resolution imaging technique to visualize cellular processes at the single-molecule level. The team s technique builds on two existing super-resolution methods   photo-activation localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Both techniques involve tagging molecules of interest and lighting them up one by one to determine where each molecule is in space. Scientists can then merge every molecule s position to create one super-resolution image of the cellular region. While incredibly precise, these imaging techniques rely on the assumption that every molecule remains stationary. Molecules that come and go, and quickly cluster and scatter, are difficult to track. To catch Pol II clusters in action, Ciss  and his team tweaked existing super-resolution imaging techniques, looking not just at a single enzyme s position, but also at how frequently molecules were detected. The higher the frequency of detection, the higher the chance that a cluster has formed. The team applied their technique to image cells, using a camera that recorded one frame every 50 milliseconds, running continuously for up to 10,000 frames.   A transient lifetime They then created a cell line that included a bright fluorescent tag for mRNA, as well as a fluorescent tag of a different color for Pol II enzymes. The team applied its super-resolution technique to image a particular gene inside the cell, called beta-actin, which has been characterized extensively. In experiments with live cells, the researchers observed that, while previously transcribed mRNA molecules lit up on the gene, new Pol II clusters appeared on the same gene, for about 8 seconds, before disassembling. From these experiments, the group was uncertain as to whether the clusters had any impact on mRNA production, since the time it takes from the start of transcription to the complete production of mRNA takes significantly longer   about 2.5 minutes. Could a cluster, appearing for just a fraction of that time, have any effect on mRNA? To answer this question, the team stimulated the cells with a chemical cocktail which they knew would affect gene transcription and mRNA output. In these cells, they found that, just before the mRNA peak appeared, clusters formed on the gene and actually remained stable for as long as 24 seconds   a fourfold increase in a cluster s typical lifetime. What s more, the number of mRNAs increased by a similar amount. After repeating the experiment in 207 living cells, the team found that the lifetime of Pol II clusters was directly related to the number of mRNA produced from the same gene. Ciss  speculates that perhaps Pol II clusters acts as an efficient driver of gene transcription, speeding up an otherwise inefficient process.  It makes sense that you wouldn t want an efficient initiation process, because you don t want to randomly turn on any gene just because there was a random collision,  Ciss  says.  But you also want to have a way to change the initiation from an inefficient to an efficient process, for example when you want to express a gene in response to some environmental stimuli. We think that these transient clusters are probably the way that the cell can render transcription initiation efficient.  Next, Ciss  plans to follow up his studies on Pol II clusters to determine what are the forces holding them together, as well as how they re formed, and whether other molecular factors cluster with similar effects.  I suspect there are new biophysical phenomena that come from weak and transient interactions,  Ciss  says.  This is an underexplored area in biology, and because the interactions are so elusive we understand very little about how the regulatory processes happen inside a living cell.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-do-you-kill-a-malaria-parasite-197220,How Do You Kill A Malaria Parasite   Drexel University scientists have discovered an unusual mechanism for how two new antimalarial drugs operate  They give the parasite s skin a boost in cholesterol  making it unable to traverse the narrow labyrinths of the human bloodstream  The drugs also seem to trick the parasite into reproducing prematurely  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. After a person is bitten, the parasite invades the victim s red blood cells. There, it eventually divides into daughter parasites, which continue to destroy each red blood cell they infect. There are several drugs under development that interrupt this life cycle, including a class of compounds discovered in 2014 by Akhil Vaidya, PhD, a professor at Drexel University College of Medicine. In their 2014 study, Vaidya and his research team found that these drugs increase levels of sodium within the parasites  cells, causing them to swell and erupt. However, in a new study, published recently in PLOS Pathogens, the researchers have revealed that this sodium increase actually triggers a more complex cascade of events, eventually changing the parasite s outer membrane and also tricking it into early reproduction, which renders the parasite inert.  Nobody suspected something like this to be the mode of action,  said Vaidya, who also directs Drexel s Center for Molecular Parasitology.  The mechanism is a lot more complicated and interesting than we originally thought.  In this study, the scientists focused on two small-molecule drugs, one of which is undergoing clinical trials. Despite very different molecular structures, both drugs initially increase sodium within the parasite and subsequently kill the pathogen. Until now, scientists have not understood why the increase in sodium concentration leads to the malaria parasite s demise. To explore this question, the researchers first tested the properties of the Plasmodium plasma membrane   or the parasite s outer skin   before and after exposure to antimalarial drugs. The Plasmodium membrane is unusual, because it contains very low levels of cholesterol, a major lipid component of most other membranes, including those of human red blood cells. The Drexel scientists hypothesized that the low cholesterol content permits greater flexibility for the parasite to travel through the human bloodstream and to withstand the stress of blood circulation. They propose that the sodium increase, caused by the antimalarial drugs, somehow interferes with that elasticity. The researchers used a cholesterol-dependent detergent to detect the presence of lipids in the parasite membrane. They found that indeed both drug treatments appeared to add a significant amount of cholesterol to the Plasmodium plasma membrane.  We believe that the cholesterol makes the parasite rigid, and then the parasite can no longer pass through very small spaces in the bloodstream,  Vaidya said, adding that the parasite cannot continue its lifecycle if it cannot enter red blood cells. Just two hours after treatment, the scientists also saw that many of the parasites showed fragmented nuclei and interior membranes, which are the precursors to cell division. But these changes happened without any sign that the parasite s genome had multiplied   a step that is necessary for a cell to divide and survive. The researchers hypothesize that sodium influx is a normal step during the malaria parasite s division. The antimalarial drugs prematurely induce this signaling event, and the parasite begins dividing before it should. Malaria Parasite  The parasite is not ready to divide yet, so it can not survive. It is like premature delivery of an infant,  Vaidya said.  This whole cascade of events is triggered by these drug treatments.  Malaria is the world s deadliest parasitic disease. It kills more than 300,000 people per year, according to the World Health Organization, and affects up to 300 million. One of the biggest challenges for treating malaria is drug resistance. The drugs that are currently available are quickly losing their potency, so researchers are scrambling to develop stronger treatments. By understanding exactly how new drug candidates stop malaria, Vaidya and his team aim to reveal more about the parasite s vulnerabilities. This, they hope, will eventually lead to the creation of more effective drugs against the disease. Vaidya noted that the best defense against malaria will always be a combination of treatments.  We want to find the best ways to keep new drugs effective as long as we can,  Vaidya said.","Published: May 27, 2016"

But biologists from UC San Diego and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands have uncovered important clues about this mechanism from an organism commonly encountered in soil, but often unnoticed: the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. The scientists report in the journal Developmental Cell that the key to the directional ability of this microscopic organism, affectionately known to biologists as  Dicty,  is a protein that when activated by chemicals secreted by bacteria allows the slime mold to home in on and feed on bacteria living in soil.  Like white blood cells, Dicty has the ability to distinguish and respond differently to a variety of chemical cues, and a sense of direction,  said Richard Firtel, a professor of biology at UC San Diego who co-headed the research collaboration with Arjan Kortholt from the University of Groningen.  When a white blood cell encounters a chemical signal, the chemical binds to proteins, called receptors, on the surface of the white blood cell. These receptors are evenly distributed over the surface of the cell, but the cell has a remarkable ability to identify the type of chemical and the direction from which it originated.   The white blood cell then rearranges the internal cellular machinery that allows it to crawl, often over great distances, toward the source of the chemical where it devours the bacteria and wards off infection. While the signals and their receptors and the machinery that allows a cell to crawl were known, the link that determines the type of response and that gives a cell a sense of direction was a mystery.  Firtel and his colleagues discovered that a protein called  GflB  is most often found  floating  inside the Dicty cell in a folded-up and inactive state. When chemical signals from bacteria bind to a receptor on the surface of Dicty, they discovered, the receptor recruits GflB, which then communicates this information to locally assemble the crawling machinery. Since the chemicals reach the cells as a wave with the highest amount on the side facing the chemical source, the researchers found, GflB is also most active on this side and forms a  leading edge  that orients movement toward the source.  Similar processes of directed cell movement using chemical cues are hijacked by metastasizing cancer cells to migrate to and invade distant sites in a human body,  said Firtel.  Since GflB and its interacting proteins are found in all species, including humans, our findings provide a keystone to understanding how cells know the direction in which they need to migrate. Thus, understanding how this process works allows us to understand how our immune system functions and also provides the necessary information to develop effective cures for a range of diseases, including cancer.  Other authors of the paper, in addition to Firtel and Kortholt, were Jesus Lacal of UC San Diego; Youtao Liu, Fabrizia Fusetti and Peter van Haastert of the University of Groningen; and Douwe Veltman of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

Their study published in Science Translational Medicine finds that expression of human amyloid-beta (A-beta) was protective against potentially lethal infections in mice, in roundworms and in cultured human brain cells. The findings may lead to potential new therapeutic strategies and suggest limitations to therapies designed to eliminate amyloid plaques from patient s brains.   Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer s disease has been thought to be caused by the abnormal behavior of A-beta molecules, which are known to gather into tough fibril-like structures called amyloid plaques within patients  brains,  says Robert Moir, MD, of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit in the MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MGH-MIND), co-corresponding author of the paper.  This widely held view has guided therapeutic strategies and drug development for more than 30 years, but our findings suggest that this view is incomplete.  A 2010 study co-led by Moir and Rudolph Tanzi, PhD, director of the MGH-MIND Genetics and Aging Unit and co-corresponding author of the current study, grew out of Moir s observation that A-beta had many of the qualities of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), a small innate immune system protein that defends against a wide range of pathogens. That study compared synthetic forms of A-beta with a known AMP called LL-37 and found that A-beta inhibited the growth of several important pathogens, sometimes as well or better than LL-37. A-beta from the brains of Alzheimer s patients also suppressed the growth of cultured Candida yeast in that study, and subsequently other groups have documented synthetic A-beta s action against influenza and herpes viruses.  The current study is the first to investigate the antimicrobial action of human A-beta in living models. The investigators first found that transgenic mice that express human A-beta survived significantly longer after the induction of Salmonella infection in their brains than did mice with no genetic alteration. Mice lacking the amyloid precursor protein died even more rapidly.  Transgenic A-beta expression also appeared to protect C.elegans roundworms from either Candida or Salmonella infection. Similarly, human A-beta expression protected cultured neuronal cells from Candida. In fact, human A-beta expressed by living cells appears to be 1,000 times more potent against infection than does the synthetic A-beta used in previous studies.  That superiority appears to relate to properties of A-beta that have been considered part of Alzheimer s disease pathology   the propensity of small molecules to combine into what are called oligomers and then aggregate into  beta-amyloid plaques. While AMPs fight infection through several mechanisms, a fundamental process involves forming oligomers that bind to microbial surfaces and then clump together into aggregates that both prevent the pathogens from attaching to host cells and allow the AMPs to kill microbes by disrupting their cellular membranes. The synthetic A-beta preparations used in earlier studies did not include oligomers; but in the current study, oligomeric human A-beta not only showed an even stronger antimicrobial activity, its aggregation into the sorts of fibrils that form  beta-amyloid plaques was seen to entrap microbes in both mouse and roundworm models.  Tanzi explains,  AMPs are known to play a role in the pathologies of a broad range of major and minor inflammatory disease; for example, LL-37, which has been our model for A-beta s antimicrobial activities, has been implicated in several late-life diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and atherosclerosis. The sort of dysregulation of AMP activity that can cause sustained inflammation in those conditions could contribute to the neurodegenerative actions of A-beta in Alzheimer s disease.  Moir adds,  Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that Alzheimer s pathology may arise when the brain perceives itself to be under attack from invading pathogens, although further study will be required to determine whether or not a bona fide infection is involved. It does appear likely that the inflammatory pathways of the innate immune system could be potential treatment targets. If validated, our data also warrant the need for caution with therapies aimed at totally removing beta-amyloid plaques. Amyloid-based therapies aimed at dialing down but not wiping out beta-amyloid in the brain might be a better strategy.  Says Tanzi,  While our data all involve experimental models, the important next step is to search for microbes in the brains of Alzheimer s patients that may have triggered amyloid deposition as a protective response, later leading to nerve cell death and dementia. If we can identify the culprits   be they bacteria, viruses, or yeast    we may be able to therapeutically target them for primary prevention of the disease.""","Published: May 27, 2016"

An initial project will be to develop and market PITX2 as a marker to predict effectiveness of anthracycline treatment in triple negative and other high-risk breast cancer patients.  We are pleased to partner with Therawis, which developed the PITX2 assay and achieved initial clinical validation , said Kai te Kaat, Head of QIAGEN s Oncology Franchise.  The test addresses high unmet needs in breast cancer, the most common malignancy among women, and will add to our expanding portfolio that covers a range of Sample to Insight solutions to further advance personalized healthcare in this and other cancer indications.    Prof. Dr. med. Olaf G. Wilhelm, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Therawis, an oncology-focused company founded by clinicians and scientists at the Technical University of Munich commented:  Partnering with QIAGEN will make our PITX2 test widely available in standardized workflows for routine diagnostics and to benefit breast cancer patients globally. We look forward to co-developing and commercializing additional tests. Therawis is uniquely focused on bringing to market predictive diagnostics to guide the optimal therapy for breast cancer patients.  Under current clinical guidelines, the standard of care in high-risk breast cancer includes anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which produces a response rate of 50% or less in patients and has side effects that can be as severe as congestive heart failure or leukemia. The PITX2 test licensed by QIAGEN predicts which individuals will benefit from these chemotherapeutic drugs. It potentially could enable clinicians to make decisions on whether to use standard drugs or provide other treatments to patients who are unlikely to benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The PITX2 biomarker also has potential value for a companion diagnostic to guide the use of novel targeted therapies under development. About 1.7 million new breast cancer cases are reported each year, making it the most common cancer among women and second-most common overall, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Annual deaths due to breast cancer are estimated at more than 500,000. As with other cancers, the disease varies greatly among individuals, as do outcomes, based on many different factors. For example, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) makes up about 15% of cases, about 120,000 a year in Europe and the U.S., with a poor prognosis and low overall survival rate. The standard of care for TNBC is a core biopsy, neo adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by surgery. Only about 35% of TNBC patients respond to the chemotherapy, and 65% do not. So the value of a reliable predictive test to guide treatment decisions would be significant. To date, the PITX2 biomarker has demonstrated unprecedented predictive value in triple-negative and other high-risk breast cancers.","Published: May 27, 2016"

The scientists from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and their colleagues also reported achieving another major milestone, by showing that the shapes of cancer target proteins too small to be considered within the reach of current cryo-EM capabilities can now be determined at high resolution. The research team was led by NCI s Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., with contributions from scientists at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), also part of NIH. The findings appeared online May 26, 2016, in Cell.  These advances demonstrate a real-life scenario in which drug developers now could potentially use cryo-EM to tweak drugs by actually observing the effects of varying drug structure   much like an explorer mapping the shoreline to find the best place to dock a boat   and alter its activity for a therapeutic effect,  said Doug Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI. Both discoveries have the potential to have an impact on drug discovery and development. Cryo-EM imaging enables analysis of structures of target proteins bound to drug candidates without first needing a step to coax the proteins to form ordered arrays. These arrays were needed for the traditional method of structure determination using X-ray crystallography, a powerful technique that has served researchers well for more than a half century. However, not all proteins can be crystallized easily, and those that do crystallize may not display the same shape that is present in their natural environment, either since the protein shape can be modified by crystallization additives or by the contacts that form between neighboring proteins within the crystal lattice.  It is exciting to be able to use cryo-EM to visualize structures of complexes of potential drug candidates at such a high level of detail,  said Subramaniam.  The fact that we can obtain structures of small cancer target proteins bound to drug candidates without needing to form 3D crystals could revolutionize and accelerate the drug discovery process.  Two of the small proteins the researchers imaged in this new study, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), are active targets for cancer drug development. Mutations in the genes that code for these proteins are common in several types of cancer. Thus, imaging the surfaces of these proteins in detail can help scientists identify molecules that will bind to them and aid in turning the protein activity off.","Published: May 27, 2016"

The study, which combined a new variant of CRISPR gene-editing technology with automated cell imaging, generated new understanding of the fundamental gene networks that make bacteria so resilient to environmental stress and   increasingly   to antibacterial drugs. The research also demonstrated a practical approach to identifying the mechanism of action of potential new antibiotic compounds, which the researchers hope can be harnessed to aid the design of better drugs to fight a growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance. Most of the core aspects of complex life, such as how cells copy their DNA, reproduce, and make key proteins and membranes, are based on the same genes and protein machinery found in simple, single-celled bacteria. But even in bacteria, how all these proteins work together to power life is only partly understood. In the new study, a team led by UCSF cell biologist Carol Gross, PhD, and Stanford bioengineers K.C. Huang, PhD, and Stanley Qi, PhD, used their combined expertise in microbiology, cellular imaging, and genetic engineering to develop a new approach to understanding what makes bacteria tick.  Previously, genetic study of the most essential genes for life was very challenging,  said Gross, a professor of cell and tissue biology and of microbiology and immunology in UCSF s School of Dentistry. Geneticists often learn about a gene s function by experimentally switching off a gene and observing what happens to the cell in what is called a  knockout  experiment, Gross said.  The problem with studying the most fundamental genes, though, is that you can t knock them out   the cells would just die.  The new findings   published online in the journal Cell on May 26, 2016   relied on a new technique that allowed the researchers to instead generate  knockdowns  of each gene of interest. Unlike a knockout s binary on-off switch, a knockdown experiment essentially places a volume knob on each gene to gently turn down how much protein a cell makes. This way the researchers could turn down an essential gene s activity just enough to examine its importance in a cell s daily activities, but not enough to kill the cell outright. The technique, called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), was recently developed by Qi, now an assistant professor of bioengineering and of chemical and systems biology in Stanford s Schools of Engineering and Medicine, when he was a Systems Biology Fellow at UCSF. Qi s CRISPRi technology is quite different from the CRISPR-Cas9 techniques that are increasingly used by genetic engineers as a simple tool for cutting and splicing DNA: Instead of modifying DNA, CRISPRi precisely tunes cells  production of specific proteins. The researchers used CRISPRi to systematically knock down the production of each of 258 essential proteins in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, one gene at a time, and then observed how the cellular machinery performed in this weakened state using high-throughput, computer-controlled microscopy developed by Huang s lab. For the vast majority of essential proteins, the researchers found, a complete loss of the protein produced major disruptions to the cells  integrity: deforming their normal shape or causing them to burst open and sabotaging cell division or simply halting growth altogether. By contrast, using CRISPRi to partially deprive the cells of these proteins produced subtler changes, and revealed that the essential proteins fell into two classes: those that changed cell shape through direct control of the bacterial cell wall, and modulators that affected cell shape through indirect mechanisms.  These findings reveal a new set of failure modes that can be targeted by antibiotics and demonstrate how cells have evolved to couple their systems together to avoid these fates,  said Huang, a professor of bioengineering and of microbiology and immunology in Stanford s schools of Engineering and Medicine. Genetic Redundancies and Fail-Safes Are Key to Bacterial Resilience The team also subjected each knockdown to more than 100 different stresses, such as dosing them with antibiotics or varying their nutrient supply. By analyzing nearly 30,000 combinations of essential protein knockdowns and environmental stressors, the team characterized the importance of the different essential proteins for coping with particular environmental stressors, and observed a number of key principles of bacterial resilience. They also showed that the technique has the potential to be used to identify the biological mechanisms of new antibiotic compounds. To test their approach as a platform for drug discovery, the researchers demonstrated that the knockdown of a particular enzyme important for building bacterial cell walls made cells uniquely susceptible to an antibiotic whose mode of action was previously unknown. Such experiments, the team said, highlight the power of studying all essential genes at once, an approach they say could be an efficient way to characterize targets of other antibiotic drugs, which is a major bottleneck in the transfer of drugs from the lab to the clinic.  Other experiments illustrated that bacterial cells have evolved many redundancies   such as producing more of each critical protein than they need as a rainy-day supply for times of starvation. The researchers learned that bacteria also have backups for many essential proteins, a fail-safe mechanism that allows them to better withstand genetic mutations or pharmacological attacks. For example, one experiment focused on three proteins known to play critical roles in creating bacterial cells  protective outer layer, a vital process that is targeted by several of the most effective current antibiotics.  We turned down the first protein from full blast to zero, and the cells were fine,  Gross said.  We did the same for the second protein and still things were fine. We had to knock down all three proteins before the cell died. So while the process is essential, each protein was not.  The team went on to discover dozens of pairs of proteins with seemingly unrelated functions that provide similar levels of resilience to environmental stresses, suggesting that cells have redundant backup systems for dealing with disruptions to key systems.  In a way, these experiments allowed us to reverse engineer evolution by observing its results across every living process,  Huang said.  Our findings suggest that cells are optimized to survive adversity. It makes sense given that often during bacterial evolution, nutrients would have been in short supply and environmental conditions harsh. Therefore the essential genes and proteins would have evolved so that cells survive in times of scarcity. ","Published: May 27, 2016"

The award will support the collection, storage and distribution for research use of biological samples known as biospecimens. Laboratory analyses of the biospecimens, including chemical and genetic tests, will be a key component of the core PMI Cohort Program data set. These data, combined with other information provided by volunteers such as lifestyle and health questionnaires, medication history, electronic health records, physical exams, and environmental exposures and real time physiology tracked through mobile health technologies, will help researchers study individual differences in health and disease.   This range of information at the scale of 1 million people will be an unprecedented resource for researchers working to understand all the factors that influence health and disease,  said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.  The more we understand about individual differences, the better able we will be to tailor the prevention and treatment of illness.  The Mayo Clinic will provide the infrastructure to store, analyze and make available to researchers more than 35 million biospecimens and associated data using state-of-the-art laboratory automation and robotics for efficient processing and retrieval. Biobank staff will follow a detailed set of policies to safeguard the collection against contamination or loss and to protect participant confidentiality. Additionally, the Mayo Clinic Florida Biospecimen Accessioning and Processing Core laboratory site will provide sample storage for 20-25 percent (8-10 million samples) of the collection, in order to protect the national resource from a localized natural disaster. Stephen N. Thibodeau, Ph.D., co-director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine Biorepositories Program, and Mine Cicek, Ph.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Biospecimen Accessioning and Processing Core Laboratory, will oversee the biobank. Dr. Thibodeau also will serve on the PMI Cohort Program Steering Committee to help guide the program s plans and activities.  This is an extraordinary opportunity for Mayo Clinic to participate with NIH and share our expertise in such an important national research initiative,  says Dr. Thibodeau.

For decades, new antibiotics have been discovered and made using a process called semi-synthesis, which chemically modifies natural products. However, the snag is that it's difficult to selectively control the desired chemical modifications on structurally complex natural products, which greatly limits the new drug candidate molecules that can be made. Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic obtained by fermentation, was first discovered in 1949 and its semi-synthetic derivatives azithromycin and clarithromycin are commonly prescribed for treating various respiratory tract and skin infections such as pneumonia, gonorrhoea and streptococcal pharyngitis. They work by disrupting the bacterial ribosome and hence protein production. But bacterial resistance to these approved macrolide antibiotics is now widespread and semi-synthesis can't provide the new macrolides required to keep up. 'Our goal was not to make a single molecule [as with semi-synthesis] but to develop a design strategy that by its nature would enable the preparation of thousands or even tens of thousands of clinical candidates,' explains Andrew Myers at Harvard University, US, whose group led the study.  'With a fully synthetic route we have access to orders of magnitude greater numbers of structures for study, and can effectively modify just about any position of the scaffold. That can t be said of semi-synthetic approaches.' Myers' lab previously developed the first practical, scalable synthetic route to make tetracycline antibiotics, also based on building blocks, in 2005.2,3 This time, the group turned to macrolides which involved using eight different building blocks to assemble large 14 to 16 membered rings by a series of convergent coupling reactions; constructing these macrocyclic rings via synthetic means has traditionally been a tough challenge. Candidate diversity What Myers' team did was invent crucial but simple chemistry to enable the necessary bond formations, including an aldol addition reaction   a type of carbon carbon bond-forming reaction   which is a key early coupling reaction in the route. 'What we did not do is almost as important as what we did do,' adds Myers. 'We vetoed any plans that were overly long and linear, or which used chemistry that would not be amenable to scale.' The method produced over 300 structurally diverse macrolide antibiotic candidate molecules previously inaccessible via semi-synthesis. These included the approved drug telithromycin, and the clinical candidate solithromycin, which are effective against community-acquired pneumonia. What's more, gram quantities of macrolides were made which is ample for drug discovery purposes. Tests revealed that most of the compounds had antibiotic activity against an array of pathogenic bacteria, and some were active against bacterial strains that show resistance to macrolides in current use. These included the clinically relevant  superbug  strains methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, better known as MRSA, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. 'What is particularly remarkable here is that this class of natural products has been explored extensively in the context of semi-synthesis, synthetic biology and even total synthesis yet this new approach is the only one that is robust and flexible enough to provide a myriad of new, deeply modified analogs in an economically viable fashion,' comments organic synthesis researcher Phil Baran from The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, US. 'Since overcoming resistance is a constant battle, the value of this approach is that it offers an opportunity to access new areas of relevant chemical space in a significantly truncated timeframe.' 'Frankly, at the outset of the project I never dreamed that our solution would be as powerful or general as it turned out,' says Myers. 'One reason for optimism is that the chemical space we can explore is so vast that it will take years if not decades to thoroughly investigate it.'","Published: May 27, 2016"

As part of this research initiative, Flatiron Health and the FDA are collaborating on a project to investigate the use of immunotherapies in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Flatiron Health and the FDA will use this project to explore analytic approaches, clinically-relevant endpoints and safety assessment methods using real-world evidence.  With only four percent of the adult U.S. cancer population enrolled in clinical trials, we as providers are currently limited to making clinical decisions based upon study results that represent only a small number of patients. This makes it nearly impossible to estimate whether a treatment will work, anticipate all of the potential side effects of therapies or even decide which treatment should precede another,  said Amy Abernethy, chief medical officer and senior vice president, Oncology, Flatiron Health.  Collaborative projects such as this one with the FDA allow us to access real-world evidence for more accurate and actionable insights into patient care and expected outcomes outside of clinical trials, supporting the delivery of high quality patient care.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with more than 220,000 new cases and approximately 160,000 deaths in 2015. In recent years, immunotherapy - a novel class of therapies that leverage the body s own immune system to help fight cancer - has emerged as a promising approach in the treatment of aNSCLC.

Like keys on a piano keyboard, each component of an odor blend strikes only one chord of olfactory neuron activation. These chords are combined to form a melody that is ""heard"" in the brain as distinctly citrusy or sweet and flowery. More than 25 years of neurobiology research has provided us with the understanding that there is a one-to-one-correspondence between the individual smells detected by an olfactory sensory neuron and the chemical receptor it expresses. This proprietary linking explains how distinct information about odors travels along parallel sensory pathways to the brain, and enables the brain to identify and distinguish different smells in the world. See Also: Can autism be measured in a sniff? That understanding included the mechanism behind this correspondence: the activity of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in sensory neurons. As their name indicates, these chemoreceptors span a cell membrane seven times. They are the source of a biochemical signaling cascade inside the neuron that reaches the brain to say ""orange"" or ""rose"" or any other odor one can detect. Or at least this seemed to be the case. Harvard Medical School scientists have uncovered a new and different way that some odors are sensed in what is known as the ""olfactory necklace,"" a subsystem of sensory neurons whose axons encircle the olfactory bulb, which they explored in mice. The new class of chemoreceptors they discovered defines an alternative mechanism for odor detection and a novel logic for mammalian olfaction that has more in common with taste than with smell. Their findings, from a team led by Sandeep Datta, Harvard Medical School (HMS) assistant professor of neurobiology, are published in Cell. ""We found a totally different way of detecting smells, and a family of receptors that had not been previously characterized,"" said Paul Greer, HMS research fellow in neurobiology and co-first author of the paper. Learn More: Understanding how neurons shape memories of smells The necklace receptors span the neuron's membrane four times, not seven. And rather than each sensory neuron in the necklace expressing just one receptor, each neuron in the necklace expresses a whole family of receptors, upending the one-receptor-per-neuron dogma. ""We think this new olfactory system is set up in a way that alerts the brain to the presence of some class of chemical stimuli, rather than giving a precise pattern like the rest of the olfactory system,"" said Daniel Bear, a PhD student in the Harvard Program in Neuroscience and co-first author of the paper. What types of odors could be so crucial as to warrant an alert system? The HMS researchers already knew that cells in the olfactory necklace have receptors that detect carbon dioxide, a naturally aversive stimulus for the mouse. They wondered if such innate detectors had evolved to spur important behaviors such as avoiding threats. This olfactory alert system appears to have an ancient origin but continue to have value for animals. Rather than discriminating between odors, these necklace receptors may instead detect a variety of odors that trigger particular innate behaviors. According to Datta, finding these receptors required ""fishing without a hook."" The scientists searched for necklace olfactory receptors using genetic screens that identified molecules that could be chemoreceptors. Surprisingly, they found no GPCRs. Without that hook, which had been used to uncover all currently known mammalian odorant receptors, they instead looked for proteins that spanned the membrane, reaching out of the cell to detect odors and into the cell to communicate a message that would serve as a signal to the brain. In addition, they speculated that necklace chemoreceptors would be encoded by genes that evolved quickly. When the researchers landed likely chemoreceptor candidates, they tested them to see if they could detect a variety of chemicals. To their surprise, mouse pheromones and long-chain, unsaturated fatty acids a major ingredient in sunflower seeds, nuts and other requirements of the mouse diet produced the most robust responses. ""I think the odorant ligands that we found represent some of the features these receptors have evolved to detect,"" said Bear. ""We don't know for sure what the biologically relevant sources of these molecules are, but that's one of the things that we're interested in figuring out now."" Datta said it remains unknown whether the system they discovered is a general-purpose detector of chemical cues; that is, it detects cues inside and outside the body. He is also interested in understanding how the brain interprets information that's coming toward it from the olfactory necklace system. Don't Miss: Researchers dispute claim that humans can distinguish 1 trillion odors ""This system violates the logic used by the rest of the olfactory system, so the brain must be doing something special with the information,"" he said. ""We don't know what this is, but we are very excited to peer into the brain and figure that out."" Because this receptor family is also present in humans, this work suggests that the newly identified receptors may mediate chemical communication between people and the environment, an intriguing possibility that is also being investigated.

That same nerve also detects nutrients and controls digestion. The vagus has long been recognized as a remarkable internal sensory system, regulating breathing and heart rate among other functions. Yet how it receives the information it uses to perform these tasks has been less well-known. To trigger that feeling of fullness, does just one wire need to be activated, or are there several that need to be activated? How is this sensory system organized to distinguish proteins from carbohydrates or lipids, and then how does it send messages to secrete enzymes that will digest each of them? Learn More: Body s good fat tissue communicates with brain through sensory nerves, researchers find Peering into the gut-brain connection in mice, Harvard Medical School  (HMS) researchers led by Stephen Liberles discovered two distinct types of sensory neurons that survey the status of the gastrointestinal tract: one senses stretch in the stomach and one responds to the presence of nutrients in the intestine. Their findings, published in the journal Cell, have potential relevance for understanding how bariatric surgery not only achieves weight loss but also diminishes Type 2 diabetes. In addition to weight loss, the work may be relevant for disorders of intestinal motility, such as dyspepsia.  Using genetic tools, we were able to classify two major cell types that differentially innervate the GI tract,  said Liberles, HMS associate professor of cell biology and senior author of the paper.  One cell type broadly accounts for several classes of stretch receptors in the stomach and intestine. Another cell type is completely different, detecting nutrients. The neurons that sense stretch in the stomach produce receptors for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone released from the intestine in response to the arrival of nutrients. GLP-1 analogs are powerful anti-diabetic drugs. While it might seem likely that neurons containing the GLP-1 receptor would respond to nutrients, the team s experiments instead showed they were sensitive to mechanical stretch of the stomach and the intestine. Don't Miss: How the gut feeling shapes fear These neurons, the researchers found, project to the muscular wall of the stomach but not to the inner surface of the intestine where nutrient detection occurs.  That really caught our eye,  said Rui Chang, HMS research fellow in cell biology and co-first author of the paper. Nutrients are detected by GPR65 neurons, which express receptors for the hormone serotonin. Specific in purpose, these neurons sense nutrients that travel through the intestine through projections that end in the intestinal villi, tiny peninsulas that line the intestine and aid in food absorption. The GPR65 neurons held another surprise: They respond to all sorts of chemical cues from food in the intestine, whether that cue is a sugar or fat or protein or salt or a change in pH balance.  Here you have one neuron informing the brain on just about everything,  Liberles said,  which is a much less specific role than we were expecting going in.  Also unexpected was the finding that the two nerve cell types project to different regions within the same nucleus in the brain stem. See Also: Taste sensors in fly legs control feeding The two types form non-overlapping projection fields right next to each other, suggesting that each type sends information to different circuits in the brain,  said Erika Williams, an HMS graduate student in cell biology.  They are engaging different brain pathways and presumably then orchestrating different, multi-organ physiological responses.  Liberles said there might be pharmaceutical targets for the regulation of food intake, perhaps the receptors that modulate responses to nutrients.  The tools we used optogenetics, imaging, and neural mapping allowed us to paint a comprehensive picture of what these neurons do,  said Liberles.  That capability could in future studies help us understand how these neurons work at a molecular level: What are the key receptors that detect stretch of the stomach or nutrients in the intestine, or even other sensory cues outside the GI tract.

It is thus not surprising that altered progranulin levels represent a universal theme shared across several common neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, for instance, reduced brain levels of progranulin contribute to the specific amyloid disease pathology, while increased levels appear to protect against this pathology. In genetic forms of another type of dementia, namely frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progranulin levels can be reduced. As progranulin can be measured relatively easily in blood, it seemed that a promising new biomarker for types of dementia has now been found. In fact, treatments were proposed to increase progranulin levels, aiming to yield a therapeutic effect for many neurodegenerative diseases. It was suggested to take progranulin in blood as a measure of response for these future treatments. See Also: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression Carlo Wilke and Matthis Synofzik from the Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research & German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), T bingen, Germany, have now shown that, unfortunately, the full story of progranulin is not that simple. The levels of progranulin in blood do not correlate with the levels of progranulin in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain neither in Alzheimer's disease or in frontotemporal dementia, nor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). But it is the brain where these neurodegenerative diseases actually take place. It seems that the progranulin levels around the brain are regulated by different mechanisms than the progranulin levels in the body periphery, e.g. in blood. These findings shed new light on the understanding of the biological processes underlying neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease and other common neurodegenerative diseases.

The answer: Hope for patients with epilepsy that their seizures can be reliably predicted, and perhaps prevented. A study published in the June issue of the journal Brain reports on a 2014 online contest in which more than 500 teams of data scientists from all over the world analyzed hundreds of hours of recordings of electrical activity in the brains of two people and five dogs before and during epileptic seizures. See Also: Important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures found The contest result? The wisdom of the crowd created a better-than-random prediction of epileptic seizures. In what has long been a highly contentious field of research, with limited reproducibility of results, this study has made all the data and analysis code freely available. For patients, predictability of seizures could be life changing. ""If an algorithm could detect subtle changes in the electrical activity of a person's brain before a seizure occurs, people with epilepsy could take medications only when needed and possibly reclaim the daily activities many of us take for granted,"" says Ben Brinkmann, PhD, a data scientist at Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study by Mayo Clinic, University of Pennsylvania and University of Minnesota. During seizures, abnormal electrical activity in the brain sometimes results in loss of consciousness. For people with epilepsy, the unpredictability of seizures severely limits their ability to perform tasks where even a momentary loss of consciousness could prove disastrous driving a car, swimming or holding an infant, for example. Approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, according to the World Health Organization. Development of reliable seizure prediction algorithms requires data on many seizures and non-seizure brain activity as measured by implanted electroencephalography (EEG). But the large quantities of long-duration data needed are difficult to acquire and have not been available. Typically, EEG recordings lasting seven days or fewer are taken before surgery when a patient's medications are reduced to encourage seizures. These recordings offer a limited view of brain function under changing conditions. Even when a working algorithm is created, investigators typically don't share algorithm code because of concerns related to privacy, cost of sharing large datasets, protecting their research and intellectual property. There is also a lack of incentives to share data. The result is a vast literature that is difficult to compare and impossible to reproduce. Enter crowdsourcing and data sharing. If, as the old adage says, two heads are better than one, then crowdsourcing goes the next step by seeking online help from a large group of people to solve a problem. ""In the hope of winning up to $15,000 in prize money and bragging rights in data science circles, hundreds of algorithm developers, most with little or no experience with epilepsy or EEG, worked countless hours to build, test and rebuild algorithms for seizure forecasting,"" Dr. Brinkmann says. Don't Miss: Marijuana derivative reduces seizures in people with treatment-resistant epilepsy The novel data from canines with epilepsy were obtained with the Seizure Advisory System developed by Seattle-based NeuroVista Corp., an early-stage medical device company that folded in 2014. The datasets and source code remain openly available from the Mayo Clinic Systems Electrophysiology Lab and the International Epilepsy Electrophysiology Portal for researchers to continue developing new algorithms for predicting seizures. ""These results support our effort to develop the next generation of epilepsy devices designed to continuously monitor brain activity, forecast and prevent seizures,"" says neurologist Greg Worrell, MD, PhD, Mayo Clinic. ""These datasets and source code also serve as a benchmark, allowing new algorithms to be compared to each other and to the algorithms developed in this competition."" ""This is an incredibly dynamic and powerful way to do community research and bring new minds into the challenge of epilepsy,"" says Brian Litt, MD, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. ""I think this effort highlights the potential of medical devices that quantify disease burden over clinically meaningful time frames,"" says Kent Leyde, former chief technology officer of NeuroVista. ""Long-term records, such as those collected by the NeuroVista system, help us better understand the disease process, and their availability provides a basis for collaborating with experts from other fields to devise new methods to treat and manage disease."" The approach would not be possible without making the data openly available. Data scientists from across the globe tested algorithms on nearly 350 seizures recorded over more than 1,500 days and the winners agreed to make their computer code freely available. During the four-month contest, over half of these crowdsourced algorithms performed better than random predictions. The best performing algorithms accurately predicted more than 70 percent of seizures when tested on unseen portions of the canine data.

It is interested in detecting and understanding damage in cells and tissues due to ionizing radiation used in cancer treatments. Currently the dose a patient receives is prescribed based on population averages and does not take individual patient radio sensitivity into account. The ultimate aim of the group is to help personalize prescriptions based on an individual's response to radiation.  In some cases, it is possible to use Raman spectroscopic techniques to detect radiation damage in patients. The group is conducting research to find out if it is possible to make an early detection tool based on Raman spectroscopy, either prior to first treatment or within the first few fractions of treatment.  Associate Professor, Andrew Jirasek, is a physicist by training who has specialised in how to accurately measure radiation treatments for cancer patients. Together with his colleagues, Dr Jirasek was the first to apply Raman spectroscopy to look at the unique cellular changes that occur following radiation. He says.  This is a very powerful technique. We can record and analyse information about how the molecules and cellular constituents change throughout treatment.  Dosage can then be adjusted to be more precise and targeted. He continues,  Previously, the only outcome of treatment was disease status; for example, tumour size. Our hope is that Raman analysis will provide accurate treatment evaluation sooner. Like many other diseases, timing with cancer treatment is everything. The sooner successful therapy is implemented, the better for the patient.  After conducting cell and animal model experiments, the group is now at the point of testing the system on prostate cancer patients.  Describing the choice of the Renishaw inVia Raman microscope for this work, Dr Jirasek said,  We chose the inVia for multiple reasons. The system delivers excellent Raman sensitivity and throughput. It also offers us high potential for automation. Because the system is used by multiple groups and types of users, ease of use is important to maximise our  up time . With several users not being experts in Raman, we have appreciated the excellent customer service support we have had from Renishaw.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/poverty-marks-a-gene-predicting-depression-205738,Poverty Marks a Gene  Predicting Depression New study of high risk teens reveals a biological pathway for depression  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A long line of research links poverty and depression. Now, a study by Duke University scientists shows how biology might underlie the depression experienced by high-risk adolescents whose families are socio-economically disadvantaged.  The study combined genetics, brain imaging and behavioral data gathered as adolescents were followed for more than three years as part of a larger study. The results are part of a growing body of work that may lead to biological predictors that could guide individualized depression-prevention strategies. Adolescents growing up in households with lower socioeconomic status were shown to accumulate greater quantities of a chemical tag on a depression-linked gene over the course of two years. These  epigenetic  tags work by altering the activity of genes. The more chemical tags an individual had near a gene called SLC6A4, the more responsive was their amygdala -- a brain area that coordinates the body s reactions to threat -- to photographs of fearful faces as they underwent functional MRI brain scans. Participants with a more active amygdala were more likely to later report symptoms of depression.  This is some of the first research to demonstrating that low socioeconomic status can lead to changes in the way genes are expressed, and it maps this out through brain development to the future experience of depression symptoms,  said the study s first author Johnna Swartz, a Duke postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Ahmad Hariri, a Duke professor of psychology and neuroscience. Adolescence is rarely an easy time for anyone. But growing up in a family with low socioeconomic status or SES -- a metric that incorporates parents  income and education levels -- can add chronic stressors such as family discord and chaos, and environmental risks such as poor nutrition and smoking.  These small daily hassles of scraping by are evident in changes that build up and affect children s development,  Swartz said.  The study included 132 non-Hispanic Caucasian adolescents in the Teen Alcohol Outcomes Study (TAOS) who were between 11 and 15 years old at the outset of the study and came from households that ranged from low to high SES. About half of the participants had a family history of depression.   The biggest risk factor we have currently for depression is a family history of the disorder,  said study co-author Douglas Williamson, principal investigator of TAOS and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke.  Our new work reveals one of the mechanisms by which such familial risk may be manifested or expressed in a particular group of vulnerable individuals during adolescence.  The group s previous work, published last year in the journal Neuron, had shown that fMRI scan activity of the amygdala could signal who is more likely to experience depression and anxiety in response to stress several years later. That study included healthy college-aged participants of Hariri s ongoing Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS), which aims to link genes, brain activity, and other biological markers to a risk for mental illness. This study asked whether higher activity in the same brain area could predict depression in the younger, at-risk TAOS participants. Indeed, about one year later, these individuals (now between 14 and 19 years of age) were more likely to report symptoms of depression, especially if they had a family history of the disorder. Swartz said the new study examined a range of socioeconomic status and did not focus specifically on families affected by extreme poverty or neglect. She said the findings suggest that even modestly lower socioeconomic status is associated with biological differences that elevate adolescents  risk for depression. Most of the team s work so far has focused on epigenetic chemical tags near the SLC6A4 gene because it helps control the brain s levels of serotonin, a neurochemical involved in clinical depression and other mood disorders. The more marks present just upstream of this gene, the less likely it is to be active.  In 2014, Williamson and Hariri first showed that the presence of marks near the SLC6A4 gene can predict the way a person s amygdala responds to threat. That study included both Williamson s TAOS and Hariri s DNS participants, but had looked at the chemical tags at a single point in time.  Looking at the changes in these markers over an extended time is a more powerful way to understand an individual s risk for depression, said Hariri, who is also a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. The team is now searching the genome for new markers that would predict depression. Ultimately, a panel of markers used in combination will lead to more accurate predictions, Swartz said.  They also hope to expand the age ranges of the study to include younger individuals and to continue following the TAOS participants into young adulthood.  As they enter into young adulthood they are going to be experiencing more problems with depression or anxiety -- or maybe substance abuse,  Hariri said.  The extent to which our measures of their genomes and brains earlier in their lives continue to predict their relative health is something that s very important to know and very exciting for us to study.

Around 8,800 people in the UK are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year. It is known as the UK s deadliest cancer, with a survival rate of just 3 per cent.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone are relatively unsuccessful in treating the disease, and while surgery to remove the tumour offers the best chance of survival, most patients are diagnosed when the cancer has already spread to other organs. A new approach is needed to target the cancer more effectively. Cancer cells are surrounded by other cells called  stromal cells , which can make up 80 per cent of pancreatic cancer tissue. These relatively normal tissue cells communicate with the cancer cells and play a major role in cancer progression, and could offer a new target for treatment. The study, in cell cultures and mice, tested a new approach of targeting stromal cells and cancer cells simultaneously. By using  gemcitabine  chemotherapy to target cancer cells, and a form of vitamin A to target the surrounding stromal cells, the combined approach led to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Lead researcher Professor Hemant Kocher from QMUL s Barts Cancer Institute said:  This is the first time that we have combined vitamin A with chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. The results are so promising that we re now taking this into a clinical trial.  Pancreatic cancer is extremely hard to treat by chemotherapy, so this finding is important because vitamin A targets the non-cancerous tissue and makes the existing chemotherapy more effective, killing the cancer cells and shrinking tumours.  This could potentially be applicable to other cancers because if we try to understand the cancer as a whole, including its surrounding tissue, we may be able to develop new and better treatments.  Targeting stromal cells as well as the cancer cells blocks multiple cell signalling pathways that are used by cancer cells to become aggressive. This means that the cancer cells are no longer able to communicate as effectively and the tumour does not grow as it otherwise would. The new approach is now being tested in a clinical trial, STARPAC, led from Barts Cancer Institute s Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine. The trial hopes to establish a safe combination of two chemotherapy medications with a stromal targeting agent and is currently recruiting participants. QMUL PhD student Elisabete Carapu a added:  The majority of experimental work was done as part of my PhD project, and I am excited that our hard work in the laboratory is now being tested in the form of a clinical trial. We hope that it will benefit patients facing this awful disease.  This study was funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council s Knowledge Transfer Network, the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund, Cancer Research UK and Barts Charity. The STARPAC clinical trial is funded by the Medical Research Council and supported by Celgene Sarl Inc. Patients should note that consumption of Vitamin A supplements is not recommended at this stage, as the results are not proven in human clinical trials.","Published: May 26, 2016"

Triclosan seems to be everywhere. When we wash our hands, brush our teeth, or do our laundry, we are likely putting triclosan into our water sources. Triclosan is in antibacterial soaps, detergents, carpets, paints, toys, and toothpaste. These products can feel comforting to germ-wary consumers. However, these products are only slightly better at removing bacteria than regular soap and water. And in antibacterial soaps, triclosan may not add any benefit to removing bacteria compared to regular soap and water. The problem with triclosan is that it kills both good and bad bacteria. Studies also show that it contributes to medically necessary antibiotics becoming less effective. Triclosan is also toxic to algae and disrupts hormones in animals. This can hamper normal animal development. The FDA is currently investigating its impact on humans. Most of the triclosan is removed in waste water treatment plants. However, a U.S. Geological Survey found the antibacterial in nearly 58% of freshwater streams.  What you use has an impact even though you re probably not thinking about it,  says Monica Mendez. Mendez is an associate professor in the Department of Biology and Chemistry at Texas A&M International University. She is interested in triclosan-contaminated streams and rivers. These streams often serve as the water source for crops.  If a river happens to be a source of irrigation, could triclosan possibly get into our food?  Mendez wonders. Mendez and her colleagues wanted to understand what happens to soils and plants watered with triclosan-contaminated water. They intentionally watered onions, tomatoes, and bare soils with triclosan-contaminated water in a long-term study. After months of monitoring, they found triclosan in all edible portions of the tomato and onion plants. Fortunately, the amount they detected was safe for human consumption. They also discovered that although the triclosan degraded quickly in the soil, it never completely disappeared. This contributes to a second problem. As triclosan breaks down, it can turn into other compounds that may be even more harmful. The breakdown of triclosan produces more effective hormone disruptors.   It s not just triclosan that we re interested in,  says Mendez,  We also want to understand the possible products as degradation occurs. There s still a lot of research that needs to be done.   Mendez is also concerned about how triclosan affects the bacteria that support plant growth in the soil. Triclosan targets all bacteria, not just disease-causing bacteria. Soils with healthy and diverse bacteria tend to be better for plants. However, triclosan can harm these microbial communities.  We know that triclosan decreases the diversity of bacterial communities,  says Mendez,  But we still need to figure out which good bacteria we are losing.  Mendez s study was the first to measure the long-term, repeated effects of triclosan on soil and plant communities. She hopes that further studies will track its impact on microbial communities.  Because we re all concerned about disease-causing bacteria, we generally ignore what happens below ground,  Mendez says.  Water and soil come together. We need to look at the quality of both, because food is important. ","Published: May 26, 2016"

HIV is truly an expert at living large on a small budget,  says first author Yang Luo, a postdoc at ADARC and a former graduate student at Rockefeller University.  We asked the question, how does such a compact virus manipulate the host cell to gain entry and replicate itself, all while escaping the immune system?  Mapping HIV s  interactome  The study focused on two viral proteins known to bring about HIV s infection of human white blood cells. The first one, called envelope or Env, sits on the surface of the virus and, by binding to receptors on the host cell, helps the membrane that encapsulates the virus fuse with the cell s outer membrane. A second protein, Vif, destroys an enzyme that host cells produce to defend themselves against the virus. In an effort to better understand how these two proteins function, the team wanted to map their interactome meaning all the proteins with which they associate within a host cell. To accomplish this, the researchers needed to devise a way to isolate clusters of interacting proteins from cells during different stages of infection. Such experiments can be done by introducing a genetic sequence into the viral genome a  tag  that acts like a piece of molecular Velcro, allowing one viral protein to be yanked out along with all the other proteins associated with it. It sounds simple, but making it work took a decade.  Inserting a tag sequence into small viruses is a challenge to begin with,  says corresponding author Mark Muesing, a principal investigator at ADARC.  If you disrupt their nucleic acid and protein sequences, you can easily compromise the virus s ability to replicate. And HIV represents a particular challenge because it can quickly revert back to its original sequence.   We developed a technique to find places in the HIV genome where we can insert stable tags without affecting the virus s capacity to proliferate. In effect, this allowed us to expand cultures of the infected cells along with the tagged viral protein,  he adds. The host s contribution Next, the researchers infected human cells with viruses carrying the tagged protein sequences, and were able to pull out and identify a large number of host proteins directly during the infectious process. This provided the first evidence that many previously underappreciated host proteins interact with the viral machinery during replication.  Imagine you have a factory assembly line where only one component of, say, the stamping machine, actually touches the product,  says co-author Michael Rout, professor and head of Rockefeller s Laboratory of Cellular and Structural Biology.  Other parts support and power the stamp. Likewise, within an infected cell, we can identify the components of a particular cellular machine, not just the piece that comes in contact with the viral protein.   Every host protein we pull out generates new questions,  adds co-first author Erica Jacobs, a research associate in Brian Chait s lab.  Does it help the virus invade and co-opt the host to replicate itself? Or does it harm it? The answers will not only help us understand the virus, but also shed light on our cells  ability to defend themselves.  One important discovery has already emerged from the lists of proteins. Viruses, including HIV, often attack as so-called virions, which are individual packets of protein and genetic code. But they can also pass directly from an infected to an uninfected cell, a more effective mode of transmission. To do so, the virus appears to use host proteins to construct a platform, a close junctional surface, between cells. From the list of proteins that interact with Env, the researchers have identified cellular proteins predicted to contribute to this platform between cells. Because this route of transmission protects the virus in a sequestered environment, away from host defenses, the new findings may aid in the development of future anti-HIV therapies. A live infection, step by step According to co-author Brian Chait, Camille and Henry Dreyfus Professor and head of the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, the new approach offers a rare glimpse into the process by which HIV invades and resurrects itself within a cell.  Often, studies of this sort are done with viral proteins in the absence of a true viral infection,  says Chait.  However, because viral infections are exquisitely orchestrated events, you are likely to miss all kinds of important details if you study the action of these proteins out of their proper context.   Deciphering the intricacies of virus host protein interactions in space and time during the progression of an infection is remarkably powerful,  says co-author Ileana Cristea, an associate professor of molecular biology at Princeton University.  The challenge is to discover which precise interactions are the critical ones.  Todd Greco, a co-first author, and an associate research scholar and lecturer in molecular biology in Cristea s lab, says that  even for host proteins within the same family, their relative stability within HIV-1 protein complexes can be very different. More broadly, by understanding these mechanisms we will better understand the coordinated responses of cells. ","Published: May 26, 2016"

A major, decade-long study of thousands of Americans  found that people living in areas with more outdoor pollution  even at lower levels common in the United States   accumulate deposits in the arteries that supply the heart faster than do people living in less polluted areas.   Previous epidemiological studies have shown associations between particle pollution, refered to as particulate matter, and heart disease. It has been unclear, however, how exposure to particulate matter leads to diseases of the cardiovascular system. Earlier studies had been shorter and had depended for their analysis on existing datasets collected for other purposes.  Now, direct evidence from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air), a 10-year epidemiological study of more than 6,000 people from six U.S. states, shows that air pollution   even at levels below regulatory standards   accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis.  The condition, also called hardening of the arteries, can cause heart attacks. Researchers repeatedly measured calcium deposits in the heart s arteries by using CT scans.  They also assessed each person s exposure to pollution based on home address.   The study provides important new information on how pollution affects the main biological process that leads to heart disease,  said Dr. Joel Kaufman, who directs MESA Air and is the lead author of the published paper. He is a University of Washington professor of environmental and occupational health sciences, and also a UW professor of epidemiology, and of medicine.  The evidence supports worldwide efforts to reduce exposures to ambient air pollutants,  Kaufman said.  He added,  This was the most in-depth study of air pollution exposures ever applied to a large study group specifically designed to examine influences on cardiovascular health.  The researchers calculated each participant s exposure to ambient fine particulate matter that is less than 2.5 microns in diameter and too small to be seen by the naked eye.  In addition to PM2.5, they also measured exposure to nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, and black carbon or soot. The research team collected thousands of air pollution measurements in the study participants  communities and at their homes. The research team developed and applied computational models that included local information on land use, roadway and traffic volumes, weather conditions, and local sources of air pollution. These models could generate accurate pollution concentrations at each person s home.  Meanwhile, between the years 2000 and 2012, participants visited study clinics several times to undergo CT scanning to determine the amount of calcium deposits in their heart arteries. Results were strongest for fine particulate matter and the traffic-related pollutant gases called oxides of nitrogen.  The study found that for every 5  g/m3 higher concentration of PM2.5, or 35 parts per billion  higher concentration of oxides of nitrogen   about the difference between more and less polluted areas of a U.S. metropolitan area   individuals had a 4 Agatston units/year faster rate of progression of coronary artery calcium scores.  This is about a 20 percent acceleration in the rate of these calcium deposits.   The effects were seen even in the United States where efforts to reduce exposure have been notably successful compared with many other parts of the world,  Kaufman said.  Exposures were low when compared to U.S. ambient air quality standards, which permit an annual average PM2.5 concentration of 12  g/m3.  The participants in this MESA-Air study experienced concentrations between 9.2 and 22.6  g/m3.","Published: May 26, 2016"

We need phenylalanine hydroxylase to control levels of phenylalanine in the blood because too much is toxic to the brain,  said Steve Meisburger, lead author on the study and a post-doctoral researcher in the Ando lab. Genetic mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase can lead to disorders such as phenylketonuria, an inherited condition that can cause intellectual and behavioral disabilities unless detected at birth and managed through dietary restrictions. Published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the article presented detailed structural data on the enzyme's active state   the shape it adopts when performing its chemical duties   that has eluded scientists for years.  It s a floppy enzyme which means it s dynamic,  said Nozomi Ando, an assistant professor of chemistry at Princeton and corresponding author on the paper.  That also means it doesn t like to crystallize,  she said. This is problematic for the classic method used to study enzymatic structure, known as x-ray crystallography, which requires solid crystal samples. Efforts to crystallize phenylalanine hydroxylase have just recently met success, but still only captured the enzyme in its inactive state. The researchers in the Ando lab were able to bypass the tricky task of growing crystals of the active enzyme by using their expertise in a special technique akin to crystallography, called small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), which allows scientists to study enzymes in a solution. And because the enzyme is susceptible to aggregation or clumping up in solution, the researchers coupled their scattering   method with a purification technique called size exclusion chromatography (SEC), in which different species in a sample flow through a column at different speeds based on their size.  Pairing SEC with SAXS is an emergent technique. Our contribution is that we saw a clever way to use it,  Ando said. The experiment is highly specialized and relies on powerful x-rays emitted by particles speeding around the circular track at a synchrotron facility. The research team traveled from Princeton to the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source in Ithaca, New York, for multiple intensive data-collection sessions.  Any time on the machine that is available, we use it. Not a single photon gets wasted,  Ando said. As the enzyme solution passes through the purification technique, flowing across the path of the x-ray beam, researchers record snapshots of the x-ray scattering patterns. The resulting dataset is quite complex as the sample also contains phenylalanine, the compound that  turns on  phenylalanine hydroxylase so that researchers can catch the dynamic enzyme in action.    Current approaches for analyzing this type of dataset are very crude,  Meisburger said. Essentially, these methods assume that each signal   known as an elution peak   represents a single species, when each peak is actually a mixture of species. In this work, the team used an advanced linear algebra method known as evolving factor analysis that allowed them to separate the scattering components.  We can use these linear algebra methods to  un-mix  species that are overlapping,  Meisburger said,  That s the piece that I think is really exciting.  By applying their unique approach, the researchers were able to provide evidence for a model of the active structure of phenylalanine hydroxylase that builds upon recent work by their collaborators in Paul Fitzpatrick s group at UT Health Science Center at San Antonio. In this model, two phenylalanine molecules dock to a pair of sites on the enzyme, bringing a pair of arms together and freeing up the active sites for doing chemistry once more phenylalanine molecules come along.  I m very proud that this is our first paper [published since Ando joined the faculty at Princeton]. We wanted it to be very quantitative and heavy on the biochemistry plus heavy on the physical chemistry. I m really pleased with the way it turned out,  Ando said.","Published: May 26, 2016"

Within each center, scientists will partner with community organizations to study these concerns and develop culturally appropriate ways to reduce exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The Centers of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research are jointly funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), and the National Center for Environmental Research at EPA. The new centers, funded by five-year grants, are an expansion of a successful pilot program originally started by NIMHD and EPA. The centers will examine a range of stressors on health, including air, water, and ground pollution as well as environmental conditions such as sub-standard housing, poor diet, and adverse social dynamics.  More than a decade of NIH research has shown that low-income, minority and tribal communities experience higher levels of environmental pollution in the United States, and that these populations often have poorer health,  said Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D., NIEHS director.  It is important to understand modifiable influences on health, such as environmental, behavioral, and lifestyle changes, so that we can improve health and well-being.  Community partners will collaborate with scientists to define research questions, recruit study participants, and collect data. Additionally, partners will help translate research results into strategies to address existing health issues and prevent harmful exposures.  This joint effort between the NIH and EPA is an important step in stimulating research to identify how complex interactions between social, natural, biological, and built environments influence health of vulnerable populations,  said Eliseo Perez-Stable, M.D., NIMHD director.  The knowledge gained from this research will provide critical information to alleviate environmentally driven health disparities and improve the health of those that are impacted.  The new centers are as follows Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, led by Francine Laden, Sc.D., and Jonathan Levy, Sc.D., will study how housing conditions may affect birth weight, childhood growth trajectories, and risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and whether improved urban housing may benefit health.

In February 2016, TxCell achieved the key milestone in the transfer of its manufacturing technology to MaSTherCell   the successful conduct of a series of contractually defined validation runs of Ovasave  at MaSTherCell s site. TxCell is therefore preparing to resume CATS29 as soon as possible. Topline data are expected within 18 to 21 months of trial resumption.  Obtaining the authorization to restart our Phase IIb study in refractory Crohn s patients as per the timeline announced mid-2015 is an important milestone for TxCell,  said St phane Boissel, CEO of TxCell.  TxCell has made major internal structural changes over the past year. These decisions include the reacquisition of the full rights to Ovasave , the decision to outsource our manufacturing activities, the appointment of MaSTherCell and PCT as our CMOs in Europe and in the US respectively and the start of ENTrIA, TxCell s second platform, based on CAR-Treg cells. TxCell is now entirely focused on value-added activities in a new chapter for the company. With the CATS29 study, TxCell should obtain important controlled clinical data that will help us to position both our lead product as well as TxCell s wider technology for the treatment of severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.  The CATS29 clinical study aims primarily at comparing Ovasave  at the 106 dose vs. placebo. The objective is to achieve a response rate of 70% in the experimental arm vs. 30% in the control arm. 56 patients with moderate to severe refractory Crohn s disease will be evaluated. The patients will be recruited in 29 clinical centers in 6 European countries. The 32-week treatment will be split into two phases: firstly an 8-week blinded phase, where patients will receive at week 0 either placebo or Ovasave  106 (randomized 1:1) and secondly a 24-week unblinded phase, where all patients will receive Ovasave  106 (three further open label 2 injections at 8-week intervals). TxCell now plans to amend its US IND (Investigational New Drug) accordingly. The CATS29 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met ahead of the VHP approval to review all available data on previously treated patients, as well as updates on the study design and plans for the resumption of the study.

While changes may not be severe enough to disrupt daily life, a clinical diagnosis of MCI indicates an increased risk of eventually developing Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia. See Also: Coffee consumption habits impact the risk of mild cognitive impairment In a paper published in the current Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System say existing screening tools for MCI result in a false-negative error rate of more than 7 percent. These persons are misclassified as not having MCI based on standard screening instruments, but actually do have MCI when more extensive testing is conducted. ""There are consequences to misdiagnosis,"" said first author Emily C. Edmonds, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow of neuropsychology in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ""At the individual level, people incorrectly identified as cognitively normal might not receive appropriate medical advice or treatment. This could include preventive measures, such as diet or lifestyle changes to maintain cognitive function, or a referral to other health care providers."" Beyond that, Edmonds said diagnostic errors can also negatively impact research studies of MCI and early Alzheimer's disease. ""If research participants are misclassified when they enroll in a study, this can weaken the study's results, which makes it even more difficult to find and develop effective treatments or therapies."" Current diagnostic criteria for MCI, which are broadly used, rely upon subjective memory complaints by the person being screened, a single test score indicating impaired memory, and clinical judgment. Study authors say this approach can produce significant errors in diagnosis. They noted that their past research has also shown a high rate of ""false-positives,"" which are errors in the opposite direction. ""False-positives"" are when people are classified as having MCI based on standard diagnostic criteria, but they do not actually have it upon further testing. ""We have previously found that as many as one-third of MCI cases diagnosed with the standard method are false-positive errors,"" said Edmonds. ""This, coupled with our recent finding of a 7 percent false-negative error rate, is concerning and tells us that the diagnostic criteria could be improved."" Researchers examined data from 520 individuals participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a nationwide, multi-institution study of MCI and Alzheimer's Disease. All of the participants, almost evenly split by gender with a mean age of 74.3 years, underwent standard MCI screening and a more in-depth diagnostic process that involved additional memory and learning tests. Learn More: MRI technique detects evidence of cognitive decline before symptoms appear Thirty-seven individuals (7.1 percent) were identified as cognitively normal based on standard criteria, but qualified for MCI diagnosis using the more comprehensive testing. In addition to mildly impaired cognitive performance, they showed tell-tale biomarkers in their cerebrospinal fluid indicating they are at-risk for future dementia. The remaining participants tested normal using both methods - a true-negative rate of 92.9 percent. The findings, concluded the authors, show that the use of rigorous diagnostic criteria that include formal neuropsychological tests and less reliance on standard screening methods for MCI can improve clinical research studies and better predict who is likely to progress from MCI to dementia.

The progressive disorder typically strikes adults in mid-life. In many cases, the spread of the disease to other brain areas leads to Parkinson's disease dementia, characterized by deterioration of memory, reason, attention and planning. In new research, Travis Dunckley, PhD, a researcher at Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute, examines genetic modifications associated with the development of PD and PD-associated dementia, bringing new investigative tools to bear. See Also: Study confirms Parkinson's enhances creativity The research, which appears in the current issue of the journal Neurology Genetics, uses RNA sequencing to illuminate two phenomena linked with the onset of Parkinson's disease, differential gene expression and alternative splicing of genes. The study tracks specific gene alterations implicated in the development of Parkinson's, noting that gene expression and alternative splicing offer complementary information critical to a full understanding of disease progression. The findings deepen the scientific understanding of the disease, while suggesting new avenues for more comprehensive diagnosis. ""This work shows that the degeneration of key functional brain areas in Parkinson's disease is more genetically complex than previously appreciated,"" Dunckley says. ""Very small changes in the way in which genes are processed, not just large changes in which genes are turned on or off, can contribute to Parkinson's disease."" Dr. Dunckley is a researcher in the newly formed Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center (NDRC), a unique partnership between Arizona State University, and Banner Health. The research alliance focuses on advancing the scientific study, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's disease affects roughly 1 percent of those over 50 years old, with the incidence markedly increasing with age. Presently, there is no cure for the disease, though medication and surgery may be used to help manage some of the symptoms. Neurons located in the substantia nigra region of the brain are the primary target for Parkinson's disease. Some of these neurons produce dopamine, which decreases as the illness advances, causing deterioration of normal movement. Don't Miss: Finnish study establishes connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant alternative splicing have all been implicated in the trajectory of Parkinson's disease, though precise causes of the illness involving the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons in the mid-brain accompanied by high rates of dementia remain murky. The main symptoms of PD are tremor of the hands, arms, legs, jaw and face; bradykinesia (or slowness of movement); stiffness and rigidity of the limbs and trunk and impaired balance and coordination. Cell losses in other brain regions, including the brain stem and olfactory bulb, have also been implicated in Parkinson's. The primary neurological hallmark of the disease is the formation of so-called Lewy bodies microscopic aggregates of a protein known as  -synuclein. Lewy bodies are involved in other neurological disorders as well, including dementia with Lewy bodies. Evidence suggests that dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia may all be related to abnormalities in brain processing of  -synuclein. In the past decade, the study of gene expression has rapidly advanced, due in part to the successful sequencing of the human genome. A suite of technologies known as next-generation sequencing permits low-cost, rapid sequencing of DNA and RNA, revolutionizing the study of genomics and molecular biology. Genetic correlates of Parkinson's disease have recently been investigated, though the mechanisms associated with cellular degeneration remain poorly understood. In the current study, RNA sequencing was used to evaluate differential gene expression the brain's posterior cingulate cortex, using samples from neurologically normal brains, those with Parkinson's disease and patients with Parkinson's dementia. Post-mortem samples from the posterior cingulate cortex were acquired from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain Bank. Related: Tissue biomarker for dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease identified A number of genes were found to be overexpressed in the two disease states when compared with normal controls. Intriguingly, some overexpressed genes play a role in immune function while genes responsible for cell signaling or in the makeup of the cell's structural support network (known as the cytoskeleton) were underexpressed in those with Parkinson's. The study reports on the top 20 differentially expressed genes in PD and PD dementia, comparing these with healthy controls. Genes showing overexpression included those involved with cell movement, receptor binding, cell signaling and ion homeostasis. Underexpressed genes shared an involvement with hormone signaling. Existing studies of gene expression in Parkinson's patients however may not tell the whole story of genetic pathology. Alternative splicing of genes, observed in the new research, may also be a critical factor. Applying information on alternative splicing as well as differential gene expression provides a more nuanced picture of how Parkinson's disease damages the brain and produces the symptoms typically observed. Previous studies have implicated genetic aberrations with Parkinson's disease, particularly mutations in a gene known as LRRK2. The new study additionally evaluates splicing variants potentially involved with Parkinson's. Alternative splicing occurs during gene expression and permits a single gene to code for multiple proteins. In this process, pieces of the gene, known as exons, may be included within or excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that gene. The resulting proteins translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs will contain different amino acid sequences and, often, altered biological functions. Alternative splicing allows the human genome to produce far more proteins than would be expected from its roughly 20,000 protein-coding genes. Credit: Public Domain  Alternative splicing is a common mechanism of gene control, permitting a single gene to code for multiple proteins. The process often occurs when segments of the DNA sequence in a gene known as exons are skipped over during the process of transcribing them into RNA. The alternatively spliced mRNA is then translated into protein variants, bearing different amino acid sequences. Alternative splicing occurs in around 95 percent of human genes and is responsible for an enormous expansion in nature's palette of useful proteins. The phenomenon helps to account for the staggering biological complexity and diversity in humans despite a mere 20,000 protein-coding genes. The same process of alternative splicing however can produce aberrant proteins linked with disease states, including PD. The new study reports significant alternative splicing of disease-specific genes in the cortex of patients with PD and PD dementia. In particular, the researchers examined the posterior cingulate cortex, where the spread of the PD-linked protein  -synuclein is associated with PD dementia. Learn More: MRI brain scans detect people with early Parkinson's Results showed that the genes most differentially expressed in PD are distinct from those displaying the highest degree of alternative splicing. Hence, conventional gene profiling alone omits important genetic information relevant to PD development and progression. Some of the observed alternative splicing was restricted to PD patients displaying dementia while others were associated with PD alone. Detailed analysis of alternative splicing events can reveal aberrant splicing of key disease genes. The process can drive disease progression in a number of ways. On the one hand, alternative splicing may provoke particular pathways to become overactive, contributing to disease onset or progression. Alternatively, cells in distress during the progression of PD and PD dementia may undergo altered splicing as a result of widespread dysfunction. The authors note that future research will help distinguish between these possibilities, shedding further light on this devastating illness. ""It is our hope that further clarification of the role of these newly identified gene variants in the disease process will provide new targets for treatments that may slow or halt the unrelenting brain degeneration.""

The paper evaluated nearly 1,000 cases of schizophrenia and matched controls among offspring born in Finland from 1983-1998 who were ascertained from the country's national registry. Results showed that a higher maternal nicotine level in the mother's blood was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia among their offspring. The findings persisted after adjusting for important confounding factors including maternal and parental psychiatric history, socioeconomic status, and maternal age. The study provides the most definitive evidence to date that smoking during pregnancy is associated with schizophrenia. Findings are published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. See Also: Smoking thins vital part of brain Heavy maternal nicotine exposure was associated with a 38 percent increased odds of schizophrenia. ""To our knowledge, this is the first biomarker-based study to show a relationship between fetal nicotine exposure and schizophrenia,"" said Alan Brown, MD, MPH, senior author and Mailman School professor of epidemiology and professor of clinical psychiatry at CUMC. ""We employed a nationwide sample with the highest number of schizophrenia cases to date in a study of this type."" Researchers analyzed data from a large national birth cohort of pregnant women who participated in the Finnish Prenatal Study of Schizophrenia and their offspring from the Finnish Maternity Cohort, which archived over 1 million prenatal serum specimens since 1983. Sera were drawn during the first and early second trimesters. The Finnish Hospital and Outpatient Discharge Registry was used to identify all recorded diagnoses for psychiatric hospital admissions and outpatient treatment visits. Heavy smoking based on cotinine, a reliable marker of nicotine in maternal sera, was reported by 20 percent of the mothers of cases, but only 14.7% of the mothers of controls. Smoking during pregnancy is known to contribute to significant problems in utero and following birth, including low birth weight and attentional difficulties. Nicotine readily crosses the placenta into the fetal bloodstream, specifically targets fetal brain development, causing short- and long-term changes in cognition, and potentially contributes to other neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Learn More: Neural reward response may demonstrate why quitting smoking is harder for some ""These findings underscore the value of ongoing public health education on the potentially debilitating, and largely preventable, consequences that smoking may have on children over time,"" said Brown. ""Future studies on maternal smoking and other environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors, as well as animal models, should allow identification of the biological mechanisms responsible for these associations. Finally, it is of interest to examine maternal cotinine in relation to bipolar disorder, autism, and other psychiatric disorders. In a previous study from a different birth cohort, also reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Dr. Brown and colleagues found that offspring of mothers who reported smoking during pregnancy have an increased risk of bipolar disorder.

Now, researchers from the University of Missouri (MU) School of Medicine have found evidence that anemia can negatively influence the outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injuries. ""More research is needed to develop treatment protocols for anemic patients with traumatic brain injuries,"" said N. Scott Litofsky, MD, chief of the MU School of Medicine's Division of Neurological Surgery and lead author of the study. ""Anemia occurs when there is a shortage of red blood cells, which causes reduced oxygen flow to vital organs throughout the body. There has been a lack of consensus among physicians regarding the relationship of anemia and traumatic brain injuries on a patient's health. Because of this uncertainty, treatment protocols are unclear and inconsistent. Our observational study found that a patient's outcome is worse when he or she is anemic."" See Also: Brain injury researchers find retrieval practice improves memory in youth with TBI Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein crucial to the delivery of oxygenated blood. The researchers studied the outcomes of 939 traumatic brain injury patients with anemia admitted to the Frank L. Mitchell Jr, MD, Trauma Center, a Level I trauma center that is part of MU Health Care. The researchers compared hemoglobin levels of these patients and their outcomes within one year of surgery. Despite also having more severe head and systemic injuries, patients with lower levels of hemoglobin had a poor outcome. For each increase in hemoglobin of 1 gram above 7 grams per deciliter of blood, the likelihood of a good outcome increased by 33 percent. To restore a patient's hemoglobin level, a patient can receive a blood transfusion. However, stored blood may not perform as well as a patient's own blood, and patients may experience allergic reactions or viral infections as a result of the transfusion. Additionally, the cost of one unit of blood ranges from $200 to $300. ""The purpose of this study is not to propose transfusion guidelines, but rather to show that anemia can be harmful to patients with traumatic brain injuries,"" Litofsky said. ""Now that we have shown that anemia affects a patient's recovery, further studies are needed to determine the best way to correct it.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/neuroscientists-illuminate-role-autism-linked-gene-284275,Neuroscientists illuminate role of autism linked gene  Loss of Shank gene prevents neuronal synapses from properly maturing  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Loss of Shank gene prevents neuronal synapses from properly maturing -A new study from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscientists reveals that a gene mutation associated with autism plays a critical role in the formation and maturation of synapses between neurons. Many genetic variants have been linked to autism, but only a handful are potent enough to induce the disorder on their own. Among these variants, mutations in a gene called Shank3 are among the most common, occurring in about 0.5 percent of people with autism. See Also: Low levels of hormone linked to social deficit in autism Scientists know that Shank3 helps cells respond to input from other neurons, but because there are two other Shank proteins, and all three can fill in for each other in certain ways, it has been difficult to determine exactly what the Shank proteins are doing. ""It's clearly regulating something in the neuron that's receiving a synaptic signal, but some people find one role and some people find another,"" says Troy Littleton, a professor in the departments of Biology and of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, a member of MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and the senior author of the study. ""There's a lot of debate over what it really does at synapses."" Key to the study is that fruit flies, which Littleton's lab uses to study synapses, have only one version of the Shank gene. By knocking out that gene, the researchers eliminated all Shank protein from the flies. ""This is the first animal where we have completely removed all Shank family proteins,"" says Kathryn Harris, a Picower Institute research scientist and lead author of the paper, which appears in the Journal of Neuroscience. Scientists already knew that the Shank proteins are scaffold proteins, meaning that they help to organize the hundreds of other proteins found in the synapse of a postsynaptic cell. These proteins help to coordinate the cell's response to the incoming signal. ""Shank is essentially a hub for signaling,"" Harris says. ""It brings in a lot of other partners and plays an organizational role at the postsynaptic membrane."" Don't Miss: Colors of autism spectrum described by CanChild researchersIn fruit flies lacking the Shank protein, the researchers found two dramatic effects. First, the postsynaptic cells had many fewer boutons, which are the sites where neurotransmitter release occurs. Second, many of the boutons that did form were not properly developed; that is, they were not surrounded by all of the postsynaptic proteins normally found there, which are required to respond to synaptic signals. The researchers are now studying how this reduction in functional synapses affects the brain. Littleton suspects that the development of neural circuits could be impaired, which, if the same holds true in humans, may help explain some of the symptoms seen in autistic people. ""During critical windows of social and language learning, we reshape our connections to drive connectivity patterns that respond to rewards and language and social interactions,"" he says. ""If Shank is doing similar things in the mammalian brain, one could imagine potentially having those circuits form relatively normally early on, but if they fail to properly mature and form the proper number of connections, that could lead to a variety of behavioral defects."" Pinpointing an exact link to autism symptoms would be difficult to do in fruit fly studies, however. ""Although the core molecular machines that allow neurons to communicate are highly conserved between fruit flies and humans, the anatomy of the various circuits that are formed during evolution are quite different,"" Littleton says. ""It's hard to jump from a synaptic defect in the fly to an autism-like phenotype because the circuits are so different."" The researchers also showed, for the first time, that loss of Shank affects a well-known set of proteins that comprise the Wnt (also known as Wingless) signaling pathway. When a Wnt protein binds to a receptor on the cell, it initiates a series of interactions that influence which genes are turned on. This, in turn, contributes to many cell processes including embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and tumor formation. Learn More: Genetic basis for distinct type of autism uncovered When Shank is missing from fruit flies, Wnt signaling is disrupted because the receptor that normally binds to Wnt fails to be internalized by the cell. Normally, a small segment of the activated receptor moves to the cell nucleus and influences the transcription of genes that promote maturation of synapses. Without Shank, Wnt signaling is impaired and the synapses do not fully mature. The finding raises the possibility of treating autism with drugs that promote Wnt signaling, if the same connection is found in humans. ""Because the link to Wnt signaling is new and hasn't been picked up in mammalian studies, we really hope that that can inspire people to look for a connection to Wnt signaling in mammalian models, and maybe that can offer another avenue for how loss of Shank could be counteracted,"" Harris says.

Just like Pavlov's dogs, we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink. See Also: Brain damage during stroke may point to source of addiction Indeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience by researchers from Concordia University in Montreal. ""Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,"" says Nadia Chaudhri, the study's lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology. ""Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviors that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ [liquor store] or reaching for a beer."" The results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them. According to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn't just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption. Don't Miss: Cocaine addiction: Scientists discover 'back door' into the brain""Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,"" Chaudhri explains. ""These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behavior, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviors."" For the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux, worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. The researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue. This happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. The researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable. So how can rat behavior help explain human addiction? ""Lots of our behaviors are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,"" says Chaudhri. ""By modelling these behaviors in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviors are acquired and maintained in humans."" She explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviors like responding to cues that predict alcohol. Learn More: Studies: Addiction starts with an overcorrection in the brain ""This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,"" says Chaudhri. ""Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behavior. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction."" Chaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.

Nicolaou has reported the streamlined total synthesis of delta12-prostaglandin J3, a molecule previously claimed to kill leukemic cancer cells. The researchers said their work sets the stage for large-scale synthesis of the cytotoxic agent, a lipid found in nearly all animal tissues, and related compounds that can be produced as potential agents to treat certain types of cancer. The report by Nicolaou and his colleagues on the streamlined total synthesis appeared in Chemistry   A European Journal. The Nicolaou lab specializes in the synthesis of therapeutic molecules found in nature, but in amounts too small for thorough biological evaluation or clinical use. Since joining Rice and setting up at the BioScience Research Collaborative in 2013, Nicolaou and his team have achieved the synthesis of several cancer-fighting molecules. Nicolaou is best known for the total synthesis of paclitaxel, a drug commonly used to treat a number of cancers. The prostaglandin the Nicolaou lab synthesized had been isolated in 2011 as a secondary metabolite formed from eicosapentaenoic acid that is found primarily in fish oil. The Nicolaou lab reported the first total synthesis of the molecule in 2014. That allowed them to confirm its structure. Now the lab has established techniques to develop related disease-fighting compounds and ramp up bulk production if necessary. Several such derivatives under consideration as preclinical drug candidates were detailed in a second paper by the lab this month. The lab reported that total synthesis of the natural product now requires only six steps from commercially available starting materials. Such a concise and efficient route is highly desirable for the synthesis of preclinical drug candidates and drugs. In the second paper, the Nicolaou lab identified a macrolactone derivative, formed by joining two functional groups together, as a promising chemotherapy agent to fight a variety of cancers. That publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society described the synthesis of dozens of prostaglandin derivatives. Nicolaou said the National Institutes of Health s National Cancer Institute (NCI) tested their cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cell samples.  All of the compounds were sent to the NCI for testing,  Nicolaou said.  In their initial tests, they give a high dosage to cancer cells to see if the compound has any activity. Some of them failed that test. But those that pass go for further testing at lower concentrations to see how powerful they are.  One derivative tested by NCI, designated as macrolactone 11, is currently under evaluation as a preclinical drug candidate, Nicolaou said. Related compounds macrolactone 33 and 44, which he said showed evidence of even higher potency against leukemia, lung cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, renal, prostate cancer  and several more we did not include in this paper,  are also being considered for further testing by Texas Medical Center collaborators. Results obtained in collaboration with the group of Mark Br nstrup, a professor at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Germany, led the researchers to suspect the molecule works by inhibiting the export of a translocation biosensor from a cancer cell s nucleus through a covalent addition to an export receptor. The lab continues to develop drug candidates based on prostaglandin.  The macrolactones are very good   better than the natural product   and now we re following this lead to optimize the potency while minimizing toxicity. It s a balancing act,  Nicolaou said.  In the process we ve developed a lot of nice chemistry, and we know a lot more about the biology of this compound,  he said.  We ve advanced organic synthesis in general and also enriched the knowledge about how these kind of molecules behave. We hope the papers provide some ideas and leads and inspiration for others to follow.

In recent years, researchers have gained insights into the roles of different types of fat tissue in weight control. Adults have mostly white fat, in which excess calories are stored as chemicals called fatty acids. Too much white fat increases the risk of several metabolic disorders. Brown fat, in contrast, burns energy to create heat and help maintain body temperature. Infants have brown fat when they're born, but we lose it as we age. Brown fat was only recently proven to exist in adults. Since brown fat cells are able to burn calories, they could potentially play a role in strategies to reduce obesity and its associated disorders. Fat tissue and its supporting blood vessel network can change over time. Compounds such as rosiglitazone (Rosi) and prostaglandin E2 analog (PGE2) have been shown to have  browning  effects on white fat tissue increasing metabolism and the growth of new blood vessels. However, such drugs may have unwanted effects on other tissues. Nanometer-sized particles, or nanoparticles, can be designed to target specific organs or tissues. The technology is current being explored in cancer and other therapies. A team led by Dr. Robert Langer at MIT and Dr. Omid Farokhzad at Brigham and Women s Hospital designed nanoparticles to target browning agents to fat tissue. The study, funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), appeared on May 17, 2016, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers developed nanoparticles with a core containing Rosi or PGE2 along with a polymer called PLGA that enables slow release of the drug. To target the nanoparticles to fat tissue, the outer surface was made of a polymer called PEG attached to either iRGD or P3 compounds that bind to molecules inside the blood vessels of fat tissue. The particles were delivered to the mice by intravenous injection. Compared to control mice given the drugs free in solution or in nontargeted nanoparticles, the mice treated with the targeted nanoparticles had darker white fat. Under the microscope, their fat cells appeared smaller and there were more blood vessels. Expression of UCP1, a marker of brown fat cells, was significantly raised by the targeted nanoparticles as well. The researchers next tested the Rosi nanoparticles in obese mice fed a high-fat diet. The targeted nanoparticles inhibited body weight gain by about 10% compared to untreated mice, or to mice treated with Rosi in solution or in nontargeted nanoparticles. Mice treated with targeted nanoparticles had smaller fat cells, more blood vessels, and higher levels of brown fat markers. Notably, the groups had similar food intakes. These findings show that the targeted Rosi nanoparticles reduced weight gain by browning fat tissue. This study focused on Rosi as a proof of concept. In the clinic, Rosi has serious side effects, but agents other than Rosi or PGE2 could be loaded into the nanoparticles.  The advantage here is now you have a way of targeting it to a particular area and not giving the body systemic effects,  Langer says.  You can get the positive effects that you d want in terms of anti-obesity but not the negative ones that sometimes occur. ","Published: May 25, 2016"

The study showed that Relvar  Ellipta  100/25mcg (fluticasone furoate  FF /vilanterol  VI  or  FF/VI ) achieved a superior reduction in exacerbations versus usual care, in patients with COPD, in an everyday clinical practice setting. Usual care included long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) administered as monotherapy, dual or triple combinations. For the primary effectiveness analysis, in patients treated with FF/VI 100/25mcg there was a statistically significant reduction of 8.41% (CI 1.12,15.17) in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with those receiving usual care (p=0.025). Within the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) was similar between the groups (29% FF/VI, 27% usual care). For pneumonia, an SAE of special interest, FF/VI demonstrated non-inferiority versus usual care (7% FF/VI versus 6% usual care). This endpoint was a regulatory post-authorisation measure requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Patrick Vallance, President, Pharmaceuticals R&D, GSK, commented:  In this genuinely ground-breaking study we have worked closely with the local NHS clinical community to study patients in their everyday setting. To ensure the results from Salford were as robust as possible, we made a long-term financial investment in the study, including supporting local infrastructure and training. Innovation often means you have to ask challenging questions to make significant advances, and I believe this is what we have achieved in these positive results announced today.  Eric Dube, SVP and Head, Global Respiratory Franchise, GSK, said:  The Salford Lung Study COPD results support the effectiveness of Relvar. As we move beyond the headline results, we will learn so much more about the medicine and disease management. We believe the results could transform understanding of how patients in everyday clinical practice respond to COPD treatments. We want to say a big thank you to everyone who has made this unique study possible.  Lead investigator, J rgen Vestbo, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the Centre for Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, University Hospital South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Manchester, said:  The Salford Lung Study is a very important trial to help us understand more about the medicines we prescribe on a day-to-day basis. This is an important finding; what we are seeing today is the tip of the iceberg. Over the coming months we will understand more about the day-to-day effectiveness of FF/VI and how treatment choice, patient behaviour, co-morbidities and other factors combine to influence COPD outcomes. This has been a highly collaborative effort to gather data that will help improve understanding about the effectiveness of respiratory medicines when used in usual clinical practice.  Michael W. Aguiar, President and Chief Executive Officer of Innoviva., said:  We are very pleased that Relvar Ellipta achieved superiority compared to usual care in SLS, a world-first effectiveness study in COPD. These data provide a significant body of evidence in everyday clinical practice and add to the data generated from other randomized controlled studies. These data are unique in the world of evidence generation in COPD. We look forward to disclosing further data and analyses, which we believe will be of significant value to both physicians and patients.  Analyses remain ongoing and will be the subject of future publications and presentations. A second Salford Lung Study is currently being conducted in asthma patients, with results expected in 2017.","Published: May 25, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/harnessing-natures-vast-array-of-venoms-for-drug-discovery-196734,Harnessing Nature s Vast Array of Venoms for Drug Discovery Scripps scientists have developed a method for rapidly identifying venoms  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. There are lessons to be learned from venoms. Scorpions, snakes, snails, frogs and other creatures are thought to produce tens or even hundreds of millions of distinct venoms. These venoms have been honed to strike specific targets in the body. For victims of a scorpion s sting, that spells doom. For scientists, however, the potent molecules in venoms hold the potential to be adapted into medicines. But venoms are difficult to isolate and analyze using traditional methods, so only a handful have been turned into drugs. Now a team led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) has invented a method for rapidly identifying venoms that strike a specific target in the body and optimizing such venoms for therapeutic use. The researchers demonstrated the new method by using it to identify venoms that block a certain protein on T cells a protein implicated in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. The researchers then used their method to find an optimized, long-acting variant of a venom that blocks this protein and showed that the new molecule powerfully reduces inflammation in mice.  Until now we haven t had a way to seriously harness venoms  vast therapeutic potential,  said principal investigator Richard A. Lerner, Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Immunochemistry at TSRI. The report on the advance by Lerner and his colleagues was selected as a  Hot Paper  and cover story by the journal Angewandte Chemie. Choose Your Poison The use of venoms as therapies may seem paradoxical, since these molecules generally evolved to harm and kill other organisms. But a low dose delivered to the right place can sometimes have highly beneficial effects. The pain-killing drug ziconotide (Prialt ), for example, is derived from one of the venoms used by cone-snails to immobilize their fishy prey. Venoms also are attractive from a drug development perspective because they tend to hit their targets on cells with very high potency and selectivity. Drug companies would have adapted far more venoms into therapies by now, but the traditional method of determining the biological target of a venom is slow, difficult and expensive. It involves the extraction of relatively large quantities of venom from the animal species in question, followed by purification of the molecules and laborious lab-dish tests to see how they affect cells. The new method is geared for speed and involves the extraction only of information with little direct involvement of venomous creatures. To start, the TSRI-led team, including first author Hongkai Zhang, a senior scientist in the Lerner laboratory, consulted animal toxin databases and assembled a list of 589 venoms whose protein sequences have features of interest. They then synthesized the venoms  genes and inserted them into special viruses that deliver genes into cells. The aim in this initial, proof-of-principle project was to find venoms that block a potassium ion-channel protein known as Kv1.3. Ion channels allow charged molecules to flow in and out of cells, and are involved in a variety of essential biological functions which makes them common targets of venoms. Kv1.3 is of special interest to the pharmaceutical industry because it appears to facilitate the proliferation and migration of T-cells that drive inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Drugs that block Kv1.3 are already under development. To screen their library of venoms for those that block Kv1.3, the researchers, including a team of collaborating biologists at the Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies at ShanghaiTech University, used a cell-based selection system of a type developed by Lerner, Zhang and colleagues in 2012. They created a culture of special Kv1.3-containing test cells in which a strong interaction between a venom and a Kv1.3 ion channel would switch on a red fluorescence gene. The researchers distributed the venom-gene-carrying viruses among the cells and used a fast, automated system to select the cells that showed strong fluorescence. Standard molecular biology techniques were then used to identify and quantify the venom genes these cells contained. The researchers repeated this selection process for three rounds to see which venom genes became most abundant in the cells. In this way, the team soon identified 27 likely Kv1.3-blocking venoms. All but two turned out to be known blockers of the ion channel. Another had been reported in the literature as a suspected potassium-channel blocker, and the last, an uncharacterized scorpion venom called CllTx1, proved in subsequent traditional-method testing using actual venom extracted from a scorpion to be a potent Kv1.3 blocker. Optimal Pharmaceutical Properties The team realized that their selection system could be useful not only for screening libraries of natural venoms but also for screening artificial variants or  analogs  of a given venom to find those with optimal pharmaceutical properties. To demonstrate, they generated about a million analogs of a long-acting protein based on ShK, a sea anemone toxin that blocks Kv1.3, and put the analogs through three rounds of selection to find the best one. The resulting candidate, S1-2, showed a strong effect not only for blocking Kv1.3 but also for reducing inflammation in a standard rodent model.  This analog appears to be very potent against Kv1.3 and has no off-target effects on closely related ion channels,  said Zhang. Zhang, Lerner and their colleagues now plan to use their method with much larger venom datasets to find more drug candidates.  We re particularly interested in finding venoms that block sodium ion channels involved in pain,  Lerner said. In addition to Lerner and Zhang, co-authors of the paper,  Autocrine-Based Selection of Drugs that Target Ion Channels from Combinatorial Venom Peptide Libraries,  were Mingjuan Du, Xiao Liu, Jingying Sun, Wei Wang and Xiu Xin of ShanghaiTech University; Lourival D. Possani of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who purified the scorpion toxin CllTx1 for analysis; and Jia Xie and Kyungmoo Yea of TSRI.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/early-genetic-changes-in-premalignant-colorectal-tissue-identified-193084,Early Genetic Changes in Premalignant Colorectal Tissue Identified Findings point to drivers of early cancer development  targets for cancer prevention therapies  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have discovered mutations that may fuel early cancer growth in precancerous colorectal tissue from high-risk patients. Their study, published in Cancer Prevention Research, is the first to use advanced genetic sequencing techniques to characterize genetic changes in precancerous polyps and nearby tissue that has not yet transformed into polyps. In addition to mutations at very early stages of cancer development, the findings identify potential drug targets for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Although most of the genetic changes present in advanced CRC are known, those occurring before cancer develops have remained elusive, explained co-senior author Eduardo Vilar-Sanchez, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor, Clinical Cancer Prevention. To identify the earliest mutations, researchers studied polyps and nearby colorectal tissue, or mucosa, from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by an inherited mutation in the APC gene. APC mutations are responsible for 80 percent of CRC cases, making FAP an attractive model to study CRC development, explained Vilar-Sanchez. Although responsible for only 1 percent of all diagnoses, patients with FAP have a 100 percent lifetime risk of developing CRC without preventive actions.  We have a great need to identify prevention strategies in these populations. The idea is to develop a mini pre-malignant genome atlas to better understand the genomic events in small polyps very early on. Our study sets the groundwork to identify novel biomarkers or targets for chemoprevention,  said Vilar-Sanchez. Researchers characterized genetic changes in polyps and adjacent mucosa samples, which, despite appearing normal, is considering  at-risk  tissue. Whole exome sequencing was performed on 25 colorectal polyps, 10 adjacent mucosa, and 12 blood samples from 12 patients with FAP from MD Anderson and the Catalan Institute of Oncology. A particular challenge associated with samples of this type is that the precancerous cells with mutations of interest are mixed with a majority of normal tissue.  In addition to looking for genetic mutations in a small fraction of the DNA, there is a very limited amount of total DNA to study, since the polyps are small,  said co-senior author Paul Scheet, Ph.D., associate professor, Epidemiology, and team lead for the algorithm used for the complex sequencing analysis.  As these lesions are at a very early stage of potential transition to malignancy, assessing mutations demands a highly sensitive method that makes use of all available knowledge.  Researchers identified 2,314 genetic changes in polyps, with an average of 83 mutations per polyp and an average rate of 1.75 mutations per megabase, or 1 million DNA bases. In adjacent mucosa, the researchers discovered 279 alterations, with an average of 27 mutations per sample and an average rate of 0.49 mutations per megabase. Many of these mutations appeared to be in groups of genes that work together in cell signaling networks. Members of one network, called the Wnt signaling pathway, which includes the APC gene, appear to be especially important for the transformation of mucosa to polyps.  Wnt is the dominant driver for these types of polyps at a very early stage. It is completely central to the development of pre-malignancy in colorectal cancer, and targeting Wnt should be a priority for chemoprevention,  said Vilar-Sanchez. When comparing mutations identified in these samples, the research team found at least 23 percent of mutations in the polyps already were present in at-risk mucosa. A further comparison between polyps and Stage I cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed greater similarity between premalignant and cancerous tissue than expected.  Mutation rates of adenomas were surprisingly very close to the mutation rates you will find with Stage I colorectal cancers. You obviously see the rates go up, but between polyps and cancers, there is a good degree of overlap,  said Vilar-Sanchez. Those polyps with more genetic changes, similar to early stage cancers, may be more likely to develop into CRC, explained Vilar-Sanchez. Unfortunately, there is no way to be sure which polyps will transform after they have been removed from the patient. The study was limited by a small number of samples and the small amount of available sample. In future work, the team plans to analyze similar samples from individuals with an average risk of CRC. Additionally, they plan to analyze precancerous tissue for gene expression changes to complement genetic alterations, in order to better characterize the molecular subtypes of early polyps. Doing so may allow physicians to predict which polyps present a higher risk, and to develop treatments to prevent them from progressing to cancer.","Published: May 25, 2016"

A research group with expertise in protein folding at the University of Massachusetts Amherst led by biochemist Daniel Hebert reports for the first time how a key protein in the blood coagulation pathway folds to a higher-energy or  cocked  state, so it can function as a sort of  molecular mousetrap  and generate the work required to perform physiologically important functions. Hebert says,  Generally these proteins don t have a lot of mobility, but this particular protein is folded like a spring-loaded trap, so it is stable at a higher energy state. When it s needed, it fires from a loaded position and undergoes the big structural changes needed to carry out its inhibitory function against target proteases. We can explain now for the first time how it folds in live cells into an active state and how it avoids folding to a more stable but inactive state.  He and biophysicist Lila Gierasch, with Anne Gershenson, a specialist in the serpin family of proteins and serinopathies they studied, used radio-labeled pulse-chase techniques to follow the serpin antithrombin III (ATIII) through time as it folded. They also used antibodies to isolate it and gel electrophoresis to analyze its expression, folding and function. Hebert says it takes about one hour overall for cells to synthesize, fold and secrete the serpin ATIII, but he and colleagues found that in the critical first few minutes of this process a key positioning of the mousetrap s trigger wire takes place, and the rest of the trap builds around it, allowing it to reach the loaded higher energy conformation.  We found it a bit surprising that the part of the protein that is synthesized last is locked into place early in the folding process, helping to guide later structure formation. But on reflection it makes sense, because the amount of energy it would take to cock the trigger at the end would be prohibitive. So the protein starts out cocked, and goes on from there.  The research team introduced a number of disease-associated mutations and watched where proteins containing these mutations diverged from normal folding. Their paper not only introduces and defines for the first time the early stages of the normal pathway but it describes how 13 mutations found in humans affect ATIII folding. They are already working with medical geneticists on identifying pharmacological chaperones to help mutated, misfolded proteins fold correctly and develop better constructs for gene therapies, Hebert says.  We figured out the key for this protein to fold correctly,  he adds.  We utilized a type of serpin with a particular kind of covalent bond that would give us an experimental advantage that we could exploit to map the folding reaction. We chose this target deliberately and it allowed us to sort out the earliest stages that provided the key to how the spring gets loaded.  The serpin family is an important class of proteins that control diverse biological processes, and unlike other proteins they don t always fold to their most stable state, Hebert notes. In fact, as noted, ATIII folds to a higher energy state, which is harder to get to and offers more chances for problems to arise during protein structure formation. Misfolded and partly folded serpins will never make it out of the cell, leading to lower protein levels in blood or to the build up of a toxic conformation, either of which is associated with disease.

It was developed by researchers from the University of Bath s Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, working with colleagues at Bristol Heart Institute. So far the shortage of adequate patient-derived scaffolds that can support blood vessel growth has been a major limitation for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Other methods only allow limited formation of small blood vessels such as capillaries, which makes tissue less likely to successfully transplant into a patient. In addition other methods of tissue growth require the use of animal products, unnecessary in this technique which uses human platelet lysate gel (hPLG) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)   a type of cell which helps maintain blood vessel walls. Dr Giordano Pula, Lecturer in Pharmacology at the University of Bath and head of the research team making the discovery, said:  A major challenge in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is providing the new tissue with a network of blood vessels, and linking this to the patient s existing blood supply; this is vital for the tissue s survival and integration with adjacent tissues. Dr Paul De Bank, Senior Lecturer in Pharmaceutics at the University of Bath and co-author of the paper, said:  By embedding EPCs in a gel derived from platelets, both of which can be isolated from the patient s blood, we have demonstrated the formation of a network of small vessels. What is more, the gel contains a number of different growth factors which can induce existing blood vessels to infiltrate the gel and form connections with the new structures. Combining tissue-specific cells with this EPC-containing gel offers the potential for the formation of fully vascularised, functional tissues or organs, which integrate seamlessly with the patient.  This discovery has the potential to accelerate the development of regenerative medicine applications.  Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation, said:  Over a half a million people in the UK are living with heart failure, a disabling condition which can leave people unable to carry out everyday activities such as climbing the stairs or even walking to the shops. This regenerative research brings the British Heart Foundation s goal to mend a broken heart and beat heart failure one step closer.  All living tissues, including new heart muscle, need a blood supply. One of the fundamental goals of regenerative medicine is to find ways to grow a new blood supply from scratch. Previous attempts at this using human cells and synthetic scaffolds have met with only limited success.  The beauty of this new approach is that components of a person s own blood could be manipulated to create a scaffold on which new blood vessels could grow. This increases the likelihood that the new tissue will be integrated into the patient s body which, if proven successful with more research, could improve the lives of people affected by heart failure.

Now, an international team of scientists led by Rutgers faculty has conducted the world s most comprehensive analysis of coral genes, focusing on how their evolution has allowed corals to interact with and adapt to the environment. A second study led by Rutgers researchers with colleagues at the University of Hawaii shows   for the first time   how stony corals create their hard skeletons, using proteins as key ingredients.  There are a few key genes in corals that allow them to build this house that laid down the foundation for many, many thousands of years of corals,  said Debashish Bhattacharya, a professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers.  It couldn t be any more fundamental to ocean ecosystems.   I think one of the more interesting aspects of these data will be to understand which coral species may become winners or losers in the face of anthropogenic climate change   what makes them tougher and what makes them susceptible to changes in temperature, changes in ocean acidification,  said Paul Falkowski, a professor who leads the Environmental Biophysics and Molecular Ecology Laboratory at Rutgers. The coral gene database study, led by Bhattacharya and Falkowski, was published today in the journal eLife. The study stems from an international coral genomics symposium and workshop held at Rutgers in February 2014 that was funded by the National Science Foundation. The stony coral study was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences last month. Nearly all corals are colonial organisms that consist of as many as hundreds of thousands of animals called polyps. Types of corals include stony, shallow-water species that build reefs, soft corals and deep-water corals that live in dark cold waters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Corals face four major threats from humans:  Destruction of reefs by grenades and poison used to kill fish for food; nutrient pollution, usually from sewage or agricultural runoff, that overstimulates harmful algae; increased heat in the upper ocean, which causes most coral bleaching that can kill reefs; and acidification of the ocean, according to Falkowski.  Corals are the most diverse marine ecosystems on the planet,  he said.  But their value to marine ecosystems   and to our own use of marine resources   is very underappreciated.  Recent aerial and underwater surveys have found that 93 percent of the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland in Australia has endured very severe, moderate or at least some coral bleaching this year, according to the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia. The reef, a world-renowned tourist attraction, is about 1,430 miles long. Elevated sea temperatures from global warming can cause corals to expel tiny, colorful algae, according to the center. Corals turn translucent and white when they lose the algae. Mildly bleached corals can recover if the temperature drops and algae can recolonize them. If not, corals may die. At Rutgers two years ago, leaders in the field of coral biology and genomics met to plan an analysis of 20 coral genomic datasets. The goal was to provide a comprehensive understanding of coral evolution since the organisms appeared on Earth 525 million years ago. The coral database, which includes corals in tropical waters, has been posted on the comparative.reefgenomics.org website to foster growth in this important area of research. The eLife study s major advances include explaining the origin and evolution of the unique genes involved in the creation of hard skeletons by corals. The study also serves as a novel toolkit compared with the genes of humans, shellfish and other animals with hard skeletons. Bhattacharya and coauthors found dozens of genes that allow corals to coordinate their response to changes in temperature, light and pH (acidity vs. alkalinity) and deal with stress triggered by the algae that live with them and exposure to high levels of light. Surprisingly, some of these stress-related genes are of bacterial origin and were acquired to help corals survive. An intriguing theory that arose from the study is that the vast genetic repertoire of corals may help them adapt to changing ocean conditions. The study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences   led by former Rutgers Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences post-doctoral fellow Tali Mass   explains how stony corals make their hard, calcium carbonate skeletons. It also explains how this process might be affected as the oceans become more acidic due to climate change. Acidity increases as oceans are exposed to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas and cause of climate change, in the atmosphere.  The aragonite (hard skeleton) is not just minerals,  Bhattacharya said.  The proteins are very important for giving it shape and making it stable.  Falkowski said the study serves as a model for understanding how we can regenerate bone.  There are amazing parallels between the production of the skeleton of coral and production of bone,  he said.","Published: May 25, 2016"

The development of omics technologies, such as metabolomics and proteomics, and systems biology have dramatically enhanced our ability to understand biological phenomena. Nevertheless the interpretation of large omics data into meaningful  knowledge  as well as the understanding of complex metabolic interactions in engineered microbes remains challenging. This new open-source workflow which integrates various omics data and genome-scale models drives the transition from vision to conception of a designed working phenotype. The findings were reported in a paper entitled  Characterizing strain variation in engineered E. coli using a multi-omics based workflow  published in Cell Systems. Taek Soon Lee, JBEI s Director of Metabolic Engineering and Deputy Vice President of the Fuels Synthesis Division is the study s co-corresponding author along with Bernhard Palsson at University of California, San Diego. Elizabeth Brunk (formerly at JBEI, and currently at UC San Diego) is the study s co-first author along with Kevin George at JBEI (currently at Amyris). Lee s team analyzed a large omics data set from eight engineered strains producing three different biofuels, applied the workflow to identify the roles of candidate genes, pathways, and biochemical reactions in observed experimental phenomena, and finally used this approach to facilitate the construction of a mutant strain with improved productivity.  Synthetic biology and systems biology have been considered as two distinct technical frameworks. We hope the confluence of these two fields will benefit biofuels research and its scientific community,  says Lee.  Our team is sharing this workflow as an open-source tool in the form of iPython notebooks, which allows anyone in the microbial engineering field to easily apply this workflow to their system .","Published: May 25, 2016"

A research team led by Linda Spear, distinguished professor of psychology at Binghamton University, gave alcohol to rats every other day, starting from early to mid-adolescence. When the team looked at the same rats in adulthood, they found that adult males didn't show hormonal stress adaptation, making them more vulnerable to chronic stress. See Also: Prenatal alcohol exposure alters development of brain function ""Stress hormones are released when you get anxious or are in a stressful circumstance,"" said Spear. ""The classic stress hormone is cortisol in humans; it's corticosterone in rats. When you expose the animals to a stressor, the first time they show a large hormone stress response. However, this hormonal response normally adapts over time, such that less hormone is released following repeated exposure to a relatively mild stressor. And that's important, because cortisol or corticosterone helps you respond to an emergency. But it's bad to have elevated levels in the long term, because sustained elevations in these levels of these hormones have adverse effects on a lot of body systems. So cortisol is needed for emergencies, but you don't want it elevated all the time. And what we found is that following adolescent alcohol exposure, adults don't show that hormonal stress adaptation. They don't adapt to the chronic stressor, which suggests that they may be more vulnerable later to chronic stress.""

See Also: Neuroimaging technique identifies concussion-related brain disease in living brain The paper explaining the use of PET and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) to diagnose AD appears in the current special issue of Technology and Innovation- Journal of the National Academy of Inventors, which is devoted to the evolution of neuroimaging. ""Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is pathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques containing amyloid-beta (A ) and neurofibrillary tangles [in the brain],"" said Ann D. Cohen, professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. ""[PiB] is thioflavin-T (ThT) derivative, a small molecule known to bind to amyloid proteins.... Imaging AD pathology, using amyloid PET imaging agents such as PiB, has several potential clinical benefits, including preclinical detection of disease and accurately distinguishing AD from non-AD dementia in patients with mild or atypical symptoms."" The PET system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a tracer that is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. A variety of tracers are already used with PET scanning. A tracer used along with PET to explore the possibility of cancer spreading to secondary sites is one of the most common types of PET scan in use in standard medical care, although many other radioactive tracers are used in PET to image the in-tissue concentration of other types of molecules. According to Cohen, using biomarkers such as PiB to better understand cognitive deficits seen in normal aging, as opposed to those in AD, has become critical since the advent of AD prevention trials. Her review focuses on the use of PiB-PET across the spectrum of AD from the earliest PiB studies where PiB retention in the brain was higher in patients when amyloid plaques were present. Prior to these findings, only post-mortem studies could confirm amyloid plaques. ""PiB retention in AD patients was generally most prominent in cortical areas and lower in white matter areas of the brain, consistent with post-mortem studies of A  plaques in the AD brain,"" explained Cohen. Don't Miss: Study findings challenge a scientific principle about amyloid beta According to Cohen, amyloid imaging, alone or along with other biomarkers, will ""likely be critical to the identification of subjects at risk for AD and future decline."" She added that what has become clear from amyloid imaging studies is how early in AD ""the full burden of amyloid plaques begins to develop."" Major challenges ahead, she noted, include finding ways to determine the earliest signs of amyloid accumulation, associating amyloid accumulation with cognitive impairments, and determining whether early amyloid deposition will lead to clinical dementia. These challenges will likely require us ""to continue to focus on cognitively normal elderly and the detection of the earliest signs of amyloid deposition, along with markers of neurodegeneration...to determine the clinical significance of pre-symptomatic pathology,"" concluded Cohen.

If we become sick after eating, we blame the food; however, if we then fall ill without having eaten that food, the causal link becomes ambiguous. New findings from the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan and New York University reveal where and how such ambiguous associations are processed in the brains of rats. See Also: Researchers stimulate human amygdala for first time; breathing loss recorded Learning how to predict dangerous relationships in the environment such as between odors and food, lightning and thunder, or sounds and predators is essential for survival. While we know much about how experiences become linked with unpleasant outcomes when the associations are clear, how these links are updated in the brain when the relationships are ambiguous was unknown. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, scientists report that ambiguity in these types of associations can be observed in rats that had previously learned a tone-shock association and were then given shocks without the tone. In the brain, they found traces of both the memory and its associated uncertainty stored in neural circuits of a central brain area called the amygdala. When given shocks after hearing a tone, rats who have learned the association normally freeze, anticipating the shock. However, when the same animals learned that shocks could also arrive without a tone, they showed less anticipatory freezing because the causal link between tone and shock was not clear. In the brain, this uncertainty was reflected in reduced strength of neural connections between the auditory system (where tones are processed) and the amygdala, a brain region critical for storing unpleasant memories.  Strong connections that formed after learning the tone-shock association were reversible if the relationship later became ambiguous. By manipulating brain activity during learning with optogenetics, the researchers showed that specific neurons in the amygdala were responsible for enabling the uncertainty. When those neurons were silenced as animals experienced shocks without a preceding tone, surprisingly, rather than acting unsure and freezing less often, the animals always acted as if they expected to be shocked when they heard the tone. This indicated that the amygdala not only stores unpleasant memories, but also plays an active role in an animal s evaluation of the associated level of ambiguity. The authors also mathematically analyzed how rats responded when different patterns of lights, tones, and shocks unfolded in their environment under ambiguous conditions. A longstanding theory suggested that different sensory cues in the environment compete for association with outcomes such as food or threats resulting in one association winning out. Contradicting this theory, the authors found that the way rats evaluate ambiguity can be best described with a dynamic model that considers several different configurations of how tones, lights or other features of the environment might interact during learning. Learn More: Maturing brain flips function of amygdala in regulating stress hormones Tamas Madarasz, the lead author of the study now based at the University of Geneva, explained:  To make successful predictions the brain needs to consider different models of what these configurations could be, and perform computations in parallel using each of the possible models of the environment and the associated uncertainty. This leads to a distributed neural representation for each association. This approach has helped inspire better learning algorithms for computers, and it looks like animals are using this strategy too.  The authors suggest that humans may also evaluate their environment and its events using a statistical approach that computes the probabilities of associations to estimate ambiguity.  We believe we ve discovered a new framework for the amygdala and how its neurons process ambiguous associations,  said senior author Joshua Johansen of BSI.  Our results are important for understanding how memories and associations are formed and modified.  The findings may also have implications for understanding diseases involving ambiguous associations such as anxiety, and in the design of more flexible computer architectures.

The advanced training will equip Vietnamese scientists with the skills in bioinformatics and genomics for crop analysis, and ensures future knowledge for their peers.  Previously, TGAC, UK and AGI, Vietnam, initiated a collaboration to sequence the genome of a representative number of Vietnamese rice varieties to characterise the genetic variations in native rice crops and develop genetic markers that could be used to accelerate rice breeding. The TGAC team will now visit Vietnam several times during the next 12 months funded by the Newton Fund through the British Council to carry out training workshops in advanced bioinformatics tools to help achieve precision breeding techniques for much larger rice yields, while learning about the techniques and diversity involved for rice breeding in Vietnam. Alongside the Vietnamese team of scientists, TGAC, with the collaboration of AGI and NIAB, Cambridge, will develop an advanced genomics platform for rice breeding focused on traits of agronomic interest. The rapid identification of rice varieties that are tolerant and resilient to adverse conditions will work towards alleviating the current challenges the Vietnamese agriculture industry face and contribute to food security. Rice is a staple food for a population of 90 million in Vietnam and one of the main exporter commodities of the country. Vietnam is experiencing an exceptional growth, in its economic output and population rising, as a global leading agricultural country. There is, however, an increasing threat from climate change such as emerging pathogens, drought and rising sea levels. The areas under greatest risk are the deltas of the Red and Mekong rivers, which represent the major rice growing regions of Vietnam. Dr De Vega, Acting Head of the Crop Genomics Group at TGAC, said:  We will complement the generation of this data with the development of databases and the application of bioinformatics pipelines to identify associations of alleles with specific phenotypes.  We expect to characterise markers that will enable more efficient rice breeding. The use of genomic approaches to rice breeding in Vietnam builds on the experience and knowledge that we have developed while working in wheat and barley genomics.  Rice has a simple genome for which many genomics resources have been already generated and it offers an excellent model for the evaluation and assessment of new strategies for breeding that could later be applied to more complex crops.  This collaboration with Vietnam will also open opportunities to work with world leading scientists with experience in rice breeding and agronomy.  The programme will extend to the exchange of scientists from Vietnam coming over to the UK to gain further expertise in bioinformatics and genomics analysis through training workshops; and TGAC scientists also learning from their field phenotyping activities in Vietnam.  TGAC has set up a public database to host the variant data of the latest rice genome assemblies and annotation, accessible to all.  The application of new genomics technologies to improve crop breeding is a priority at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) at UK. The proposed project continues the partnership initiated between TGAC and AGI in partnership with NIAB.

Collaborating with CTM CRC shows that it s an international effort that s needed to ensure we address the barriers in the industry.  Developed across three of CTM s participant organisations, The Women s and Children s Hospital, The University of South Australia and Queensland University of Technology, the technology is competitive with the current gold standard in T-cell stimulation and expansion at the laboratory scale. The consortium will use CGT s experience in, and access to scale up processes for cell expansion.

Developed at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the technology addresses the profound challenge of drug resistance among HIV-infected patients in resource-poor areas. While potent antiretroviral (ARV) drugs exist to treat HIV infection, the virus is a constantly moving target, accumulating mutations and developing into strains that are resistant to a certain ARV, especially when a patient s access to medication is interrupted or he or she does not adhere to a treatment regimen. It is a costly and dangerous problem. The undetected presence of drug-resistant HIV strains in a population means that clinicians may be prescribing a medication that is in limited supply to patients on whom it is ineffective, and those patients may be unknowingly transmitting the resistant virus to others   for example, from mother to child during birth   compounding the problem.  If you can identify resistance early and switch patients to the right drugs, you can reduce new infections,  said David Raiser, Ph.D.  15, CEO of Aldatu. The Cambridge-based startup is currently developing an HIV drug resistance genotyping test for patients failing first-line ARV therapy in low- and middle-income countries, where an inexpensive test could make a great difference across the health care system. Accordingly, the license from Harvard s Office of Technology Development (OTD) is structured to maximize the global impact of the test; it grants Aldatu the right to implement the technology royalty-free in the developing world. Aldatu s co-founders believe a test could be implemented within three years and could save millions of dollars in health care costs. The licensed genotyping platform, called Pan Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA), was invented by two Harvard research associates: Iain MacLeod and Christopher Rowley, M.P.H.  04, now assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and attending physician in the Department of Infectious Diseases at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. MacLeod and Rowley were working in the lab of Myron (Max) Essex, the Mary Woodard Lasker Professor of Health Sciences at the Harvard Chan School and chair of the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP). The Essex lab specializes in studying HIV-1 viruses, the most common type of the disease, their interactions with the immune system, and molecular epidemiology   how the viruses change over time, affecting transmission, disease, and treatment. Through the BHP, a collaboration between the Harvard Chan School AIDS Initiative and the government of Botswana, Harvard researchers have been working for 20 years to stem the AIDS epidemic in southern Africa.  Harvard has done phenomenal work in countries like Botswana and Uganda. A lot of the research, implementations, and policy decisions [around HIV] are actually driven by academia,  said MacLeod.  But a university doesn t have the resources to reach every single infected individual.  The OTD helped the members of the research team protect their intellectual property and advised them on the formation of a startup that could carry out a broader mission. Aldatu is incorporated as a public benefit corporation.  In order to get the technology from its current state to a validated clinical diagnostic product,  said Raiser,  a company really needs to exist that has the explicit purpose of commercializing the technology and leveraging the market to get it to patients. OTD understood that, shared our values, and helped us get Aldatu up and running.  The PANDAA project began in 2012 when Essex, MacLeod, and Rowley were contributing to a BHP study to assess rates of transmitted HIV drug resistance in recently infected pregnant women in Gaborone, Botswana. With Rowley s funding from the National Institutes of Health, the researchers were using existing commercial tests,  doing the genotyping themselves and experiencing firsthand the shortcomings of that technology,  said Raiser. During the study, they saw the rate of transmitted resistance creep up from about 1 percent in 2012 to close to 10 percent within a couple of years. Simply studying, let alone solving, a problem of that magnitude was challenging. Using the older, real-time PCR tests, said MacLeod,  It takes 2  days to look at eight samples, which is just not feasible for large populations.  The process was relatively expensive, too.  The women participating [in the study] were exceptions to the rule; most women don t have access to that type of testing,  Raiser explained.  This is something everyone should have access to, but the vast majority of people don t because there aren t better, faster, cheaper options that can be widely implemented.  Essex, MacLeod, and Rowley set to work on inventing a better diagnostic platform.  We went through and really stressed this old system to see where we could build in some flexibility,  said MacLeod.  We just broke everything to see what works.  To identify drug-resistant viruses, researchers look for key variations in the viral genome. The challenge is that HIV, like many pathogens, is highly polymorphic, meaning the genetic code is rife with slight variations called SNPs ( snips ). Some of these SNPs confer susceptibility or resistance to particular ARVs, while others play different roles in the genome. A highly sensitive technology like standard qPCR can turn up false negatives. PANDAA s advantage, according to the inventors, is that it strips away distracting sequence variation while leaving the clinically relevant SNPs intact. MacLeod and Raiser co-founded Aldatu in 2014, when Raiser was a doctoral student at Harvard Medical School and had recently completed a technology assessment fellowship in the OTD. The startup then joined the Harvard Innovation Labs  Venture Incubation Program, and in 2014 it won the Bertarelli Foundation Grand Prize in the Harvard Deans  Health and Life Sciences Challenge.  That completely changed the way we were talking about Aldatu and HIV drug resistance,  said MacLeod.  It was a phenomenal learning experience.  MacLeod and Raiser are now chief science officer and chief executive officer of Aldatu, respectively, and the company is based at LabCentral near Kendall Square. The license provides Aldatu exclusive rights to Harvard patents filed on PANDAA, covering application of the PANDAA technology in the fields of clinical diagnostics and in-vitro research. It also includes important global access provisions.  The research team has been thoughtful about the economics of access to medical technology since it first came to us with this innovation,  said Grant Zimmermann, director of business development at the OTD.  We worked with Aldatu to license this technology under terms that would speed its path to the clinic in low-income countries, including providing a royalty-free license in the developing world that will help keep the cost as low as possible for the people who urgently need it.   We don t want a big company replacing the current $300 test with another $300 test,  explained MacLeod.  A balance can be struck between being a for-profit company but one that also has a very public health-driven mission behind it. David and I are very strong-minded, if you will, about the public-benefit mission of Aldatu.  In addition to the support from the Harvard Deans  Health and Life Sciences Challenge, Aldatu has received seed funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and from private foundations.","Published: May 24, 2016"

A multi-institutional team developing the technology   and led by the Cincinnati Children s Heart Institute   reports it would let doctors intervene earlier to help patients manage their conditions and help inform future pharmacologic treatment options. In laboratory tests, the model accurately predicts whether mouse models and stem-cell derived heart cells from human patients will develop a hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy.   This technology would make it possible to predict the eventual cardiac phenotype in pediatric patients and help guide their treatment and future monitoring,  said Jeffery Molkentin, PhD, lead author and a researcher in the Division of Molecular Cardiovascular Biology at Cincinnati Children s and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  It could help when counseling patients about athletic endeavors, in which sudden death can occur with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Or it could help decide whether certain patients should consider an implantable cardioverter defibrillator to prevent sudden death as they grow into young adulthood.  Inherited cardiomyopathy is a genetically diverse group of heart muscle diseases affecting about one of every 500 people. There are two primary clinical manifestations: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The diseases involve nearly 1,500 different gene mutations in sarcomeres, the part of the heart muscle that generates tension and contraction.  In HCM, the heart s chambers and valves grow so that they are not symmetric. The dimension of the ventricular chamber is reduced, the interventricular septum thickens, and patients suffer from diastolic dysfunction (in which heart muscle doesn t relax normally), causing an increased risk of sudden death from arrhythmia. With DCM, people have an enlarged left ventricular chamber accompanied by a lengthening of heart cells (myocytes) that results in reduced systolic function and eventually heart failure. Effective drug regimens to manage the conditions do not exist, although there is research looking for new drugs. The only effective treatment at present is a heart transplant. This leaves an urgent need to develop new technologies to manage, treat, cure or prevent the diseases, according to researchers.  In developing the technology, scientists analyzed how sarcomeres generate tension coupled with alterations in calcium cycling, which is critical to heart function. The coupling of tension generation and calcium cycling is altered in patients with sarcomeric gene mutations. The alteration can be measured and then used to predict how the heart will change as disease progresses, Molkentin said. To study the influence of gene mutations on this process, researchers tested an array of genetically altered mice. The mouse models were either normal (wild type) mice or those expressing different gene mutations for various cardiomyopathies.  This allowed researchers to examine tension generation and associated calcium cycling rates through heart muscle in a highly defined manner. That information was used to create a mathematical model for disease prediction that integrates the total tension generated by isolated cardiomyocytes. The tension-integrated, algorithm-based model was able to predict if hearts in mouse models would undergo hypertrophic or dilated cardiac growth.  The scientists next tested the computational model on human cells from cardiomyopathy patients by using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. Reprogrammed and derived from actual patient skin fibroblast cells, iPSCs can become virtually any cell type in the human body and then used for scientific investigation of disease properties. Molkentin and his colleagues generated patient-specific cardiomyocytes   which under a microscope can actually be seen pulsating rhythmically similar to a beating heart. Patient-derived iPSCs also carry the same genetic makeup (including mutations) as the person donating original starter cells. In the study, iPSC heart cells developed the same cardiomyopathy tension deficits as the patient s own hearts.   Researchers then used their heart defect prediction method to see how accurately it determined the heart defect type of specific cardiomyopathy patients. With collaborators at the Stanford University School of Medicine, Molkentin and his colleagues generated four lines of developing, early-stage patient-specific iPSC heart cells (cardiomyocytes). They report that their technology accurately determined the HCM vs. DCM heart defect of the donor patients.   Researchers continue to develop and test the technology by using it to determine the cardiac disease state of patients with specific mutations in a sarcomere encoding gene. They caution the technology is years away from potential clinical use, pending further testing and refinement. The research team includes collaborators from Temple University (Philadelphia), the University of Washington (Seattle), Stanford University School of Medicine (Stanford, Calif.), Harvard Medical School-Brigham and Women s Hospital (Boston) and the University of Minnesota Medical School (Minneapolis).

The enzyme, known as HIV-1 protease, is a key drug target for HIV and AIDS therapies.   Researchers from ORNL, Georgia State University and the Institut Laue-Langevin in France used neutron crystallography to uncover details of interactions of hydrogen bonds at the enzyme s active site, revealing a pH-induced proton  hopping  mechanism that guides its activity. The team discussed the findings in a paper published in the journal Angewandte Chemie. Understanding the enzyme s structure and function at the atomic level, including the location and movement of hydrogen atoms, is vital for understanding drug resistance and guiding rational drug design.  HIV-1 protease is responsible for the maturation of virus particles into infectious HIV virions, which ultimately leads to the development of AIDS. Without effective HIV-1 protease activity, HIV virions remain non-infectious, so the disruption of HIV-1 protease activity is a key target for successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs that attack the virus itself. The use of X-ray crystallography to study the structures of HIV-1 protease and drug complexes has led to the design of effective, commercially available ART drugs, but x-rays cannot determine the positions of mobile hydrogen atoms and protons. Neutron crystallography, however, can reveal these hydrogen-bonding interactions, which play a key role in how effectively a drug binds to its target. The ORNL-ILL-Georgia State research team used neutron crystallography to probe the structure of HIV-1 protease in complex with the clinical inhibitor Darunavir. The researchers combined neutron diffraction data from the IMAGINE instrument at ORNL s High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, and the LAD-III instrument at ILL, to uncover details of the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the active site and reveal ways to enhance drug binding and reduce drug resistance. The group also examined how the enzyme s catalytic activity responds to changes in pH (acidity) levels.  By determining structures at different pHs, the group directly observed the positions of hydrogen atoms before and after a pH-induced two-proton transfer between the drug and enzyme. The proton transfer, triggered by electrostatic effects arising from proton uptake by surface residues from solution, resulted in the proton configuration that is critical for the catalytic activity.   These results highlight that neutrons represent a superb probe to obtain structural details for proton transfer reactions in biological systems,  said ILL instrument scientist Matthew Blakely.   Darunavir s structure allows it to create more hydrogen bonds with the protease active site than most drugs of its type, while the backbone of HIV-1 protease maintains its spatial conformation in the presence of mutations,  said ORNL instrument scientist Andrey Kovalevsky.  This means Darunavir-protease interaction is less likely to be disrupted by a mutation. Given these characteristics, Darunavir is an excellent therapy target to refine and therefore enhance HIV treatment.  Direct observation of proton transfer in chemical and biological systems is challenging; macromolecular neutron crystallography has been pivotal in providing key details regarding hydrogen bonding that were required in order to answer long-standing questions about the enzyme mechanism of this important HIV drug target.   Moreover, we observed changes in hydrogen configurations induced by changes in protein surface charges at long distances,  said Kovalevsky.  This phenomenon may occur in other aspartic proteases, and perhaps in enzymes more generally.  With the recent improvements that have been made, the field of macromolecular neutron crystallography is expanding, with studies addressing a variety of important biological processes from protein-folding to antibiotic resistance and proton transport across biological membranes.","Published: May 24, 2016"

However, scientists are also increasingly recognizing that it can be used to activate the expression of genes. To that end, they have built a number of synthetic gene activating Cas9 proteins to study gene functions or to compensate for insufficient gene expression in potential therapeutic approaches. ""The possibility to selectively activate genes using various engineered variants of the CRISPR-Cas9 system left many researchers questioning which of the available synthetic activating Cas9 proteins to use for their purposes. The main challenge was that all had been uniquely designed and tested in different settings; there was no side-by-side comparison of their relative potentials,"" said George Church, Ph.D., who is Core Faculty Member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, leader of its Synthetic Biology Platform, and Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. ""We wanted to provide that side-by-side comparison to the biomedical research community."" In a study published on 23 May in Nature Methods, the Wyss Institute team reports how it rigorously compared and ranked the most commonly used artificial Cas9 activators in different cell types from organisms including humans, mice and flies. The findings provide a valuable guide to researchers, allowing them to streamline their endeavors. The team also included Wyss Core Faculty Member James Collins, Ph.D., who also is the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) s Department of Biological Engineering and Norbert Perrimon, Ph.D., a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. Gene activating Cas9 proteins are fused to variable domains borrowed from proteins with well-known gene activation potentials and engineered so that the DNA editing ability is destroyed. In some cases, the second component of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the guide RNA that targets the complex to specific DNA sequences, also has been engineered to bind gene-activating factors. ""We first surveyed seven advanced Cas9 activators, comparing them to each other and the original Cas9 activator that served to provide proof-of-concept for the gene activation potential of CRISPR-Cas9. Three of them, provided much higher gene activation than the other candidates while maintaining high specificities toward their target genes,"" said Marcelle Tuttle, Research Fellow at the Wyss and a co-lead author of the study. The team went on to show that the three top candidates were comparable in driving the highest level of gene expression in cells from humans, mice and fruit flies, irrespective of their tissue and developmental origins. The researchers also pinpointed ways to further maximize gene activation employing the three leading candidates. ""In some cases, maximum possible activation of a target gene is necessary to achieve a cellular or therapeutic effect. We managed to cooperatively enhance expression of specific genes when we targeted them with three copies of a top performing activator using three different guide RNAs,"" said Alejandro Chavez, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow and the study s co-first author. ""The ease of use of CRISPR-Cas9 offers enormous potential for development of genome therapeutics. This study provides valuable new design criteria that will help enable synthetic biologists and bioengineers to develop more effective targeted genome engineering technologies in the future,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and also Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

The single virus in this image is a human cytomegalovirus, a cousin of MCMV. It was obtained by chilling a sample down with liquid nitrogen and exposing it to high-energy electrons. Jean-Yves Sgro, U. of Wisconsin-Madison (EMD-5696 data Dai, XH et al., 2013)  Scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a new method to rapidly detect a single virus in urine, as reported this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Although the technique presently works on just one virus, scientists say it could be adapted to detect a range of viruses that plague humans including Ebola, Zika and HIV. ""The ultimate goal is to build a cheap, easy-to-use device to take into the field and measure the presence of a virus like Ebola in people on the spot,"" says Jeffrey Dick, a chemistry graduate student and co-lead author of the study. ""While we are still pretty far from this, this work is a leap in the right direction."" The other co-lead author is Adam Hilterbrand, a microbiology graduate student. The new method is highly selective, meaning it is only sensitive to one type of virus, filtering out possible false negatives caused by other viruses or contaminants. There are two other commonly used methods for detecting viruses in biological samples, but they have drawbacks. One requires a much higher concentration of viruses, and the other requires samples to be purified to remove contaminants. The new method, however, can be used with urine straight from a person or animal. The other co-authors are Lauren Strawsine, a postdoctoral fellow in chemistry; Jason Upton, an assistant professor of molecular biosciences; and Allen Bard, professor of chemistry and director of the Center for Electrochemistry. The researchers demonstrated their new technique on a virus that belongs to the same family as the herpes virus, called murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). To detect individual viruses, the team places an electrode   a wire that conducts electricity, in this case, one that is thinner than a human cell   in a sample of mouse urine. They then add to the urine some special molecules made up of enzymes and antibodies that naturally stick to the virus of interest. When all three stick together and then bump into the electrode, there's a spike in electric current that can be easily detected. The researchers say their new method still needs refinement. For example, the electrodes become less sensitive over time because a host of other naturally occurring compounds stick to them, leaving less surface area for viruses to interact with them. To be practical, the process will also need to be engineered into a compact and rugged device that can operate in a range of real-world environments. Support for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Welch Foundation and the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas.","Published: May 24, 2016"

Professors Lars Forsberg and Jan Dumanski, from the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology at Uppsala University, and colleagues from Sweden, France, the UK, the US and Canada, investigated loss of the Y chromosome in over 3200 men with an average age of 73, and an age range of 37-96. Around 17 percent of them showed LOY in blood cells, and this increased with age. The researchers found that those with an existing diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease (AD) had a higher degree of LOY, and that LOY was also a marker for the likelihood of developing the disease during the follow-up period.  The idea for this research project came to me when I was writing our first paper on the relationship between LOY and the development of non-blood cancers. In thinking about the process known as immunosurveillance   the body s ability to fight disease development throughout life   I found that it had been well studied in AD, and hence it occurred to me that LOY might be involved in this disease too,  says Lars Forsberg. Using standard molecular techniques, the identification of LOY in blood is easy to determine when it occurs in 10 percent or more of blood cells with a nucleus containing DNA. As well as being relatively common in older men, it also occurs less frequently in those who are younger. Since women do not carry a Y chromosome, and men have, on average, shorter lives, it is possible that LOY may be related to the earlier death of men. However, the researchers say, the mechanisms and causes for their findings are still not properly understood. They are currently investigating the functional effects of LOY, and looking at its role in different groups of men and in other diseases, in order to understand better which types of cancer are associated with LOY, as well as whether there is a link with early signs of dementia, for example mild cognitive impairment. Another question to be answered relates to how LOY in blood cells can be related to disease in other organs.  The blood cells we studied are involved in the immune system, and the fact that LOY in them is associated with disease in other tissues is striking. We therefore hypothesise that the loss of LOY in blood cells leads them to lose part of their immune function,  says Jan Dumanski. Previous research by the same group has shown that smoking greatly increases the risk of acquiring LOY, by as much as 400 percent. However, smoking appears to have a transient effect, and is also dose-dependent, so quitting could reverse the effect. This could be important to emphasise in smoking-cessation programmes, the researchers say. More difficult to tackle is the question of diagnosis and treatment of serious conditions such as AD and cancer. This is currently based on identifying clinical symptoms, and the development of diagnostic tools for their earlier detection could lead to strategies aimed at preventing their development before symptoms occur. For example, in the future it might be possible to use an LOY test to identify men at risk and then carry out oncological or neurological evaluations to try to detect early, mild, symptoms of disease. LOY might also become an important diagnostic tool in combination with other biomarkers that may be used to predict risks for various diseases.  The addition of LOY testing in the general population could give medical practitioners the possibility of using preventive strategies in men at risk. For example, in cancer, primary tumours are usually not deadly; it is the metastatic process that it normally responsible for deaths. If we could predict which men have an increased risk of cancer, we could watch them closely for the development of disease and also use appropriate preventive treatments. In short, the widespread use of LOY testing could radically decrease male mortality rates, and even perhaps eliminate the difference in life expectancy between the sexes,  says Lars Forsberg.","Published: May 24, 2016"

This is the first example of taking a genetic sequence and designing a drug candidate that works effectively in an animal model against triple negative breast cancer,  said TSRI Professor Matthew Disney.  The study represents a clear breakthrough in precision medicine, as this molecule only kills the cancer cells that express the cancer-causing gene not healthy cells. These studies may transform the way the lead drugs are identified by using the genetic makeup of a disease.  The study, published by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that the Disney lab s compound, known as Targaprimir-96, triggers breast cancer cells to kill themselves via programmed cell death by precisely targeting a specific RNA that ignites the cancer. Short-Cut to Drug Candidates While the goal of precision medicine is to identify drugs that selectively affect disease-causing biomolecules, the process has typically involved time-consuming and expensive high-throughput screens to test millions of potential drug candidates to identify those few that affect the target of interest. Disney s approach eliminates these screens. The new study uses the lab s computational approach called Inforna, which focuses on developing designer compounds that bind to RNA folds, particularly microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short molecules that work within all animal and plant cells, typically functioning as a  dimmer switch  for one or more genes, binding to the transcripts of those genes and preventing protein production. Some microRNAs have been associated with diseases. For example, microRNA-96, which was the target of the new study, promotes cancer by discouraging programmed cell death, which can rid the body of cells that grow out of control. In the new study, the drug candidate was tested in animal models over a 21-day course of treatment. Results showed decreased production of microRNA-96 and increased programmed cell death, significantly reducing tumor growth. Since targaprimir-96 was highly selective in its targeting, healthy cells were unaffected. In contrast, Disney noted, a typical cancer therapeutic targets and kills cells indiscriminately, often leading to side effects that can make these drugs difficult for patients to tolerate.  In the future we hope to apply this strategy to target other disease-causing RNAs, which range from incurable cancers to important viral pathogens such as Zika and Ebola,  added Research Associate Sai Pradeep Velagapudi, the first author of the study and a member of the Disney lab. In addition to Disney and Velagapudi, authors of the study,  Design of a Small Molecule Against an Oncogenic Non-coding RNA,  were Michael D. Cameron, Christopher L. Haga, Laura H. Rosenberg, Marie Lafitte, Derek Duckett and Donald G. Phinney of TSRI.

By redirecting that energy to a genetically modified part of the cell capable of producing various complex chemical materials, we induce the light driven biosynthesis of these compounds,"" says Post Doc Agnieszka Janina Zygadlo Nielsen, who along with colleagues Post Doc Thiyagarajan Gnanasekaran and PhD student Artur Jacek Wlodarczyk has been the main researcher behind the study. The researchers have as such modified microalgae genetically to become small chemical factories with a build in power supply. According to the research team's study, this basically allows sunlight being transformed into everything ranging from chemotherapy or bioplastics to valuable flavor and fragrance compounds. As Agnieszka Janina Zygadlo Nielsen describes, the problem with many of these substances today is namely that they are extremely expensive and difficult to make, and therefore produced only in small quantities in the medicinal plants. ""A cancer drug like Taxol for instance is made from old yew trees, which naturally produce the substance in their bark. It is a cumbersome process which results in expensive treatments. If we let the microalgae run the production this problem could be obsolete,"" she explains. Sustainable production from wastewater Thiyagarajan Gnanasekaran clarifies that the method can be run sustainably and continuously, and that this is what makes it even more spectacular compared to present methods.   ""Our study shows that it is possible to optimize the enzymatic processes in the cells using only sunlight, water and CO2by growing them in transparent plastic bags in a greenhouse. Theoretically, the water could be replaced with sewage water, which could make the process run on entirely renewable energy and nutrient sources. Recycling wastewater from industry and cities to produce valuable substances would surely be positive,"" he points out. Agnieszka Janina Zygadlo Nielsen adds: ""If we can create a closed system that produces the valued chemicals from water, sunlight and CO2, it would be a fully competitive method compared to the ones used today, where it is primarily extracted from plants or yeast and E. coli bacteria producing the substances. In theory it should be cheaper on the long run to use our method than adding the large quantities of sugar that the conventional yeast and E.coli cultures amongst other things need to function."" A method with revolutionizing perspectives  However, the research team emphasizes that the method using genetically modified microalgae has its limitations at present time. As Thiyagarajan Gnanasekaran points out, the microalgae use much of the harnessed sunlight to keep their own metabolic processes running: ""It is difficult to produce large quantities of the desired compounds in microalgae because they have to use a large amount of the produced energy for themselves, since they are fully photosynthetic organisms. Exactly for this reason, it makes good sense to have them produce the particularly valuable substances which are cost effective to produce in relatively small quantities at a time, as for instance medicine."" However, according to the team the expanding methods and genetic tools for microalgae are likely to overcome these limitations within near future.","Published: May 24, 2016"

This offer, based on Bayer s written proposal to Monsanto dated May 10, 2016, represents a substantial premium of:  - 37 percent over Monsanto s closing share price of USD 89.03 on May 9, 2016  - 36 percent over the three-month volume weighted average share price - 33 percent over the six-month volume weighted average share price  - Last twelve months EBITDA multiple of 15.8x as of February 29, 2016 The acquisition of Monsanto would be a compelling opportunity to create a global agriculture leader, while reinforcing Bayer as a Life Science company with a deepened position in a long-term growth industry. The combination is expected to provide Bayer s shareholders with accretion to core EPS by a mid-single-digit percentage in the first full year after closing and a double-digit percentage thereafter. Initially, Bayer expects annual earnings contributions from total synergies of approximately USD 1.5 billion after year three plus additional integrated offer benefits in future years.  We have long respected Monsanto s business and share their vision to create an integrated business that we believe is capable of generating substantial value for both companies  shareholders,  said Werner Baumann, CEO of Bayer AG.  Together we would draw on the collective expertise of both companies to build a leading agriculture player with exceptional innovation capabilities to the benefit of farmers, consumers, our employees and the communities in which we operate.  This transaction would bring together leading Seeds & Traits, Crop Protection, Biologics, and Digital Farming platforms. Specifically, the combined business would benefit from Monsanto s leadership in Seeds & Traits and Bayer s broad Crop Protection product line across a comprehensive range of indications and crops. The combination would also be truly complementary from a geographic perspective, significantly expanding Bayer s long-standing presence in the Americas and its position in Europe and Asia/Pacific. Customers of both companies would benefit from the broad product portfolio and the deep R&D pipeline.  Bayer is committed to enabling farmers to sustainably produce enough healthy, safe and affordable food capable of feeding the world s growing population,  said Liam Condon, member of the Board of Management of Bayer AG and head of the Crop Science Division.  Faced with the complex challenge of operating in a resource-constrained world with increasing climate volatility, there is a clear need for more innovative solutions that advance the next generation of farming. By supporting farmers of all sizes on every continent, the combined business would be positioned as the partner of choice for truly integrated, superior solutions.  Under the proposed transaction, the combined business would provide attractive opportunities for the employees of both companies and have its global Seeds & Traits and North American commercial headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, its global Crop Protection and divisional Crop Science headquarters in Monheim, Germany, and an important presence in Durham, North Carolina, as well as many other locations throughout the U.S. and around the world. Digital Farming for the combined business would be based near San Francisco, California. Bayer is highly confident in its ability to finance the transaction based on advanced discussions with and support from its financing banks, BofA Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse. The offer is not subject to a financing condition. Bayer intends to finance the transaction with a combination of debt and equity. The expected equity portion represents approximately 25 percent of the transaction s enterprise value and is expected to be raised primarily via a rights offering.  The strong cash flow generation of the combined business as well as Bayer s track record of disciplined deleveraging after large acquisitions would enable rapid deleveraging post-acquisition. This is in line with Bayer s target of an investment-grade rating immediately after closing of the transaction and its commitment to the single  A  credit rating category in the long term. Bayer has a successful track record of working with global authorities to secure the necessary regulatory approvals and has extensive experience integrating acquisitions from a business, geographic, and cultural perspective.  Bayer s Board of Management and Supervisory Board unanimously approved the proposal and are fully committed to pursuing the transaction. Bayer is prepared to proceed immediately to due diligence and negotiations and to quickly agree to a transaction. The transaction will be subject to customary closing conditions.","Published: May 24, 2016"

Inserting the targeted components from the donor immune cells back into the immune cells of the cancer patients, the researchers were able to make cancer patients' own immune cells recognize cancer cells. Rapidly developing The extremely rapidly developing field of cancer immunotherapy aims to create technologies that help the body's own immune system to fight cancer. There are a number of possible causes that can prevent the immune system from controlling cancer cells. First, the activity of immune cells is controlled by many 'brakes' that can interfere with their function, and therapies that inactivate these brakes are now being tested in many human cancers. As a second reason, in some patients the immune system may not recognize the cancer cells as aberrant in the first place. As such, helping the immune system to better recognize cancer cells is one of the main focuses in cancer immunotherapy.   Borrowed immune system Ton Schumacher of the Netherlands Cancer Institute and Johanna Olweus of the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital decided to test whether a 'borrowed immune system' could ""see"" the cancer cells of the patient as aberrant. The recognition of aberrant cells is carried out by immune cells called T cells. All T cells in our body scan the surface of other cells, including cancer cells, to check whether they display any protein fragments on their surface that should not be there. Upon recognition of such foreign protein fragments, T cells kill the aberrant cells. As cancer cells harbor faulty proteins, they can also display foreign protein fragments - also known as neo-antigens - on their surface, much in the way virus-infected cells express fragments of viral proteins. Unnoticed To address whether the T cells of a patient react to all the foreign protein fragments on cancer cells, the research teams first mapped all possible neo-antigens on the surface of melanoma cells from three different patients. In all 3 patients, the cancer cells seemed to display a large number of different neo-antigens. But when the researchers tried to match these to the T cells derived from within the patient's tumors, most of these aberrant protein fragments on the tumor cells went unnoticed. Donor T-cells Next, they tested whether the same neo-antigens could be seen by T-cells derived from healthy volunteers. Strikingly, these donor-derived T cells could detect a significant number of neo-antigens that had not been seen by the patients' T cells. Finding a match ""In a way, our findings show that the immune response in cancer patients can be strengthened; there is more on the cancer cells that makes them foreign that we can exploit. One way we consider doing this is finding the right donor T cells to match these neo-antigens."", says Ton Schumacher. ""The receptor that is used by these donor T-cells can then be used to genetically modify the patient's own T cells so these will be able to detect the cancer cells."" Clinical implications ""Our study shows that the principle of outsourcing cancer immunity to a donor is sound. However, more work needs to be done before patients can benefit from this discovery. Thus, we need to find ways to enhance the throughput. We are currently exploring high-throughput methods to identify the neo-antigens that the T cells can ""see"" on the cancer and isolate the responding cells. But the results showing that we can obtain cancer-specific immunity from the blood of healthy individuals are already very promising"", says Johanna Olweus.","Published: May 24, 2016"

Peach pits, which are hidden inside the nut-like husk, do in fact contain amygdalin, a substance which can degrade into hydrogen cyanide in the stomach. But peaches, apricots and almonds didn t develop this defence system to keep children from enjoying their fruit. It is actually nature s way of protecting plant seeds from being eaten by insects. Chemists from Wendelin Stark s research group at ETH Zurich have drawn inspiration from this and copied the defence system of bitter almonds and other members of the Prunus family in the lab. They are developing a coating for seeds that functions in the same way as this natural model and is just as effective, but doesn t impair seed germination and is also biodegradable. The study accompanying their work was recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Cyanide as a by-product of insect snacking To determine the efficacy of a coating, the researchers tested different layer sequences. The sequence that finally emerged as the most effective consists of several layers of polylactic acid (PLA), a substance that is harmless to both humans and the environment. The innermost layer contains an enzyme. On top of this lies a layer of pure polylactic acid, followed by two layers in which the hydrogen cyanide precursor amygdalin is embedded   the same substance found in the husks of bitter almond seeds. A final layer is composed of pure PLA. If an insect larva chews through these layers, the amygdalin is released, followed by the enzyme. The two substances mix together and the amygdalin breaks down into hydrogen cyanide, which kills the insect larva s appetite   or even the creature itself.Successful testing on insect pests In collaboration with the Julius K hn Institute in Berlin, the researchers have tested the efficacy of their treatment on a variety of cereal pests. The bitter almond defence system proved very effective against the larvae of the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), the Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella) and the lesser grain borer (Rhizopertha dominica). The lesser grain borer is a beetle that causes considerable damage to wheat stores worldwide. Significantly fewer fully grown beetles hatched on coated than uncoated seeds. They reproduced less successfully and the larvae grew more slowly because they had eaten less. However, the layering didn t keep absolutely all insects from feasting on the wheat grains: the treatment was not effective against the wheat weevil (Sitophilus granarius). This type of beetle does not lay its eggs on the grain, but instead bores a hole into it for the eggs and seals it up afterwards. The larvae then eat the wheat grain from the inside out, which means that they don t come into contact with the coating. In addition, the researchers were able to show in laboratory and fieldwork that the treatment did not impair the germination of wheat grains. In the lab, 98% of the coated grains germinated. In the field, the coated grains did germinate a little later than the uncoated ones, and the seedlings initially developed more slowly. Nonetheless, the wheat plants were able to recover this initial deficit later on. A possible replacement for pesticides  We've demonstrated that this new kind of coating method works: the grains are protected from being eaten by insects and are usable in the field,  explain the study's authors Carlos Mora and Jonas Halter. The treatment using this method is as straightforward as it is with spraying. Nor are the costs of the new method significantly higher than with insecticides. The ETH researchers are convinced that this kind of seed coating can be used on other kinds of crops too.  The method has the potential to replace certain synthetic pesticides,  believes Carlos Mora.  Not only is the coating biodegradable, but it also ensures that the seeds retain their quality in storage. ","Published: May 24, 2016"

Vendors specializing in delivering such complex automated solutions have predominantly served the needs of core automation groups in pharma and biotech associated with high throughput screening (HTS), profiling, compound management, large-scale cell culture and maintenance, and more recently biospecimen storage. However, for each of these core labs there are 1,000s of others  interested in more efficient ways to carry out routine, repetitive or demanding tasks. This is where the application of small-scale benchtop automation can offer numerous compelling advantages and make a big difference. Most of these potential automation opportunitieslabs only want to process a relatively small number of samples or batches of plates per run, making them ideal for benchtop systems. The emerging applications in sample prep (e.g. nucleic acid extraction, qPCR setup and the, quantification and normalization of genomic DNA samples, and next-generation sequencing) have accelerated the development of small automated workstations and look set to hasten the adoption of automation by many new or novice users. In November 2015 HTStec undertook a market survey on small-scale or benchtop automation mainly among research labs in academia, pharma and biotech. The study was initiated by HTStec as part of its ongoing tracking of the life science technology and marketplaces, and to update and extend HTStec s previous report on the topic published in January 2013.

That process   dependent on the careful selection of circulating virus strains and the identification of mutations in the part of the virus that recognizes host cells   could soon be augmented by a new approach. It would more precisely forecast the naturally occurring mutations that help seasonal flu virus dodge the vaccine. Writing this week (May 23, 2016) in the journal Nature Microbiology, a team of researchers led by University of Wisconsin Madison School of Veterinary Medicine virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka describes a novel strategy to predict the antigenic evolution of circulating influenza viruses and give science the ability to more precisely anticipate seasonal flu strains. It would foster a closer match for the so-called  vaccine viruses  used to create the world s vaccine supply. The approach Kawaoka and his colleagues used involved techniques commonly employed in virology for the past 30 years and enabled his group to assemble the 2014 flu virus before the onset of the epidemic.  This is the first demonstration that one can accurately anticipate in the lab future seasonal influenza strains,  explains Kawaoka, a UW Madison professor of pathobiological sciences who also holds a faculty appointment at the University of Tokyo.  We can identify the mutations that will occur in nature and make those viruses available at the time of vaccine (virus) candidate selection.  Influenza depends on its ability to co-opt the cells of its host to replicate and spread. To gain access to host cells, the virus uses a surface protein known as hemagglutinin which, like a key to a lock, opens the cell to infection. Vaccines prevent infection by priming the immune system to create antibodies that effectively block the lock, prompting the virus to reengineer the hemagglutinin key through chance mutation.  Influenza viruses randomly mutate,  notes Kawaoka.  The only way the virus can continue to circulate in humans is by (accumulating) mutations in the hemagglutinin.  To get ahead of the constant pace of mutations in circulating flu viruses, Kawaoka s group assembled libraries of human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from clinical isolates that possessed various natural, random mutations in the hemagglutinin protein. The viruses were then mixed with antibodies to weed out only those that had accumulated enough mutations to evade the antibody. Because the sources of the viruses were known, the patterns of mutation could be mapped using  antigenic cartography.  The mapping, says Kawaoka, identifies clusters of viruses featuring novel mutations which, according to the new study, can effectively predict the molecular characteristics of the next seasonal influenza virus. Such a prediction, says Kawaoka, could then be used to more effectively develop the vaccine virus stockpiles the world needs each flu season. Each year the World Health Organization (WHO), comparing genetic sequence and antigenic data, makes recommendations about which circulating strains of influenza will make the best matching vaccine. The method described by Kawaoka and his colleagues is conceptually different in that it mimics the mutations that occur in nature and accelerates their accumulation in the critical hemagglutinin protein.  Our method may therefore improve the current WHO influenza vaccine selection process,  Kawaoka and his group conclude in the Nature Microbiology report.  These in vitro selection studies are highly predictive of the antigenic evolution of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in human populations. ","Published: May 24, 2016"

The mutation is present in histones, the protein scaffolding around which DNA wraps. Researchers have known for some time that histones play a role in switching genes on or off in cells by exposing or covering up various parts of the genome, for instance. But they are just beginning to learn about how changes to these non-DNA structures can affect development and health a field known as epigenetics and how they are regulated. Now, for the first time, they ve shown that a change to the structure of a histone can trigger a tumor on its own.  This is the first study to show that a genetic change to non-DNA structures in the cell histones is enough to cause cancer, with no other cooperating DNA mutations,  says co-author Chao Lu, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of C. David Allis, Tri-Institutional Professor and Joy and Jack Fishman Professor in the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics at Rockefeller University. In earlier work, other researchers had found that in approximately 95 percent of samples of chondroblastoma, a benign tumor that arises in cartilage typically during adolescence, carry a mutation in a histone protein called H3. To explore whether and how the mutation causes the tumor, the researchers inserted the H3 histone mutation into mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), which generate cartilage, bone and fat. They then watched these mutant cells lose the ability to differentiate in the lab. Next, they injected the mutant cells into living mice, and the animals developed the tumors rich in MPCs, known as an undifferentiated sarcoma.  Although researchers knew that a certain type of tumor chondroblastoma carried a mutation in the H3 histone and no other mutation, this is the first study to show that the mutation indeed causes tumors, even without any other DNA mutation present,  says Lu. Next, the researchers tried to understand how the mutation causes the tumors to develop. They found that, when the mutation occurs, the cell becomes locked in a proliferative state meaning it divides constantly, leading to tumors. Specifically, the mutation inhibits enzymes that normally tag the histone with chemical groups known as methyls, allowing genes to be expressed normally. In response to this lack of modification, another part of the histone becomes over-modified, or tagged with too many methyl groups.  This leads to an overall resetting of the landscape of chromatin, the complex of DNA and its associated factors, including histones,  says co-author Peter Lewis, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Allis lab and currently an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This  resetting  is what locks the cell into its proliferative state. The findings suggest that researchers should be on the hunt for more mutations in histones that might be driving tumors, says Lu. Meanwhile, he and his colleagues are trying to learn more about how this specific mutation in histone H3 causes tumors to develop.  For instance, we want to know which pathways cause the mesenchymal progenitor cells that carry the mutation to continue to divide, and not differentiate into the bone, fat, and cartilage cells they are destined to become,  he says. Once researchers understand more about these pathways, says Lewis, they can consider ways of blocking them with drugs, particularly in tumors such as MPC-rich sarcomas which, unlike chondroblastoma, can be deadly. In fact, drugs that block the pathways may already exist and may even be in use for other types of cancers.  One long-term goal of our collaborative team is to better understand fundamental mechanisms that drive these processes, with the hope of providing new therapeutic approaches,  says Allis.

The researchers found that the  UV radiation Resistance Associated Gene  is a tumor suppressor for skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in the United States  and the deadliest. In fact, melanoma rates have doubled over the last three decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  If we understand how this UV-resistant gene functions and the processes by which cells repair themselves after ultraviolet damage, then we could find targets for drugs to revert a misguided mechanism back to normal conditions,  said Chengyu Liang, the study s senior author and an associate professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The study was published in Molecular Cell in time for Melanoma/Skin Cancer Detection and Prevention Month. More than 90 percent of melanoma skin cancers develop because of cell damage from exposure to UV radiation. Melanoma kills about 10,130 people annually, according to the American Cancer Society.  People who have the mutated UV-resistant gene or low levels of the UV-resistant gene may be at higher risk of melanoma or other skin cancers, especially if they go sunbathing or tanning frequently,  Liang said.  Our study suggests that the UV-resistant gene may serve as a biomarker for skin cancer prevention.  A shot in the cell The researchers used data from 340 melanoma patients who participated in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The study also included two experimental groups with either reduced levels of the UV-resistant gene or a mutant copy of that gene in melanoma cells and 50 fly eyes. The control groups were melanoma cells or fly eyes with normal copies of the UV-resistant gene. The scientists gave a UV shot to cells carrying the normal UV-resistant gene and cells carrying defective copies of it. After 24 hours, cells carrying normal versions of the gene had repaired more than 50 percent of the UV-induced damage. In contrast, the defective samples repaired less than 20 percent of the damaged cells.  That means when people sunbathe or go tanning, those who have the normal UV-resistant gene can repair most UV-induced DNA burns in a timely manner, whereas those with the defective UV-resistant gene will have more damage left unrepaired,  Liang said.  After daily accumulation, if they sunbathe or go tanning often, these people will have increased risk for developing skin cancers such as melanoma.  The researchers were able to show a correlation with increased cancer risk. Their study did not definitively say diminished levels or mutant copies of the UV-resistant gene were causes for skin cancer development. Why the UV-resistant gene matters Scientists first discovered the UV-resistant gene nearly two decades ago in relation to a disease called Xeroderma Pigmentosum, which makes people extremely sensitive to sunlight and puts them at high risk for developing skin cancer. Scientists did not examine the function of the UV-resistant gene in people who are healthy or who have skin cancer. The USC-led team has now identified what the UV-resistant gene does and how it operates in a general population, said Yongfei Yang, lead author and a research associate at Keck Medicine of USC.  The UV-resistant gene is a tumor suppressor involved in the UV-repair process of a cell s DNA and is essential for preventing UV-induced genomic instability,  Yang said.  When the UV-resistant gene is lost, the cell cannot efficiently repair UV- and chemical-induced damage.  The UV-resistant gene is involved in the multistep DNA cell-repair process, researchers found. First a known protein scans for damaged DNA. Once it finds lesions, it tags the UV-resistant gene into action. The UV-resistant gene is like a humanitarian convoy dropping off reinforcements or aid to help damaged areas repair at precisely the right time. The researchers did not have data from people without skin cancer, so they were unable to compare their observations of melanoma patients with those of skin cancer-free people.  We found the expression level of the UV-resistant gene is related to melanoma patients  survival and metastasis stages,  Yang said.  Lower levels of the UV-resistant gene means a lower survival rate and advanced metastases stages.  The UV-resistant gene brings hope UV exposure, frequent trips to the tanning salon and genetics all play a role in developing skin cancer. Studies have shown, for example, that redheads are more prone to skin cancer because of their genetic background. Liang, Yang and their colleagues have identified a new player in the skin cancer field.  To our knowledge, the UV-resistant gene does not have any enzymic activity; It s a supporter or coordinator,  Liang said.  Although it may not be the direct doer, without it, the whole structure collapses.  Future studies will use mouse models to better understand how the UV-resistant gene functions.  The UV-resistant gene may serve as a good target for drug development,  Yang said.  Perhaps one day a drug could stimulate the repairing functionality of the UV-resistant gene to ensure swift and effective repair of UV-damaged skin cells. That would be a good treatment for people who are at high risk of developing skin cancer. ","Published: May 23, 2016"

Cancer cells found in the inner core of all solid tumors   due to the abnormally low levels of oxygen they are in   must rely on the process of glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose for energy, to survive,  said Theodore Lampidis, Ph.D., a cancer researcher at Sylvester and lead author of the study.  These cells, by nature of their slow growth, have been found to be the most resistant to conventional cancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we showed that a false sugar such as 2-DG, which blocks glycolysis, selectively starves these slow-growing cancer cells while sparing normal cells, which can use other sources of energy, such as fats and proteins because they are fully oxygenated.  Although a Phase I clinical trial in which 2-DG was combined with a conventional anticancer drug proved successful, the toxic side effects of chemotherapy remained an issue. However, in this study, the team of scientists showed that by combining 2-DG with fenofibrate, a compound that has been safely used in humans for more than 40 years to lower cholesterol and triglycerides, the entire tumor could effectively be targeted without the use of toxic chemotherapy.  We found that the unique combination of 2-DG and fenofibrate simultaneously provoked two types of stress, known as energy and ER stress, which most cancer types cannot overcome,  said Lampidis, who is also professor of cell biology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Due to uncontrolled growth and to the abnormal micro-environment in which cancer cells exist, they are under more stress than normal, healthy cells. In addition to 2-DG taking advantage of the universal cancer trait of increased glucose uptake, adding fenofibrate effectively exploits a second common feature of cancers   increased stress.  We believe our findings effectively pave the way for using this combination to provide non-toxic treatments for a wide variety of cancers,  said Lampidis.","Published: May 23, 2016"

However, the most remarkable quality of this variation is that it confers greater protection against coronary heart disease than can easily be accounted for by the reduction in cholesterol alone. The variant   a twelve-letter deletion in the ASGR1 gene on chromosome 17   was discovered through the analysis of whole genome and clinical data from across the population of Iceland and was linked to an approximately 35% reduction in the risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. Its effect was then replicated in data from some 300,000 people in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. The finding provides robust evidence that developing drugs to inhibit the ASGR1 protein may offer a promising new means for lowering non-HDL cholesterol and preventing heart disease. The study is published today in the online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.  This is a discovery with direct application to improving the health of people around the world,  said Kari Stefansson, founder and CEO of deCODE and senior author on the paper.  This is now a proven paradigm for developing new medicines that Amgen, the parent company of deCODE, has exploited in the discovery of medicines to treat osteoporosis, coronary artery disease and migraine. The drug discovery work at Amgen targeting ASGR1 is already exciting. It is based not on a beautiful hypothesis or lucky chemistry but on the direct insight that human genetics provides into the underlying biology of disease   in this case an important and previously unknown mechanism for modulating non-HDL cholesterol and risk of the most common and deadly forms of heart disease.   We know we have put our finger on something fundamental when we find a single variant that confers on carriers an average one year of extra lifespan. Our unrivalled population resources and knowledge of genetics in Iceland put us in a privileged position to systematically discover such low-frequency variants. As our model expands to different corners of the globe, we expect to accelerate our discovery and validation efforts to many populations and all continental ancestries.

It contains the reduced form of the peptide glutathione (GSH), which reacts in a specific way when it comes into contact with the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), linked to Parkinson s, Alzheimer s and breast cancer, among other diseases. The GSH-GST reaction is detected by the transistor, which can be used for diagnostic purposes. The biosensor was developed as part of a FAPESP-funded Thematic Project entitled  Development of novel strategic materials for integrated analytical devices . The project focuses on the development of point-of-care devices by researchers in a range of knowledge areas, using functional materials to produce simple sensors and microfluidic systems for rapid diagnosis.  Platforms like this one can be deployed to diagnose complex diseases quickly, safely and relatively cheaply, using nanometer-scale systems to identify molecules of interest in the material analyzed,  explained Carlos Cesar Bof Bufon, Head of LNNano s Functional Devices & Systems Lab (DSF) and a member of the research team for the project, whose principal investigator is Lauro Kubota, a professor at the University of Campinas s Chemistry Institute (IQ-UNICAMP).  In addition to portability and low cost, the advantages of the nanometric biosensor include its sensitivity in detecting molecules, according to Bufon.  This is the first time organic transistor technology has been used in detecting the pair GSH-GST, which is important in diagnosing degenerative diseases, for example,  he explained. ""The device can detect such molecules even when they re present at very low levels in the examined material, thanks to its nanometric sensitivity.  A nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter (10-9 meter), or one millionth of a millimeter. The system can be adapted to detect other substances, such as molecules linked to different diseases and elements present in contaminated material, among other applications. This requires replacing the molecules in the sensor with others that react with the chemicals targeted by the test, which are known as analytes.  LNNano s Functional Devices & Systems division has developed several platforms for chemical, physical and biological sensing in areas of strategic importance both at home and abroad, such as health, environment and energy,  Bufon said.

In a study just published in the journal Nature, Andrew G. Myers and colleagues describe  a platform where we assemble eight (chemical) building blocks by a simple process to make macrolide antibiotics  without using erythromycin, the original macrolide antibiotic, and the drug upon which all others in the class have been based since the early 1950s. Erythromycin, which was discovered in a soil sample from the Philippines in 1949, has been on the market as a drug since 1953.  For 60 years, chemists have been very, very creative, finding clever ways to  decorate  this molecule, making changes around its periphery to produce antibiotics that are safer, more effective, and overcome the resistance bacteria have developed,  said Myers, Amory Houghton Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology in Harvard s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology.  That process is semisynthesis, modifying the naturally occurring substance.  In contrast, the process described in the Nature study involves using  eight industrial chemicals, or substances derived from them,  Myers said, manipulating them in various combinations and then testing the products against panels of disease-causing bacteria. This allows for  new compounds in fewer steps than was previously possible.  Ian H. Seipel, who was a postdoctoral fellow in Myers  lab and now is at the School of Pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco, and Ziyang Zhang, a Myers postdoctoral fellow, are first authors on the report. For a host of reasons, from the difficulty of developing antibiotics to the relatively low return on investment they offer, by 2013 the number of international pharmaceutical companies developing antibiotics had dwindled to four. In addition, in each five-year period from 1983 through 2007, the number of new antibiotics approved for use in the United States decreased, from 16 at the beginning of that period to only five by its end. One thing that has complicated antibiotic development is federal agencies  perceived reluctance to fund the research. In fact, Myers said, his new antibiotic development system would have been impossible without support from a Harvard alumnus and his wife who are interested in science, and Harvard s Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator.  I was making a presentation to a group of visiting alumni interested in science, and one, Alastair Mactaggart, asked me about funding. I told him I had no funding, because at that time we didn t, and he followed me back to my office and said,  This is ridiculous: We have to do something about this.  Myers said that without the support of Mactaggart and his wife, Celine, and the Gustavus and Louise Pfeiffer Research Foundation, the new platform would not exist.  And the Blavatnik accelerator funding was also hugely important,  he added The Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator awarded funding to Myers  project in 2013, enabling synthesis and testing of compounds. In 2015, with support from Harvard s Office of Technology Development, Myers founded Macrolide Pharmaceuticals, which has licensed the synthesis platform and aims to commercialize novel antibiotics for serious infections.  One of the things that s quite encouraging about the data in our paper is that some of the structures we ve made are active against clinical bacterial strains that are resistant to every known macrolide,  Myers said. In fact, he added, two of the 350 compounds reported on in the Nature paper have, in initial testing, shown efficacy against a bacterium that had become resistant to vancomycin,  which is known as the antibiotic of last resort. And if you have a bug that s resistant to vancomycin, you re in trouble,  Myers added.  This is an early effort,  Myers said of his lab s work with the new drug-development system.  We have a lot of work ahead of us.  Some of the 350 compounds reported on in the paper will undergo more extensive testing to evaluate their potential as candidate drugs. Myers cautioned that the road from drug candidate to treatment at the bedside is long, arduous, and expensive. First comes the initial identification of possible compounds.  Microbiologists evaluate those against panels of bacteria,  said Myers.  Hopefully your panels contain clinically relevant strains that are found in hospitals.  If an effective compound is found, it must be advanced. First researchers make sure it s not toxic to human cells in the lab; then they see how stable it is in human plasma; next come animal studies, typically in rodents to see if it can cure infection. And then come the three phases of human studies.  I said to a friend the other day that I m really pleased this paper is out,  Myers said.  My students worked unbelievably hard to make this happen. But if this is where this ends, I won t be satisfied. Our objective from day one was to have a drug in the clinic. ","Published: May 23, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/immune-cells-remember-their-first-meal-197884,Immune Cells Remember Their First Meal Scientists at the University of Bristol have identified the trigger for immune cells  inflammatory response   a discovery that may pave the way for new treatments for many human diseases  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Immune cells play essential roles in the maintenance and repair of our bodies.  When we injure ourselves, immune cells mount a rapid inflammatory response to protect us against infection and help heal the damaged tissue.  Lead researcher Dr Helen Weavers, from the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences said:  While this immune response is beneficial for human health, many human diseases (including atheroscelerosis, cancer and arthritis) are caused or aggravated by an overzealous immune response. A greater understanding of what activates the immune response is therefore crucial for the design of novel therapies to treat these inflammatory disorders.  Our study found that immune cells must first become  activated  by eating a dying neighbouring cell before they are able to respond to wounds or infection. In this way, immune cells build a molecular memory of this meal, which shapes their inflammatory behaviour.  The team s research, published in the journal Cell, used the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to study how a particular immune cell (the macrophage) becomes activated in order to respond to injury or infection.  Using the fly allowed researchers to make time-lapse movies of the dynamic behaviour of the immune cells as they migrate within a living organism.  It also allowed them to easily manipulate different genes and signalling pathways within the fly, to test which genes are important for immune cell behaviour. Using genetics, the researchers dissected the mechanism by which the molecular memory is generated within the immune cell.  Ingestion of the dying cell activates signalling via a calcium flash, which leads to an increase in the amount of an important damage receptor Draper in the immune cell.  High levels of this receptor enable the  primed  immune cell to sense the damage signals that entice them towards a wound during inflammation.  Without this priming, the cells are blind to wounds and infections.               Professor Paul Martin said:  Our work has important implications for human health, given that the pathology of many human diseases is often caused by an inappropriate inflammatory response.  Understanding how one signal (in this case a dying cell) can influence the ability of an immune cell to respond to a subsequent signal is a major step towards finding novel ways to clinically manipulate immune cells away from sites of the body where they are causing the most damage.  Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow Professor Will Wood said:  Using flies to study human disease might seem at first glance to be a rather strange approach, but this is an exciting advance in our understanding of immune cell behaviour, and takes us a step closer to designing novel therapeutic ways to influence immune cell behaviour within patients in the clinic.

The tests are particularly common among breast and ovarian cancer patients. However, questions remain about the growing list of mutations and their suspected, but unproven association with breast and ovarian cancer risk. In a new study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, a team led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania s Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) found that expanding the panel beyond the known breast/ovarian cancer-specific genes in these patients does not add any clinical benefit. Instead, testing for additional cancer susceptibility genes produced more questions than answers for breast and ovarian cancer patients. Genetic panels sometimes reveal mutations in genes that are associated with an increased risk in developing cancer. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes are prime examples, and those results may prompt women to opt for mastectomies and ovary removal surgery, which greatly decrease their risk of developing those cancers. However, there is not yet guidance for clinicians on how to care for patients who exhibit other types of mutations, such as those in CHEK2 and ATM. To determine if there was a benefit to expanding the gene panel to include non-breast/ovarian cancer and even non-cancer susceptibility genes, the team, led by Katherine Nathanson, MD, a professor of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, associate director of Population Science and Chief Oncogenomics Physician for the ACC, performed whole exome sequencing and then analyzed an 180 gene panel (including 25 breast/ovarian cancer specific-susceptibility genes, 123 other cancer-susceptibility genes, and 32 genes related to cardiovascular disease risk) in 404 individuals in 253 families with breast and/or ovarian cancer. This project was done in collaboration with researchers from the Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and City of Hope as part of the SIMPLEXO (Simplifying Complex Exomes) consortium. The study also evaluated the clinical utility of a variant classification methodology based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to help define mutations. These guidelines were recently published by the ACMG partly to address the inconsistencies in the classification of mutations among clinical laboratories. However, a  real world  methodology using the guidelines in cancer susceptibility had not been well studied or reported. The analysis underscores the complexities of genetic testing and counseling, which only continues to increase in world. Additionally, genetic testing identifies far more mutations, some referred to as  variants of uncertain significance,  or VUS, that clinicians know very little about or how to act on. Using the ACMG guidelines, the team identified 1,605 variants, and found that 11 percent of the patients without BRCA 1/2 mutations had clinically actionable mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes. Most confer a moderate increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer; only two additional families had mutations in non-breast cancer susceptibility genes (ATR and MSH6). Further, 12 percent of patients had VUSs in the well-established breast cancer susceptibility genes. When the non-breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes were included as well, however, the VUS rate jumped significantly: 78 percent of families had variants with no known clinical significance.  Adding on the additional cancer susceptibility genes to the  breast cancer susceptibility  genes opened up more questions than it answered,  Nathanson said.  This study therefore adds to prior findings of ours, and demonstrates little incremental utility to testing non-breast cancer susceptibility genes in breast cancer families.  The team also looked at the rate of mutations and VUSs in genes associated with cardiovascular disease risk, which are recommended for return of results by the ACMG as  secondary findings.  They found very few families with clinically actionable mutations. They also found some carriers of autosomal recessive cancer susceptibility gene mutations. Adding all the genes together, 95 percent of patients had at least one VUS or mutation identified, and nearly 30 percent of patients had five or more VUSs.  These findings add layers of complexity in counseling for cancer risk,  said the study s first author Kara Maxwell, MD, PhD, an instructor in the division of Hematology/Oncology.  A patient would now be expected to understand not only that a genetic finding could be found that may or may not be related to the cancer in their family, but that genetic variants could be found that may or may not put themselves and their family members at risk for a disease they weren t even thinking about at the time.  According to the researchers, the methodology they developed to apply the ACMG guidelines was of clinical utility and worked well to classify known variants.

This study called AAMBI (Asphyxia Associated Metabolite Biomarker Investigation) is designed as verification study. It aims to confirm in human the metabolite biomarker combinations obtained from previous animal studies. The asphyxia test under development will be the first to early and reliably diagnose brain damage caused by perinatal asphyxia, i.e. oxygen deficit during birth.  This ethics vote and our existing partner clinics featuring sufficient annual case numbers now enable us to take this most meaningful step in our recent company history  Ron Meyer, InfanDx  CEO happily states. Throughout the upcoming six months early postnatal blood samples shall be taken from 80 newborns suffering from moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy (NE/ brain damage) plus healthy controls. After completion of recruitment results of metabolomics testing of these samples will be compared with the clinically diagnosed status of the children. The concept of the deferred and clinically disconnected analytics allows to already now plan for the next large validation study for which recruitment and sampling shall be run partly parallel to AAMBI study and which is designed to serve for performance evaluation.  If things go well, InfanDx will deliver a wonderful Christmas present to us as the conclusion of this study will mark a significant leverage in corporate valuation  assumes Dr. J rg Fregien, CEO of LSI, which currently incubates InfanDx. Perinatal asphyxia may occur before, during or after delivery. While it is extremely difficult to diagnose asphyxia with newborns immediately after birth still about 40% of babies who suffered brain damage are not identified early enough. This situation is especially frustrating as most of these children could be helped through therapeutic hypothermia, a controlled cooling therapy that critically needs to be started earliest possible within the first 6 hours after birth. Only in this short therapeutic time window this treatment has proven to be effective and to avoid lifelong disabilities such as cerebral palsy/spasticism, blindness and other forms of neurological impairments. Worldwide and each year >1 mio. babies suffer from NE, which makes it within the delivery period the largest single cause for lifelong morbidity. The biomarkers developed by the InfanDx-project will be the first diagnostic tool to reliably identify the babies in need early enough.","Published: May 21, 2016"

For over 15 years, Goodwin Biotechnology has been one of the pioneers in providing development and GMP manufacturing of a broad portfolio of ADC projects, including cytotoxic ADCs, Radio Immunoconjugates, Antibody  Peptide Conjugates, Antibody Dye Conjugates, PEGylated proteins, other bioconjugates, and even Biobetters,  said Muctarr Sesay, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and VP, Bioconjugation Development at Goodwin Biotechnology.  Our experience in Bioconjugation has resulted in several patents and publications, as well as proprietary processes that enable us to help our clients overcome some significant challenges in developing their next generation of ADCs. Given the increasing interest in conjugating highly cytotoxic products (e.g., anti cancer drugs) to enhance the efficacy of ADCs, we have added a dedicated ISO 7 Cytotoxic Process facility for Proof of Concept, development, Tox and cGMP manufacturing to address unmet clinical needs.   We have built a very productive relationship with Goodwin Biotechnology over the past 18 months,  said Jostein Dahle PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Nordic Nanovector ASA, a Norway based, biopharmaceutical company.  They listen closely and are responsive to our needs. This collaborative approach is helping to develop a flexible manufacturing process for the successful GMP production of antibody radionuclide conjugates, or ARCs, for clinical trials with potential for future commercial scale up.   I have found that working with the team at Goodwin Biotechnology has been a great pleasure,  noted Miguel Garcia Guzman, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Aspyrian Therapeutics, a California based, clinical stage biotech company.  We were originally impressed by their expertise in Bioconjugation. This perception was reinforced by the flexible and solutions oriented approach to the complexity of our project, a first in class, precision targeted therapy for cancer. They treated our product as theirs as they orchestrated a flexible and well run process in successfully generating Tox and cGMP materials, which performed well in preclinical animal studies and on going human clinical trials. As a result, we secured our firm s first IND submission, which was a crucial milestone for our company. It speaks about the quality, timeliness, and process economics that Goodwin Biotechnology puts into every aspect of their work.   We collaborate with many of our clients in the early stages of proof of concept/development of the conjugation process by empirically recommending the appropriate linkers, payloads, and the bioconjugation chemistries and processes to create a viable ADC candidate. We then blend that with a solutions oriented approach to help our clients overcome significant challenges, including aggregation, especially that associated with IgM antibodies and conjugates, multiparameter optimization, optimizing drug to antibody ratios (DAR), working with antibody fragments, purification challenges, drug solubility issues, process scalability and economics, etc.,  Dr. Sesay continued.  We have developed proprietary processes to help address many of those challenges. We have also overcome the challenges associated with random conjugations with site directed conjugation of radionuclide chelators and other payloads and ligands to antibodies which results in narrower DAR (drug to antibody mole ratios), improved conjugate binding and, hopefully, an enhanced therapeutic index.   We are proud of the expertise that we have developed in area of Bioconjugation and the successful work that we have done with over 40 client projects over more than a decade,  said Karl Pinto, Chief Executive Officer at Goodwin Biotechnology, Inc.  Goodwin continues to invest strategically in our Bioconjugation business in order to enhance the breadth and depth of what we can offer to our clients. These Bioconjugation capabilities complement our over 23 years of experience in manufacturing monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, and vaccines through mammalian cell culture expression systems. So, as part of our Single Source Solution , Goodwin is uniquely qualified to partner with our clients to develop customized and flexible approaches for manufacturing the  naked  antibodies, then follow with the appropriate conjugation activities to cost effectively address their needs and deliver their ADC candidates on time.

These findings, coupled with the novel imaging technique, hold great potential in shaping how assisted reproduction procedures such as In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)[1] and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)[2] are performed, and making these procedures more effective. Across the globe, more women are relying on assisted reproduction procedures. Singapore alone, for example, has carried out over 6000 assisted reproduction cycles in 2015, an increase of more than 1000 cycles from 2012[3] .Current IVF procedures assess whether an embryo is suitable for implantation into the mother largely through observable measurements such as gauging if the rate of growth of the embryo is normal. PGD of embryos, on the other hand, is carried out by analysing a randomly extracted embryonic cell for genetic defects, with the assumption that all cells within a preimplantation embryo are identical and that the removal of a single embryonic cell would not affect the overall development of the embryo after implantation. Contrary to the current conception that every cell within a preimplantation embryo is identical, the team of researchers at IMCB has demonstrated that the cells are in fact differentiated and may play very different roles in later development. By designing new cutting-edge real-time imaging techniques, the researchers were able to examine every cell within a preimplantation mouse embryo without perturbing its development. They observed differences in the way which certain proteins in each cell bind to their target genes. The scientists also observed that there were variances in cell behaviour at every stage of the embryo's development. As mouse embryos bear strong resemblance to human embryos at early stage development, the findings indicate that cells within a preimplantation human embryo are also not identical. The study, therefore, refines our understanding of early stage embryonic development and highlights how assisted reproduction procedures such as IVF and PGD may be further enhanced to ensure successful fertilisation, smooth pregnancy and childbirth. Further development of the real-time imaging technique may eventually enable fertility specialists to study the microscopic properties of embryos and decide more precisely if an embryo is suitable for implantation, or screen an embryo for genetic abnormalities using imaging lasers instead of physical manipulation. This would enable better quality control of embryos implanted in mothers hence potentially increasing the chances of success for these procedures through more efficient control of embryo quality. Dr Nicolas Plachta, Senior Principal Investigator of IMCB, said, ""Most laboratories conduct studies on embryonic cells via invasive methods which do not keep the embryo alive. Our lab is the only one in the world imaging single cells in live mammalian embryos at the quantitative level, which allows us to observe every cell within an embryo at every stage of its development. Our findings as a result of this advanced technique have put forth a new paradigm of knowledge that would encourage more detailed microscopic analysis for future assisted reproduction procedures."" Dr Sadhana Nadarajah, Director of KKIVF Centre and Senior Consultant, Department of Reproductive Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said, ""This novel method of screening embryos is indeed exciting. If it can be successfully used on human embryos, without affecting its successive growth, it will improve the technique of embryo selection in IVF."" Prof Hong Wanjin, Executive Director of IMCB, said, ""In many developed countries like Singapore, women are having children later in their lives, which has been linked to declined fertility. As such, assisted reproduction procedures needs to be constantly improved and made more reliable to help women successfully conceive and sustain a healthy birth rate. Nicolas and his dedicated team of researchers have therefore made a significant breakthrough that could benefit the society greatly."" The study was published in the top-tier scientific journal, Cell, and was also featured as the cover of the journal.

Mayo Clinic researchers reviewed the cases of a dozen adult patients diagnosed with coprophagia over the past 20 years and found that the behavior is associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly neurodegenerative dementias. The findings are published in the Journal of Neurology. Of the dozen patients with coprophagia diagnosed at Mayo Clinic from 1995 to 2015, half had dementia. In those two decades, Mayo Clinic evaluated 67,000 patients with a dementia diagnosis. This yields a frequency of reported coprophagia cases in dementia of about 1 per 10,000 people. See Also: Being underweight in middle age associated with increased dementia risk While coprophagia is rare in humans, it is also likely underreported, says lead author Keith Josephs, MD, a behavioral neurologist at Mayo Clinic. He encourages families and caregivers who see the behavior to reach out to patients' care teams for help. ""Know that there is treatment available,"" Dr. Josephs says. ""Your loved one doesn't have to be removed from the assisted living or nursing home environment."" Behavioral modifications, such as restrictive clothing and drug therapy with antiepileptics and antidepressants, were tried to treat the coprophagia. An antipsychotic drug may be needed to stop the behavior, the study authors say, noting that the antipsychotic medication haloperidol stopped the behavior in four patients. Brain scans of the six dementia patients showed medial temporal lobe atrophy, including the amygdala, had moderate to severe atrophy. The cause of degeneration was unknown, although one patient who had died with a brain autopsy showed a type of brain degeneration known as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Dr. Josephs says. In the other six patients without dementia, age, seizures or metabolic changes were potential culprits.

Few know that better than Ann-Marie Broome, PhD, who feels nanotechnology holds the future of medicine with its ability to deliver powerful drugs in tiny, designer packages. Her latest research finds the perfect application - targeting cancerous brain tumor cells. Results from her recent paper published online in the international journal Nanomedicine - Future Medicine found that a lipid nanocarrier engineered to be small enough to get past the blood-brain barrier could be targeted to deliver a chemotherapeutic drug more efficiently to tumor cells in the brain. In vivo studies showed specific uptake and increased killing in glial cells, so much so that Broome initially questioned the results. See Also: Magnetic nanoparticles could stop blood clot-caused strokes ""I was very surprised by how efficiently and well it worked once we got the nanocarrier to those cells,"" she said, explaining that initial results were so promising that she had her team keep repeating the experiments, using different cell lines, dosage amounts and treatment times. Researchers and clinicians are excited because it potentially points the way to a new treatment option for patients with certain conditions, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the focus of this study. Dr. Ann-Marie Broome, right, likes collaborating with Dr. Amy Lee Bredlau, left, who brings a clincial perspective to the laboratory. Credit: Sarah Pack  Glioblastoma multiforme is a devastating disease with no curative options due to several challenges, said Broome, who is the director of Molecular Imaging of the Medical University of South Carolina's (MUSC's) Center for Biomedical Imaging and director of Small Animal Imaging of Hollings Cancer Center. The brain tumor has a significant overall mortality, in part due to its location, difficulty of surgical treatment and the inability to get drugs through the blood-brain barrier, a protective barrier designed to keep a stable environment within and surrounding the brain. In 40 percent of cases, standard treatments will extend life expectancy 4 to 7 months. ""It's really a dismal outcome. There are better ways to deliver standard of care."" That's where Broome and her nanotechnology lab enter in. Nanotechnology is medicine, engineering, chemistry, and biology all bundled together and conducted at the nanoscale, between the range of 1 to 1,000 nanometers. For comparison, a thin newspaper page is about 100,000 nanometers thick. Broome and her team took what they know about the cancer's biology and of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), one of numerous growth factor proteins that regulates cell growth and division and is also overexpressed on tumor cells in the brain. With that in mind, they engineered a micelle that is a phospholipid nanocarrier, ""a bit of fat globule,"" to deliver a concentrated dose of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) to the GBM tumor cells. ""Micelles of a certain size will cross the blood-brain barrier carrying a concentrated amount of TMZ,"" she explained about how the nanotechnology works. ""The PDGF is used much like a postal address. The micelle gets it to the street, and the PDGF gets it to the house."" This targeting ability is important because researchers have learned that it's likely that the GBM will recur, she said. Learn More: New nanoparticle gene therapy strategy effectively treats deadly brain cancer in rats ""It's thought that satellite cells left behind after surgical removal are the fastest growing and most dangerous ones. We're trying to kill those rapidly growing satellite cells that will grow into new tumors in that location or others. These satellite tumors grow more aggressively than others. You have to hit them hard, fast and aggressively."" Surprisingly, nanotechnology is already a part of everyday life in many ways that people don't realize. It's used in everything from makeup as moisturizers or UV sunscreens to ice cream to maintain frozen temperatures and creamy textures. In medicine, Broome said, researchers construct nanocarriers that are stable and stealthy. ""Your immune cells can't attack them. They remain hidden.""When the package gets to where it's going, nanotechnologists have various methods to get the micelles to release their payloads- one way is to use the acidic nature of a rapidly growing tumor. In normal circulation, the pH of blood is slightly alkaline and the micelle stays intact. What researchers have discovered is that in many tumor types, the pH drastically changes to an acidic environment. ""While the tumor is growing, it creates waste by-products and metabolites that alter the pH, thus lowering it. As the center becomes more necrotic, it becomes even more acidic."" The change in pH triggers a release of the drug from our micelles just where clinicians want it to go to reduce toxicity to the rest of the body, she said. ""We take advantage of the tumor's natural environment as well as the cellular expression. I'm a big proponent of understanding that microenvironment has an impact on how well you can treat tumors. It's probably why so many therapeutics fail - because you have to take into account the immune system, the local environment, and the cells themselves - all three of these are important considerations."" That's why nanotechnology has an edge in shaping future cancer treatments. ""It's very important that the public recognize that nanotechnology is the future. It impacts so many different fields. It has a clear impact on cancer biology and potentially has an impact on cancers that are inaccessible, untreatable, undruggable - that in normal circumstances are ultimately a death knell.""All too familiar with this is researcher and clinician Amy Lee Bredlau, MD, director of MUSC Health's Pediatric Brain Tumor Program, who also was a part of the study. Broome said she relishes having a clinician's perspective in the lab to focus the group on translational outcomes for the patients. ""That's why it's so gratifying working with Amy Lee. She works with many cancers for which there are no options. We're trying to provide options."" Bredlau agreed. ""This paper is exciting because it demonstrates a novel approach to treating brain tumors, combining nanotechnology targeting to a marker of brain tumors with a specialized delivery system. It will allow us eventually to target aggressive childhood and adult brain tumors."" Bredlau said she's taking time out from her clinical practice to be in Broome's research lab because she knows that's how she can best accelerate the process. ""I am passionate about improving the lives of my patients, now and in the future. Advancing research now is the best way to improve the lives of my patients to come."" Don't Miss: New combination treatment strategy to 'checkmate' glioblastoma Bredlau sees nanotechnology as having the power to revolutionize treatment for brain tumors. ""When we perfect this strategy, we will be able to deliver potent chemotherapies only to the area that needs them. This will dramatically improve our cure rates while cutting out a huge portion of our side effects from chemotherapy. Imagine a world where a cancer diagnosis not only was not life-threatening, but also did not mean that you would be tired, nauseated or lose your hair."" Though excited by the study's results, Broome cautions that there's much more work to be done before new treatment options are readily available for patients. ""It may or may not be effective for all types of GBMs. There are subtypes as well as therapeutic-resistant GBMs that these nanocarriers may not impact. We need to continue rigorous testing to verify and validate our initial findings."" They will be exploring an expanding field of targeted biomarkers available for GBM tumor cells. As is common in breast cancer and other cancer types, this cancer has specific cell surface receptors that are overexpressed, she said. And though the drug TMZ in this protocol works very efficiently, it may not be the best drug for the majority of the people, she said. ""Now that we know we can get the drug to its designated location and get it to work efficiently, we have a comparator. We can test more lethal and different combinations of drugs that have never before been used in this scenario."" This method of drug delivery also opens new windows to immunotherapy treatments garnering recognition internationally. Broome wants to take chemotherapeutics and combine them with new immuno-therapeutic treatments to form unique combination delivery packages. It's ambitious. Related: Epigenetic driver of glioblastoma provides new therapeutic target Broome, whose team jokes that she keeps ""a long, running list of impossible tasks,"" said the work also translates to so many fields beyond cancer including stroke, transplant and regenerative medicine, where it could be used for example in wound healing in dermatology or organ maintenance in transplantation. It's one reason she submitted her latest research to an international journal because she wants to accelerate advances in nanotechnology, a field she has no doubt will change how medicine is done. ""They are the primary reason I continue to do what I do,"" she said of the patients who face grim diagnoses. ""They give me hope. The possibilities for nanotherapeutics are endless and bright.""

Dementia affects older age groups with a greater frequency, and as our population ages, the burden of dementia on public health is rapidly increasing. See Also: Researchers open  Golden Window  in deep brain imaging The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for 60 to 80 per cent of total cases. Much effort has been put into understanding its causes since, although still incurable, an early diagnosis can slow the progression of the disease, improving the quality of life of patients and their families. Neuroimaging has proven as a very useful tool in the quest for detecting ad alleviating symptoms of dementia, allowing an in vivo assessment of the structural and functional properties of the brain, providing relevant data for the diagnostic task. Currently, the use of computational techniques to analyze neuroimaging data has provided us with unprecedented insight of the process of neurodegeneration in AD. In new work published in Current Alzheimer's Research, researchers propose a new framework for dementia diagnosis, namely spherical brain mapping (SBM) that performs a projection of three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) brain images onto two-dimensional maps revealing statistical characteristics of the tissue. Learn More: Epigenomics of Alzheimer s disease progression These maps can contain both meaningful features such as cortical thickness or surface and radial statistical features of the tissues, such as average, entropy, etc. The resulting maps perform a significant feature reduction that will allow further supervised or unsupervised processing, reducing the computational load while maintaining a large amount of the original information. This framework achieves a performance up to 91% accuracy in a differential diagnosis involving Alzheimer-affected subjects versus controls belonging to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Dr. Susanne Wolf of the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) discovered this in tests on mice and published her findings in the journal Cell Reports. The research findings are of significance when it comes to the effects of using antibiotics in the long term, and could also help to alleviate the symptoms of mental disorders. See Also: Finnish study establishes connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease The gut and the brain ""talk"" to one another via hormones, metabolic products or direct neural connections. A specific population of monocyte immune cells acts as a further link between the two, as Dr. Susanne Wolf from the MDC research group led by Prof. Helmut Kettenmann recently discovered in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Magdeburg, the Charit  - Universit tsmedizin Berlin, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The researchers switched off the gut microbiome in mice, i.e. their intestinal bacteria, with a strong concoction of antibiotics. Compared to the mice that had not undergone treatment, they subsequently observed significantly fewer newly formed nerve cells in the hippocampus region of the brain. The memory of the treated mice also deteriorated because the formation of these new brain cells - a process known as neurogenesis - is important for certain memory functions. As well as impaired neurogenesis, the researchers also found that the population of a specific immune cell in the brain the Ly6C(hi) monocytes decreased significantly when the microbiota was switched off. Could these immune cells be a previously unknown intermediary between the two organ systems? Wolf and her team tested and confirmed this hypothesis: when they removed just these cells from the mice, neurogenesis declined and when they gave the cells to the mice that had been on antibiotics, neurogenesis increased once again. The researchers cured the antibiotic-treated mice using two different strategies: the mice were either given a mixture of selected bacterial strains or had access to voluntary training in the running wheel, thus reversing the negative effects of the antibiotics. The mice's number of monocytes increased and their memory performance and neurogenesis improved. However, it was not possible to restore the immune and brain functions using the microbiota of untreated mice. Learn More: Scientists show a link between intestinal bacteria and depressionAccording to Wolf, the previously unknown intermediary function of the immune cells is of particular scientific interest: ""With the Ly6C(hi) monocytes, we may have discovered a new general communication path from the periphery to the brain."" Applied to humans, the findings do not show that all antibiotics disrupt brain function, as the combination of drugs used in the study was extremely potent. ""It is possible, however, that similar effects could result from treatments involving long-term use of antibiotics,"" says Wolf. The research team also found that the antibiotics may affect neurogenesis directly, and not act only via the gut bacteria. According to Wolf, the new study is also of significance for treating people with mental disorders such as schizophrenia or depression, who also have impaired neurogenesis: ""In addition to medication and physical exercise, these patients could potentially also benefit from probiotic preparations. In order to test this, we would like to conduct clinical pilot studies together with the Charit ."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The new information adds to our understanding of how the human face evolved and may help contribute to forensic DNA technologies that build visual profiles based on an individual s genetic makeup. The study, published today in Nature Communications, analysed a population of over 6,000 people with varied ancestry across Latin America to study the differences in normal facial features and identify the genes which control the shape of the nose and chin. The researchers identified five genes which play a role in controlling the shape of specific facial features. DCHS2, RUNX2, GLI3 and PAX1 affect the width and pointiness of the nose and another gene   EDAR   affects chin protrusion.  Few studies have looked at how normal facial features develop and those that have only looked at European populations, which show less diversity than the group we studied. What we ve found are specific genes which influence the shape and size of individual features, which hasn t been seen before.  Finding out the role each gene plays helps us to piece together the evolutionary path from Neanderthal to modern humans. It brings us closer to understanding how genes influence the way we look, which is important for forensics applications,  said the first author of the report, Dr Kaustubh Adhikari, (UCL Cell & Developmental Biology). People have different shaped facial features based on their genetic heritage and this is partly due to how the environment influenced the evolution of the human genome. The nose, for example, is important for regulating the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe in so developed different shapes in warmer and cooler climates.  It has long been speculated that the shape of the nose reflects the environment in which humans evolved. For example, the comparatively narrower nose of Europeans has been proposed to represent an adaptation to a cold, dry climate. Identifying genes affecting nose shape provides us with new tools to examine this question, as well as the evolution of the face in other species. It may also help us understand what goes wrong in genetic disorders involving facial abnormalities,  explained Professor Andr s Ruiz-Linares (UCL Biosciences), who led the study. The team collected and analysed DNA samples from 6,630 volunteers from the CANDELA cohort recruited in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. After an initial screen, a sample size of 5,958 was used. This group included individuals of mixed European (50%), Native American (45%) and African (5%) ancestry, resulting in a large variation in facial features. Both men and women were assessed for 14 different facial features and whole genome analysis identified the genes driving differences in appearance. A subgroup of 3,000 individuals had their features assessed using a 3D reconstruction of the face in order to obtain exact measurements of facial features and the results identified the same genes. The study identified genes that are involved in bone and cartilage growth and the development of the face. GLI3, DCHS2 and PAX1 are all genes known to drive cartilage growth   GLI3 gave the strongest signal for controlling the breadth of nostrils, DCHS2 was found to control nose  pointiness  and PAX1 also influences nostril breadth. RUNX2 which drives bone growth was seen to control nose bridge width. The genes GLI3, DCHS2 and RUNX2 are known to show strong signals of recent selection in modern humans compared to archaic humans such as Neanderthals and Denisovans; GLI3 in particular undergoing rapid evolution.

That summarizes a promising new drug-making technique designed to reduce serious allergic reactions and other side effects from anti-cancer medicine, testosterone and other drugs that are administered with a needle. Developed by University at Buffalo researchers, the breakthrough removes potentially harmful additives   primarily soapy substances known as surfactants   from common injectable drugs.  We re excited because this process can be scaled up, which could make existing injectable drugs safer and more effective for millions of people suffering from serious diseases and ailments,  says Jonathan F. Lovell, a biomedical engineer at UB and the study s corresponding author. The work was described in a study,  Therapeutic Surfactant-Stripped Frozen Micelles,  was published today in the journal Nature Communications. Pharmaceutical companies use surfactants to dissolve medicine into a liquid solution, a process that makes medicine suitable for injection. While effective, the process is seldom efficient. Solutions loaded with surfactant and other nonessential ingredients can carry the risk of causing anaphylactic shock, blood clotting, hemolysis and other side effects. Researchers have tried to address this problem in two ways, each with varying degrees of success. Some have taken the so-called  top down  approach, in which they shrink drug particles to nanoscale sizes to eliminate excess additives. While promising, the method doesn t work well in injectable medicine because the drug particles are still too large to safely inject. Other researchers work from the  bottom up  using nanotechnology to build new drugs from scratch. This may yield tremendous results; however, developing new drug formulations takes years, and drugs are coupled with new additives that create new side effects. The technique under development at UB differs because it improves existing injectable drug-making methods by taking the unusual step of stripping away all of the excess surfactant. In laboratory experiments, researchers dissolved 12 drugs   cabazitaxel (anti-cancer), testosterone, cyclosporine (an immunosuppressant used during organ transplants) and others   one at a time into a surfactant called Pluronic. Then, by lowering the solution s temperature to 4 degrees Celsius (most drugs are made at room temperature), they were able to remove the excess Pluronic via a membrane. The end result are drugs that contain 100 to 1,000 times less excess additives.  For the drugs we looked at, this is as close as anyone has gotten to introducing pure, injectable medicine into the body,  says Lovell, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering in UB s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  Essentially, it s a new way to package drugs. ","Published: May 20, 2016"

The technology could allow researchers to track the cells in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during preclinical and clinical trials. The findings are published by Scientific Reports. Stem cells, with their ability to regenerate into a multitude of different cell types, show great promise for treating a number of diseases and injuries. Stem cells taken from a patient s own body are of particular interest, due to a decreased chance of rejection. These cells are most commonly harvested from the bone marrow, which contains two types of stem cells, hematopoietic and mesenchymal. Hematopoietic stem cells can be used to form the different types of blood cells, and are used to treat leukemia and multiple myeloma. Mesenchymal stem cells can be used to generate bone, cartilage and fat cells, and have promise for repairing bone and cartilage, damaged heart cells, and treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.   Currently, there are more than 360 registered clinical trials that use MSCs, but the results have been mixed, with some patients reacting well and others not responding to the stem cell treatment. To understand why these results can be so variable, researchers need to be able to track the stem cells as they migrate through the body to see if they reach and graft to the appropriate site. To do this, researchers could label the stem cells with a superparamagnetic iron-oxide (SPIO) contrast agent and image the patient using MRI. Ferumoxytol is the only SPIO nanoparticle that has been approved by the FDA, but researchers have not been able to label MSCs with Ferumoxytol in cell culture (ex vivo) without the help of a transfection agent. Transfection agents are undesirable because they can change the cells  biology and inhibit their effectiveness. Furthermore, researchers have had difficulty culturing the large amount of cells needed for clinical dosing. Current methods also result in cells of different sizes and functionalities. Smaller, round cells are preferable because they show a higher capacity for regeneration and differentiation. To surmount these problems, Ho and colleagues took advantage of the cell s natural ability to engulf and internalize Ferumoxytol in vivo. Ho s team developed a  bio-mimicry  method to create an environment in a petri dish that is much like the environment found inside the body. His team began by using traditional methods to extract cells from bone marrow, separate the MSCs from the other cells and expand the number of MSCs. His team then devised a new way to culture MSCs by introducing other cells from the bone marrow, mimicking the in-vivo environment. The resulting MSCs retain their optimal size and regeneration capabilities and can internalize Ferumoxytol for cell tracking. Because MSCs are multi-potent, this new methodology can prepare more native cells for applications in cell therapy and regenerative medicine.","Published: May 20, 2016"

The draft LCDs are posted to the Medicare Coverage Database on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website, and propose to establish reimbursement coverage for eligible prostate cancer patients to help determine which patients can be conservatively managed rather than treated with definitive surgery or radiation therapy.  These draft LCDs represent another significant milestone for ProMark, moving Metamark closer to our goal of ensuring that all prostate cancer patients have greater access to additional, critical information about their disease aggressiveness so they can make an appropriate and personalized treatment decision,  said Jerry Williamson, President and CEO.  The draft LCDs closely follow ProMark s inclusion in the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines1 in March, further demonstrating the growing adoption of ProMark as a meaningful prognostic tool in the care of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.  ProMark predicts cancer aggressiveness in patients with biopsy Gleason Scores of 3+3 and 3+4, providing a fully independent and individualized prediction that the cancer can be managed without aggressive treatment, or an indication that therapy may be appropriate.","Published: May 20, 2016"

In addition to serving as the global electronic lab notebook (ELN), the Pennsylvania-based bioanalytical (BA) laboratory is implementing the IDBS BA solution as its lab execution system. These workflow configurations will ensure end-to-end compliance, quality, and traceability across the GLP laboratory.  Far too many paper-based processes and storage requirements have led to challenges in our business. With IDBS  E-Workbook, we expect to very quickly see around a 40% increase in efficiency, and that will get even better over time,  said Azhar Kalim, VP of Business Development at Frontage. ""Sample analysis will be streamlined by electronically tracking all material and reagents and deploying real-time QC to ensure compliance with the bioanalytical method. The end result will be higher quality and faster turnaround of incurred sample results."" The leading drug development platform will help Frontage eliminate paper and drive best practice by automating BA processes across the lab. With E-Workbook, Frontage will be able to implement an 'Audit by Exception' paradigm across all bioanalytical studies. Analysts will be guided through validated workflows covering material preparation to equipment management. Kalim added;  We have 52 mass spectrometers currently, soon growing to 56. The old process was like trying to drive a very fast car on a poor quality road. After a lot of investigation into ELN solutions, IDBS was the obvious partner for us. Having limited the workflow customization required, we expect to be completely up and running in Pennsylvania very quickly. It s not creating a whole new range of processes: E-Workbook fits well with our current processes, so it is a more streamlined, faster overlay on our existing ways of working.  A key differentiator for achieving higher quality results and faster timelines is the deployment of the IDBS lab execution system (LES). Such systems build on paper-replacement technologies like simple electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) and extend LIMS capabilities, in order to drive lab processes. Frontage Labs is looking to innovate BA lab operations by approaching BA operations from a quality and compliance focused perspective. The deployment of E-Workbook as a single platform to manage end-to-end operations within the BA lab is also a step toward integrating diverse CRO capabilities, such as integrated sample registration and tracking, from Phase 1 clinical study to DMPK and even CMC (product development) support. ""Working faster and smarter is key, as labs are increasingly partnering with contract research organizations (CROs) and innovative biotech s to deliver results,  said Michael Hampton, Vice President, North American Operations at IDBS.  With E-Workbook 10, Frontage is using cutting-edge technology and a single informatics platform to facilitate validated method execution and asset tracking across the organization. The use of E Workbook 10 will dramatically reduce study cycle-time and deliver high-quality results.  E-Workbook 10 will deliver a common informatics platform across all Frontage business units to maintain data integrity and security. It will also integrate with existing lab technology to streamline workflows. The CRO will roll out E-Workbook 10 across its other global sites over the coming year.","Published: May 20, 2016"

For producers and consumers of some of the most expensive kinds, this is a big problem. Generic versions abound, but the traditional variety comes from only a handful of Italian provinces and commands twice the price.  In February, news stories emerged about grated Parmigiano Reggiano, or parmesan, cheese containing cellulose as a filler and different, less expensive cheeses. One product labeled as 100 percent parmesan reportedly contained none. For consumers interested in artisanal products, this meant there was no way to know what they were getting at the store. To address this, the European Union established a system to grant a  protected denomination of origin,  or PDO, designation to certain products. In the case of Parmigiano Reggiano, cheeses with the PDO label must meet certain requirements. For example, they must be made out of milk from cows that are not fed silage, a fermented cereal product often used in animal feed. Augusta Caligiani and colleagues wanted to see if detecting compounds associated with these diets would be an effective way to determine the authenticity of PDO-labeled parmesan. The researchers analyzed more than 300 samples of cheeses using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method to see if it could help differentiate cheeses from cows fed silage and those that were not. The team found that samples of Grana Padano, a cheese similar to parmesan but made with milk from cows allowed to eat silage, contained cyclopropane fatty acids. However, these fatty acids were not in PDO parmesan samples. The researchers also could tell if a blend of the two cheeses contained 10 percent or more of Grana Padano. Because the method is simple and fast, the researchers say it could be used in industry to screen large numbers of samples for potential adulteration.","Published: May 20, 2016"

Coble s presentation was heavy on the statistics, and this created a lot of work for the translators. It took two of them, working tag-team, to keep up. Coble is a scientist at the U.S. Department of Commerce s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and an expert in forensic DNA analysis. Before NIST, he was the research director at the U.S. Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, where he supported U.S. efforts to identify the remains of servicemen killed in Vietnam and other wars.   Today, Vietnam is undertaking a similar effort to identify its war dead, and Coble was in Hanoi this April presenting the latest methods to Vietnamese scientists.    The U.S. solved a lot of cases,  Coble said, including many that became solvable only in the last decade as research led to powerful new techniques for analyzing DNA.  But the Vietnamese are at the beginning of the process.    That process is likely to be a long one. The war left 300,000 Vietnamese unaccounted for, their remains either missing or unidentified. That process will also be a very personal one.  Many of the scientists who participated in the workshop were children during the war, and they and their families experienced it firsthand,  Coble said.   For these scientists, the project may have great historical and personal significance, but it is also presents some difficult technical challenges.   Extracting Information from Degraded DNA  For example, scientists create a genetic profile by looking at stretches of DNA that repeat themselves, like the same word typed over and over again. These sections are called short tandem repeats, or STRs, and the number of repeats in each STR varies from person to person.  By measuring the length of several different STRs, forensic analysts generate a series of numbers that are like a code. In the FBI s national DNA database, for instance, a genetic profile is made up of a series of numbers that can be used to identify an individual or vastly narrow the range of suspects.   But in tropical countries such as Vietnam, soils tend to be acidic, which hastens the decomposition of DNA. When that happens, the STRs fall apart like a ribbon cut to pieces, and scientists might only be able to measure a handful of them not enough to generate a unique genetic profile.  Improved Accuracy in DNA Typing  Coble worked on this problem in the years following the events of 9/11, when investigators had to identify human remains that were exposed to intense heat, which also causes DNA to fragment. Coble and several colleagues at NIST identified miniSTRs ones so short that they are more likely to remain intact even as the larger DNA fragments around them degrades. This advance allowed scientists to identify remains that would have otherwise been impossible to identify.  Coble discussed miniSTR testing with his Vietnamese counterparts. The technique is useful in many situations. Because they allow for more precise and accurate matching, miniSTRs have also begun to be used in criminal investigations. For instance, three of the miniSTRs identified by NIST scientists in the years after 9/11 will be required when uploading DNA profiles to the FBI s national DNA database starting Jan. 1, 2017.  But for one week in April, Coble stepped away from his research at NIST to share his knowledge. It was his first trip to Vietnam.   Coble s trip was organized by the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program of the U.S. Department of Justice, which helps foreign governments develop professional and transparent law enforcement institutions. That program is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Defense.   A Shared Language  If it s true that war can dehumanize one s enemies, then perhaps giving fallen enemies a name can humanize them again. If so, Coble s trip, and other efforts like it, are especially fitting gestures of peace between formerly warring nations.  In fact, the assistance that Coble offered the Vietnamese runs in both directions. When U.S. specialists excavate sites in Vietnam to search for the remains of U.S. servicemen, Vietnamese experts participate in the work.  But whatever the deeper meaning of this exchange, Coble said that in the classroom, it was just a bunch of scientists sharing ideas.    We didn t speak the same language, and we didn t have the same experience in terms of history,  Coble noted.  But we were speaking the language of science, and that helped to transcend the differences. ","Published: May 20, 2016"

Members of Rice s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics have developed a model of how cancer cells twist a complex system of signals and feedback loops to their advantage. These signals help the cells detach from primary tumors and form clusters that lead to often-fatal metastatic disease. The Rice team reported in 2015 that the notch signaling pathway that involves proteins known as  notch,   jagged  and  delta  can be hijacked by cancerous cells. In normal operation, the mechanism is critical to embryonic development and wound healing and typically activates when a delta ligand of one cell interacts with the notch receptor of another. Their new paper in The Royal Society journal Interface advances the theory that cancer cells use these proteins, particularly jagged, to not only establish two-way signals that turn them into hybrid epithelial mesenchymal cells but also to form mobile clusters.  In general, our interest has been in the decision cells make by which they leave the primary tumor,  said Rice theoretical biological physicist Herbert Levine.  The epithelial cells are in the primary tumor are aberrant. Still, they look like normal cells, even though they re growing where they shouldn t. But cancer only turns truly deadly when cells leave and start new growths elsewhere in the body.  Because notch signaling is such a common function, the researchers suspected it could be repurposed by rogue cells.  We ve argued over the last couple of years that cells make active cell-fate decisions to become motile and leave the tumor. This paper addresses the extent to which cells coordinate their decisions with each other,  he said. The study led by Levine, Rice colleague Jos  Onuchic and former Rice researcher Marcelo Boareto offers cancer researchers a new target to consider as they seek ways to disrupt the process of metastasis. Notch signaling that starts in one cell triggers the transition of a neighboring cell, for instance, allowing a stem cell to reconfigure one of its neighbors for a specific function.  You have cells that are senders and cells that are receivers,  Onuchic said.  By doing that, they can differentiate. They can make their partners to be different than they are.  But in cancer, cells can act both as receivers and senders, especially when they change the primary ligand to jagged.  It turns out jagged increase is the smoking gun,  he said. Not only does the higher number of jagged proteins help create these motile hybrid cells, the increase also helps the hybrids exchange information to make sure that all the cells that are able will clump into a group, he said.  Biologists usually don t think about the differences between the ligands,  Boareto said.  But there s a large difference. The main message of the paper is simple: Notch-delta signaling leads to isolated cells undergoing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to motile individuals, and notch-jagged leads to groups of cells undergoing EMT to motile clusters.  The researchers suspected such transitions aren t random.  Now we know they aren t just reactions to the environment,  Levine said.  They re often due to cells communicating and making collective decisions.  To test these ideas, he said, co-author Sendurai Mani of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center will use cancer tissue samples to quantify the presence of jagged and other related proteins over the next few years. Onuchic said it was not surprising that cancer cells use notch pathways and probably other pathways as well.  Cancer never creates a complete new mechanism in biology,  he said.  It uses existing mechanisms to fulfill its needs. Learning how that happens can provide new clues for preventing metastasis.  Even if the discovery doesn t immediately apply to therapies, it could help diagnose the severity of a tumor by quantifying its expression of notch, jagged and delta proteins.  It gives us something to measure to predict more accurately how dangerous a primary tumor is,  Levine said.","Published: May 20, 2016"

This formal international partnership will expand the scientific collaboration between Avera and VU. Avera also announces the launch of the first and only twin register in South Dakota, the Avera Twin Register, as a result of its experience and association with the Netherlands study.  Avera scientists are working with other top scientists to transform the future of science, and the future of medicine,  said Fred Slunecka, Chief Operating Officer for Avera Health. The power of twins research is unparalleled when it comes to learning how much of a certain trait or disease is related to genetics and how much of it is related to environment   the age-old nature-versus-nurture debate. By collecting and analyzing the DNA of twins   with a simple cheek swab   Avera researchers will have the unique opportunity to learn how environment (lifestyle, diet, relationships, etc.) and genetics impact the development of certain traits and diseases.  We look at twins because they have nearly identical DNA. Why does one twin get a disease and the other doesn t? That s what we are studying. We look at both the genetics and environmental influences on diseases such as type 1 diabetes, behavioral disorders and cardiovascular disease,  said Gareth Davies, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and Scientific Director at the Avera Institute for Human Genetics. Through its research, the Avera Twin Register hopes to gain understanding of how genes influence human traits and diseases, which may allow for more accurate diagnosis, the development of better treatments and possibly the prevention of diseases. With the launch of the Avera Twin Register, the AIHG can now collect and analyze DNA from twins throughout the Midwest to provide insight about traits and diseases that are specific to the region.  Genetic research provides the foundation for the future of medicine and we re only beginning to scratch the surface of the potential that is waiting to be discovered  says Dave Kapaska, DO, President and CEO of Avera McKennan Hospital & University Center.  We re excited to see what we ll learn through the Avera Twin Register and how it will benefit the health and well-being of generations to come.  The Avera Twin Register is a division of the Avera Institute for Human Genetics, which has a history of excellence in innovative genetics research. Since 2009, the AIHG has partnered with the world s leading twin register, the Netherlands Twin Register, to collect and analyze over 80,000 DNA samples.  Along with the twin studies, Avera and VU will be working on several scientific collaborative projects, including the exchange of staff between Avera and VU, a joint PhD program, large-scale genotyping of the twins collection, deep sequencing and phenotyping of thousands of twin pairs, and the creation of an Avera/VU bioinformatics team. The Avera Institute for Human Genetics will continue to serve as the genetics lab for all genotyping for the Netherlands Twin Register and future genetics research in partnership with VU.  In genetics, collaboration is the norm. Each population doesn t have the cohorts and resources to achieve the next breakthrough, so we need to work together and I m excited to do that with Avera,  said Dr. Dorret Boomsma, internationally recognized scientist in twin and genetic studies of behavior, health and psychopathology at VU and founder of the Netherlands Twin Register.

Urothelial carcinoma accounts for 90% of all bladder cancers and can also be found in the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.  Tecentriq is a new medicine that can work with the immune system to treat people with a type of bladder cancer that progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy,  said Sandra Horning, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development.  We thank the scientists, doctors, patients and their families who made it possible to bring Tecentriq to people with advanced urothelial carcinoma.  The FDA s Accelerated Approval Program allows conditional approval of a medicine that fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition, based on early evidence suggesting clinical benefit. The indication for Tecentriq is approved under accelerated approval based on tumour response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. approval of Tecentriq is based on the phase II IMvigor 210 study. Roche is also evaluating Tecentriq in a confirmatory phase III study (IMvigor 211), which compares Tecentriq to chemotherapy in people whose bladder cancer has progressed on at least one prior platinum-containing regimen.","Published: May 20, 2016"

Some tumors have the assistance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a diverse type of immune cell involved in the suppression of the body s response against tumors. How breast cancer cells recruit MDSCs is not completely understood, but in a paper released in Nature Cell Biology, Baylor College of Medicine researchers report a new mechanism that helps cancer cells engage MDSCs.  There are alternative paths a tumor may take without the MDSCs, but those cancer cells that take the mTOR path of activity tend to have more MDSCs through the production of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which drives the accumulation of MDSCs,  said corresponding author Dr. Xiang Zhang, a McNair Scholar and assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology at Baylor College of Medicine. Knowing how cancer cells and MDSCs interact with each other helps researchers understand the events that may lead to tumor growth and metastasis and identify potential therapeutic targets. For instance,  determining that a patient s tumor is using the mTOR pathway would indicate that the cancer cells are more likely to depend on MDSCs for progression,  said Zhang, who also is with the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor.  This information suggests that, in this case, available therapies for mTOR combined with therapies for MDSCs represent potential therapeutic strategies.  Tumors that do not use the mTOR signaling pathway would not be expected to respond as well to the same therapies. The discovery of Zhang and colleagues is much in line with the concept of personalized medicine.  People talk about the specific mutations one patient s tumor has that are not in another patient s tumor. The same type of tumors having different mutations may warrant different treatments; that is personalized medicine,  explained Zhang.  We are trying to come from a different angle. We are trying to enrich this concept by saying that not only tumor-intrinsic characteristics are different from patient to patient, but, related to that, there is also diversity in terms of the immune components. Different tumors may evolve via different characteristics of the tumor and the immune response.  MDCSs are just one type of aberrant immune cell associated with the tumor.  In addition, there are other immune cells associated with the tumor   monocytes, macrophages, different subsets of T cells   that can either attack or help the tumor. All those cells may vary from patient to patient, and we don t really understand that yet,  said Zhang. In addition, MDSCs also play a role in non-cancer situations. For instance, in chronic inflammation, these cells try to suppress the inflammation; in this case, they play a pro-health role. So,  simply eliminating all MDSCs to treat cancer may likely result in negative side effects, such as autoimmune disease. That s why it s necessary to further characterize the diversity, to find the specific subsets of MDSCs that are tumor specific,  said Zhang.

Another 16.4 million Americans are expected to have difficulty seeing due to correctable refractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) that can be fixed with glasses, contacts or surgery. The researchers were led by Rohit Varma, M.D., director of the University of Southern California s Roski Eye Institute, Los Angeles, and published their analysis May 19th in JAMA Ophthalmology. They estimate that 1 million Americans were legally blind (20/200 vision or worse) in 2015. Having 20/200 vision means that for clear vision, you would have to be 20 feet or closer to an object that a person with normal vision could see from 200 feet away. Meanwhile, 3.2 million Americans had visual impairment in 2015   meaning they had 20/40 or worse vision with best possible correction. Another 8.2 million had vision problems due to uncorrected refractive error.  These findings are an important forewarning of the magnitude of vision loss to come. They suggest that there is a huge opportunity for screening efforts to identify people with correctable vision problems and early signs of eye diseases. Early detection and intervention   possibly as simple as prescribing corrective lenses   could go a long way toward preventing a significant proportion of avoidable vision loss,  said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. Over the next 35 years, Varma and his colleagues project that the number of people with legal blindness will increase by 21 percent each decade to 2 million by 2050. Likewise, best-corrected visual impairment will grow by 25 percent each decade, doubling to 6.95 million. The greatest burden of visual impairment and blindness will affect those 80 years or older as advanced age is a key risk factor for diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and cataract. The researchers analyzed data on visual impairment and blindness from six large studies: the Beaver Dam Eye Study (Beaver Dam, Wisconsin), Baltimore Eye Survey and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study (Maryland), the Chinese American Eye Study (Monterey Park, California), Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, and Proyecto VER (Nogales and Tucson, Arizona). They used the 2014 census and population growth projections to estimate the nationwide prevalence of vision impairment and blindness now and in 2050. In terms of absolute numbers, non-Hispanic whites, particularly white women, represent the largest proportion of people affected by visual impairment and blindness, and their numbers will nearly double. By 2050, 2.15 million non-Hispanic white women are expected to be visually impaired and 610,000 will be blind.  Based on these data, there is a need for increased screening and interventions across all population, and especially among non-Hispanic white women,  Varma said. African Americans currently account for the second highest proportion of visual impairment, but that is expected to shift to Hispanics around 2040, as the Hispanic population   and particularly the number of older Hispanics   continues to grow. Hispanics have particularly high rates of diabetes, which is associated with diabetic eye disease, a treatable cause of visual impairment. African Americans, meanwhile, are expected to continue to account for the second highest proportion of blindness.  African Americans are at disproportionately high risk for developing glaucoma, a potentially blinding eye disease that typically causes the loss of peripheral, but not central vision, so people tend to not realize that they are losing their vision and do not seek treatment,  he said. The study was funded in part by NEI grants U10EY017337-05 and K23EY022949-01. NEI leads the federal government s research on the visual system and eye diseases. NEI supports basic and clinical science programs that result in the development of sight-saving treatments and address special needs of people with vision loss.","Published: May 20, 2016"

The discovery, published in the journal Neuron, establishes for the first time that microglia can diminish the adverse changes to neural circuitry brought on by the chronic use of cocaine and has significant implications for developing an effective treatment for addiction. See Also: Cocaine addiction, craving, relapse: paradigm shift in treatment holds promise, thanks to epigenetics Microglia may not be as well known as neurons, the brain cells that relay messages, but they have many important functions. They constantly monitor their environment, and can act to maintain normal brain functioning. When they find something amiss, they can produce molecules that instruct neurons to make adaptive changes to their connections. One such example is the inflammatory molecule known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). ""What we discovered is that cocaine activates these microglia, which causes the release of an inflammatory signal which then tries to reverse the changes that cocaine is inducing in the neurons,"" says the study's senior author, Dr. David Stellwagen, a researcher from the Brain Repair and Integrative Neuroscience at the RI-MUHC and associate professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University. Using a mouse model, researchers detected this microglia-mediated reversal by looking at how TNF acts on a particular set of synapses in the brain. ""These connections are really important for regulating the behavior response in animal models to drugs of abuse such as cocaine,"" says co-first author Sarah Konefal, a McGill PhD student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience in Dr. Stellwagen's lab. The team found that TNF suppresses specific synaptic changes caused by cocaine-changes that are thought to underlie addiction. But Dr. Stellwagen explains that this beneficial mechanism doesn't last. ""The microglia response fades over time. One of the things that could transition somebody from just casual use into chronic dependency might be the fading of this adaptive signal which then allows the drugs to solidify their change to the neural circuitry."" Learn More: Novel compound halts cocaine addiction and relapse behaviors So can microglia be enticed to keep going? To find out, the team used a pharmaceutical agent that stimulates microglial production of TNF. Researchers observed that a cocaine-induced behavioral change in mice, the progressive increase in movement induced by cocaine,-was reduced in the animals who received this agent. This exciting result holds promise for one day developing treatments that could cut down on drug relapse rates, which can run as high as 80 per cent. As Dr. Stellwagen puts it, ""If we could develop a treatment that would suppress the craving that addicts have in stressful situations, or when they are re-exposed to situations in which they'd normally be taking the drug, that may allow them to avoid relapse. And that's really the therapeutic goal of the work we have been doing."" Dr. Stellwagen and colleagues are now investigating if the stimulated release of TNF can actually suppress cravings for cocaine. They are also hopeful that this work can be applied to other addictive substances including alcohol and methamphetamine. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Humans, however, don't have the same raw computational power; we have to efficiently create and execute a plan.

See Also: Artificial intelligence that imitates children s learning ""The idea is basically to understand how humans or animals make long-term decisions,"" says Jan Balaguer, a PhD student at University of Oxford and member of Google DeepMind. ""We're interested in trying to find machine-learning solutions to difficult tasks and real-life problems. Quite often it can be useful to draw inspiration from neuroscience."" Balaguer and his colleagues used a navigational game as a proxy to decode the human brain's decision-making processes. On a virtual subway system analogous to the London Underground, each station stop represented an individual step, while the different colored subway lines represented a higher level of the hierarchy. Twenty-two participants were trained on the game and then given a destination station as a goal, and played while in an fMRI scanner. The researchers examined whether participants focused more on the subway lines or on the individual stations while navigating in the game. The team found that, generally, brain activity and response time increased with the number of line changes standing between participants and their destinations, rather than with the number of stations themselves. The areas in the brain linked to this type of decision making were the dorsal portion of the medial prefrontal cortex, which is known to support higher cognitive functions such as planning, and the premotor cortex, which is more involved in the execution of real or imaginary movements. Related: Human behavior simulator ""We show, in a more straightforward and direct manner than previous studies, that there are hierarchical representations reflected in the brain,"" says Balaguer. However, there were some parts of the brain that became more active as participants inched closer to achieving their goal, with fewer stations left on a single line: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. In previous work, the hippocampus has been shown to react to proximity to a given goal. Overall, Balaguer says, ""We want to see how the human brain implements things like hierarchical structures in order to design more clever algorithms. In machine learning, having a hierarchical representation for decision making might be helpful or harmful depending on whether you choose the right hierarchy to implement in the first place.""

""Parental instinct appears to be hardwired, yet no one talks about how this instinct might include cognition,"" says David Haley, co-author and Associate Professor of psychology at UofT Scarborough. ""If we simply had an automatic response every time a baby started crying, how would we think about competing concerns in the environment or how best to respond to a baby's distress?"" See Also: Nurturing during preschool years boosts child s brain growth The study looked at the effect infant vocalizations in this case audio clips of a baby laughing or crying had on adults completing a cognitive conflict task. The researchers used the Stroop task, in which participants were asked to rapidly identify the color of a printed word while ignoring the meaning of the word itself. Brain activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG) during each trial of the cognitive task, which took place immediately after a two-second audio clip of an infant vocalization. The brain data revealed that the infant cries reduced attention to the task and triggered greater cognitive conflict processing than the infant laughs. Cognitive conflict processing is important because it controls attention one of the most basic executive functions needed to complete a task or make a decision, notes Haley, who runs UofT's Parent-Infant Research Lab. ""Parents are constantly making a variety of everyday decisions and have competing demands on their attention,"" says Joanna Dudek, a graduate student in Haley's Parent-Infant Research Lab and the lead author of the study. ""They may be in the middle of doing chores when the doorbell rings and their child starts to cry. How do they stay calm, cool and collected, and how do they know when to drop what they're doing and pick up the child?"" A baby's cry has been shown to cause aversion in adults, but it could also create an adaptive response by ""switching on"" the cognitive control parents use in effectively responding to their child's emotional needs while also addressing other demands in everyday life, adds Haley. ""If an infant's cry activates cognitive conflict in the brain, it could also be teaching parents how to focus their attention more selectively,"" he says. ""It's this cognitive flexibility that allows parents to rapidly switch between responding to their baby's distress and other competing demands in their lives--which, paradoxically, may mean ignoring the infant momentarily."" Learn More: Prenatal exposure to common household chemicals linked with substantial drop in child IQ The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that infants occupy a privileged status in our neurobiological programming, one deeply rooted in our evolutionary past.

The study, which is the first to examine the effects of infant vocalizations on adult neural activity during a cognitive task, is published in the journal PLoS ONE.

In a report on the research published in Cell, the scientists say they found a group of brain cells in charge of so-called sleep drive that becomes more active the longer flies are kept awake. The same mechanism, they say, also plays a role in putting the flies to sleep and keeping them that way. See Also: Sleep in a dish: Researchers isolate smallest unit of sleep to date The findings may offer insight into human sleep disorders and open up new strategies to promote long-lasting sleep for those with chronic insomnia who don't respond to available sleep drugs, they say. ""Although fruit flies look very different from people on the surface, they actually share many of the same genes and even behaviors,"" says Mark Wu, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""And with what we believe is the first identification a mechanism behind the adjustable nature of sleep drive, researchers can look for the same processes in mammals, including, one day, in humans."" In their search for sleep-regulating cells, Wu's team used genetic engineering to turn on small numbers of neurons in more than 500 fruit fly strains. They then measured how these flies slept when these neurons ""fired."" Several strains continued to sleep for several hours even after they turned off the neurons, stopping them from firing and suggesting that the researchers triggered sleep drive in these flies, which led to the persistent sleepiness. Using fluorescent microscopy, the scientists then examined the fly brains to specifically pinpoint the identity and location of the sleep drive-inducing cells. The firing neurons were genetically engineered to glow green. They were found in a structure called the ellipsoid body and are known as the R2 neurons. Don't Miss: Weekend catch-up sleep can reduce diabetes risk associated with sleep lossTo pin down more of what was going on, the researchers blocked the neurons from firing by genetically engineering the R2 neurons to make tetanus toxin, which silences the cells. The flies with the silenced R2 neurons slept on their normal schedule, but when the flies with the silenced R2 neurons were deprived of sleep during the night by mechanically shaking their vial houses, they got about 66 percent less ""rebound sleep"" compared to control flies, suggesting that they felt less sleepy after sleep deprivation. Next, the researchers tested how fly R2 neurons behaved on their own in awake, sleeping or sleep-deprived fruit flies. They used tiny electrodes to measure the firing of the R2 neurons in well-rested, awake fruit flies; in fruit flies that were an hour into their sleep cycle; and in fruit flies after 12 hours of sleep deprivation. In the well-rested fruit flies, the neurons fired only about once per second and were the least active. In the sleeping fruit flies, the neurons fired almost four times a second. In the sleep-deprived fruit flies, the neurons were the most active, firing at about seven times per second. ""These R2 neurons have higher firing rates the more sleep-deprived the fruit flies were and firing of these neurons puts flies to sleep, suggesting that we've identified the key cells responsible for sleep drive,"" says Wu. Wu says it's long been thought that getting to sleep requires an increase in sleep-promoting chemicals in specific parts of the brain as night and bedtime approach in the normal 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. However, he says, these chemicals last for only a few minutes at a time, so it has been puzzling how they can account for sleep drive that lasts hours. Learn More: Research shows hypnosis extends restorative slow-wave sleep As an answer to this question, Wu and colleagues used a genetic technique to light up the places on the surface of the R2 neurons where they actively release small chemical neurotransmitters, sending information to neighboring cells. Compared to well-rested flies, sleep-deprived flies had an increase in the number and size of the places releasing the neurotransmitter, and they appeared much brighter. Wu says these changes in number of neurotransmitter release sites account for how the neurons are able to adjust over time using a system for sleep drive that works over a period of hours, rather than minutes, like the known sleep-promoting chemicals. This flexible system can adjust to times when the flies are sleep-deprived or when they are just nearing their normal bedtime. He adds that the sleep drive process in the R2 neurons works similarly to how memories are encoded in other types of neurons, where changes in the neuron's information-sending and receiving parts adjust over time. ""Figuring out how sleep drive works should help us one day figure out how to treat people who have an overactive sleep drive that causes them to be sleepy all the time and resistant to current therapies,"" Wu says.

Humans ingest glyphosate residues mainly from foods including cereals (such as wheat, oats, barley, rye), which have been  desiccated  with glyphosate-based herbicide just prior to harvest and Roundup-tolerant genetically-modified (GMO) crops like sugar beets, corn, canola (rape), and soy. A study published in 2014 by the US Geological Survey found that across 38 US states there was glyphosate or its degradation product in most rivers, streams, ditches, and the output of water treatment plants sampled. Dr Michael Antoniou, based at a leading London University, is using Qlucore's Omics Explorer on a series of studies looking at the effects of ultra-low doses of glyphosate on gene expression profiles (transcriptomes), protein profiles (proteomes), and small molecule metabolite profiles (metabolomes) in rats and cell cultures. Dr Antoniou's research group employs cell and molecular analytical approaches to investigate transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that regulate gene expression including in response to various environmental stimuli, including environmentally relevant doses of key pesticides and other chemical pollutants. The group is particularly interested in epigenetic changes (changes that become stably inherited patterns of gene function from one cell division to another) in light of evidence that even brief exposure to some chemicals, especially those able to disrupt endocrine (hormone) systems during foetal development or early life, can have a lasting effect on gene control. ""Such a fixed change in gene expression pattern can lead to all kinds of problems later in life ranging from obesity, diabetes, a propensity to certain cancers and so on,"" explains Dr Antoniou. Powerful visualizations show clear results In the group's first study using the Qlucore software, post doctorate researcher Dr Robin Mesnage analyzed the transcriptomes of the livers and kidneys of ten rats treated with ultra-low, environmental doses of Roundup herbicide for two years and ten controls that hadn't. In an earlier study of the same animals, evidence of damage was found in the treated rats' urine, blood biochemistry and anatomy. The aim was to discover whether glyphosate had changed the transcriptomes and if so, what was the nature of these changes. Principal component analysis (PCA) visualization was the first step followed by heat map visualizations and statistical analysis. As Dr Antoniou explains: ""Rats have around 28,000 genes, only a subset of which will be switched on in the liver and in the kidney. Each gene is a dimension of analysis so you have 28k variables, which you need to reduce to something manageable. ""Using a PCA visualization, Qlucore allows you to graphically represent all these variables in just three dimensions, so that each animal occupies a particular location. Very quickly you can see how each animal relates to another and any treatment-related effect. If a number of animals are clustered together, you know that the effect is the same.  PCA charts can be output as video files and rotated in 3D. ""It is really powerful because sometimes by rotating the plot, you can see correlations that are not so clear in a flat 2D diagram,"" says Dr Antoniou. ""Heat map visualizations show the activity of each gene for each rat organ so you can see the variation in the group and whether it is homogenous.  says Dr Mesnage, who has been working on Roundup toxicity for eight years. In this transcriptome analysis, the heat map visualizations showed a clear separation of the control animals and those treated with Roundup, with massive alterations in the gene expression profile of the latter. Predictions based on molecular 'signatures' To gain further insight into these effects, Dr Antoniou and Dr Mesnage are hoping to use a new Omics Explorer feature called Build Classifier that can be used to make predictions based on molecular 'signatures'. ""If you see an alteration in a certain pattern of gene function, you can compare that pattern to another batch of genes to see if the signature matches. By taking those alterations and looking at them collectively, you could predict over time that a certain health problem will be the outcome,"" explains Dr Mesnage. If identifiable transcriptome, proteome and metabolome signatures can be found for a given dose of Roundup or other chemicals of interest, animal model studies could be completed much faster. Rats, for example, could be given low doses over a few months, rather than over two years making it possible to do larger numbers of shorter tests. ""Even though the exposure would be short, we are interested in whether we might still see an alteration in gene expression patterns in the blood, liver and kidney, even if the animal doesn t show any overt health problems,  explains Dr Mesnage. He adds:  If the changes are from epigenetic mechanisms of gene control, we know that the signatures can become fixed. On that basis, we could predict that kidney or liver function would be compromised in the long term."" A more wide-ranging project is using Omics Explorer to analyze possible endocrine disruptive effects in the transcriptome of tissue culture cell systems, such as human breast cancer cells, treated with low doses of a range of different pesticides. ""For example, if a chemical in food or water mimics the effect of oestrogen, that would be a concern for a woman with hormone dependent breast cancer,"" comments Dr Antoniou. Dr Antoniou and his team hope that their herbicide and pesticide studies and those of scientists in other sectors, particularly in the field of endocrinology, will encourage regulatory agencies to update the techniques they use to evaluate chemical toxicity.  We hope our work will further illustrate that regulators must embrace the latest principles of science that are showing potential toxicity at very low levels of exposure,  concludes Dr Antoniou.","Published: May 19, 2016"

If historical trends of land use changes to or from urban, agricultural or other uses continue, the result will be increased water-use demand beyond what existing supplies can provide. Large uncertainties associated with weather and climate variability have the potential to exacerbate the problem. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Nature Conservancy calculated historical trends of land-use change, urbanization, agriculture expansion and contraction from 1992 to 2012, and then used those trends to project future land-use patterns and water demand from 2012 to 2062 in California s Central Valley and foothills, Central Coast and South Coast. These new projections are detailed in the paper,  Future land-use related water demand in California  published this week in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Assuming no new storage, efficiency or technology is created to improve California s water supply, the study results indicate that the current 25 percent urban water-use restrictions called for in Governor Edmund G. Brown s Executive Orders B-29-15 and B-37-16 would need to be maintained through 2062 for future water demand to remain at or below 2012 demand, unless restrictions were put in place on other water uses. Water use in 2012 was already proven unsustainable given the ongoing multi-year drought, which led to mandated statewide urban-use restrictions in 2015. In the long term, drought, highly variable rainfall from year to year, and the real possibility of future warming and drying of climate combine to create potential water supply limitations. Coupled with population increases and shifting agricultural practices (from annual crops to orchards and vineyards) there can be enormous uncertainty in planning for future water supply and demand.  Modeling the future based on historical trends is not a prediction of what will happen, though patterns do emerge that can help guide water-use policies,  said Tamara Wilson, USGS research geographer and lead author of the study. In many ways, the recent drought is prologue to confronting the challenges that climate change presents for all of us. The reality is California s water demands outpace supply, and the precipitation this winter did not change that,  said co-author Dick Cameron, Associate Director for Science, Land Conservation Program at the Nature Conservancy in California.  Assuming a  business-as-usual  scenario of future land-use change, we show that the current pattern of increasing development and additional perennial cropland (orchards and vineyards) will lead to loss of grassland habitat and increased water use. Projecting land-use change data for California over the 50 years from 2012 to 2062 revealed the following potential changes:Large increase in urban area: 2 million acres of newly developed land cover over 50 years   a net increase of 40,000 acres a year   the equivalent of adding an area just larger than the city of Stockton each year.Large amount of grassland habitat loss of 1.1 million acres over 50 years, despite continued protection at the historical rate. This loss will also exacerbate challenges in preserving and recharging aquifers.An overall 4 percent increase in water supply demand (applied water) within the study area due to urbanization and expansion of orchards and vineyards.Large shifts from annual to perennial crops, which removes flexibility in irrigation demand during drought. While annual-crop water demand dropped 30 percent, perennial-crop demand increased 37.5 percent. Given the difference in area between these types, net agricultural water demand decreased nearly 8 percent over current demand.There will be a large shift toward developed-land water uses from the agriculture sector: Urban water use in 2062 is projected to increase to 27 percent of overall water use in the study area (from 18 percent in 2012).A net increase in overall projected water use in 38 of the 46 California counties in the study area by 2062.","Published: May 19, 2016"

Another intestinal disease is colon cancer, a leading cause of death, which is linked to diet and one s genetic predisposition to the disease. What is already known in the field of cell biology is that a transcription factor, called hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4-alpha), plays a key role in both diseases, transcription factors being proteins that help transcribe DNA into its close cousin, RNA, which is then translated into proteins which do the work of the cell. HNF4-alpha comes in two major isoforms, P1-HNF4-alpha and P2-HNF4-alpha (hereafter P1 and P2, respectively), but just how these isoforms are distributed in the gut and how each isoform plays a role in colitis and colon cancer are not understood. Now, working on mice, a team of researchers at the University of California, Riverside has determined the distribution of the P1 and P2 isoforms in the colon. They report in the journal eLife that maintaining a balance of P1 and P2 is crucial for reducing risk of contracting colon cancer and colitis.  P1 and P2 have been conserved between mice and humans for 70 million years,  said Frances M. Sladek, a professor of cell biology, who led the research project.  Both isoforms are important and we want to keep an appropriate balance between them in our gut by avoiding foods that would disrupt this balance and consuming foods that help preserve it.  What these foods are is our next focus in the lab.  The intestine is the only adult tissue in the body that expresses both P1 and P2. Sladek and her team have shown for the first time that these isoforms perform non-redundant functions in the intestine and are relevant to colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer.  Our study also suggests that finding a drug to stabilize one isoform should be more effective than targeting both isoforms for treating colitis and colon cancer,  said Karthikeyani Chellappa, the first author of the research paper and a former postdoctoral researcher in Sladek s lab. Sladek explained that the colonic epithelial surface has finger-like invaginations (into the colonic wall) called colonic crypts that house stem cells at their base. These stem cells help regenerate new epithelial cells that continuously migrate up towards the surface, thus ensuring complete renewal of the intestinal lining every three-five days. The researchers observed that the P1-positive cells were found in the surface lining and the top portion of the crypt (green in the accompanying image) while P2-positive cells were mostly in the proliferative compartment in the lower half of the crypt (proliferation marker is red in the image.)  Further, when transgenic mice   genetically engineered to have only either P1 or P2   were subjected to a carcinogen and, subsequently, to an irritant to stress the epithelial lining of the colon, the researchers found that the P1 mice showed fewer tumors than wildtype control mice.  When treated with irritant alone, these mice were resistant to colitis.  In sharp contrast, mice with only P2 showed more tumors and were much more susceptible to colitis. The researchers explain these findings by invoking the  barrier function    a mucosal barrier, generated by the colon s epithelial cells, that prevents bacteria in the gut from entering the body. In the case of P1 mice, this barrier function was enhanced.  The P2 mice, on the other hand, showed a compromised barrier function, presumably allowing bacteria to pass through. Next, the researchers examined genes expressed in the P1 and P2 mice. They found that RELM-beta, a cytokine (a signaling molecule of the immune system) expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and implicated in colitis, was expressed far more in the P2 mice than the P1 mice.  This makes sense since a reduced barrier function means bacteria can go across the barrier, which activates RELM-beta,  Sladek said.  We also found that the P2 protein transcribes RELM-beta more effectively than the P1 protein.  Next, Poonamjot Deol, an assistant project scientist in Sladek s lab and the second author of the eLife study, will lead a project aimed at understanding how diet affects the distribution of P1 and P2 in the gut.  She and others in the lab also plan to investigate how obesity and colitis may be linked.  (Diet studies performed in Sladek s lab in the past illustrated soybean oil s adverse effect on obesity.)  In the case of colitis, could soybean oil be playing a part in allowing bacteria to get across the barrier function?  Deol said.  We do not know.  We know its detrimental effect on obesity.  But more research needs to be done where colitis is concerned. ","Published: May 19, 2016"

The so-called thousand leaf filter is produced by researchers in nanotechnology at Uppsala University. It consists of cellulose nanofiber and has a unique layered internal structure similar to the French puff pastry mille-feuille (en. Thousand sheets). - With a commodity directly from nature and with simple production methods, we believe that our filter paper can be an affordable solution in water purification and help save lives. Our goal is to develop a filter paper which removes even the toughest viruses from water as easily as it brews coffee, says Albert Mihranyan, professor of nanotechnology at Uppsala University, who led the study. Access to clean drinking water is among the UN's sustainable development goals. Today lacks more than 748 million people access to clean water. Waterborne infections, including different viruses cause death, especially vulnerable are children under five. The virus can be both extremely resistant to disinfection and difficult to remove by filtration because they are so small. Today it is common to clean water with chemical disinfectants such as chlorine. Instead using filtration is a robust and energy efficient method to obtain drinking water, since it physically removes harmful microorganisms from the water instead of disabling them. - Clean drinking water is a problem not only in low-income countries. Major virus outbreaks have also occurred before in Europe, including Sweden, continues Albert Mihranyan. He was thinking in particular of the virus outbreak in 2008 in Lilla Edet, when more than 2400 people, or nearly 20% of the population was infected with Norovirus (Norwalk virus). Cellulose is one of the most common filter material used in everyday life for everything from tea bags to vacuum cleaners. But an ordinary filter paper is excessively large pores to remove viruses or bacteria. 2014 got Albert Mihranyans research team for the first time presented a paper filter that can filter out large viruses, such as influenza. Small viruses have been much harder to get rid of because they are extremely resistant to physical and chemical inactivation. A good filter will not only remove viruses, but also have high throughput, low pollution and long life. It makes advanced filters are very expensive to develop. Now, with the help of a thousand leaves the filter can be a breakthrough that could enable the long-awaited transition to less expensive filtering solutions. Another application of the filter includes the production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines. The research was conducted in collaboration with the German virologists, and it is an excellent teamwork is behind success, according to Albert Mihranyan.","Published: May 19, 2016"

The sponge extract, known as Dendrilla membranosa, yields a new, natural product chemical which has shown in laboratory tests that it can eliminate more than 98 percent of MRSA cells. The research team has named the new chemical  darwinolide.  The study describing their methods and results was published this week in the American Chemical Society s journal Organic Letters. While years ago the highly-resistant MRSA infection was particularly problematic in places such as hospitals and nursing homes, it has developed into an infection that can be found in commonly-used places such as gyms, locker rooms and schools.  In recent years, MRSA has become resistant to vancomycin and threatens to take away our most valuable treatment option against staph infections,  said study co-author and USF microbiologist Dr. Lindsey N. Shaw. MRSA is unique in that it can cause infections in almost every niche of the human host, from skin infections, to pneumonia, to endocarditis, a serious infection of tissues lining the heart. Unfortunately, the pace of the pharmaceutical industry s efforts to find new antibiotics to replace those no longer effective has slowed in recent years, said Shaw. Like many other bacterium, the MRSA bacteria forms a biofilm.  Biofilms, formed by many pathogenic bacteria during infection, are a collection of cells coated in a variety of carbohydrates, proteins and DNA,  said Shaw.  Up to 80 percent of all infections are caused by biofilms and are resistant to therapy. We desperately need new anti-biofilm agents to treat drug resistant bacterial infections like MRSA.  USF chemistry professor Dr. Bill Baker and colleagues have literally gone to the  ends of the Earth  to help in the fight against MRSA. Baker, who also serves as director of the USF Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation (CDDI), studies the chemical ecology of Antarctica and dives in the frigid waters near Palmer Station to retrieve marine invertebrates, such as sponges, to carry out  natural product isolation,  which means drawing out, modifying and testing natural substances that may have pharmaceutical potential. His group led the effort to extract and characterize chemical structures to create darwinolide from the freeze-dried Antarctic sponges and then test in Shaw s lab to determine its effectiveness against the MRSA bacteria.  When we screened darwinolide against MRSA we found that only 1.6 percent of the bacterium survived and grew. This suggests that darwinolide may be a good foundation for an urgently needed antibiotic effective against biofilms,  said Baker, whose research team  rearranged  the chemical composition of the extracted sponge. In the last 70 years, despite the discovery and use of antibiotics to treat infections, bacterial disease remains the second-leading cause of death globally, especially among children and the elderly, noted the researchers. In the U.S. alone there are two million hospital acquired infections annually with at least 100,000 deaths, many resulting from bacteria resistant to current antibiotics.  We suggest that darwinolide may present a highly suitable scaffold for the development of urgently needed, novel, anti-biofilm-specific antibiotics,  concluded the researchers.","Published: May 19, 2016"

Caribou's market-leading CRISPR-Cas9 technology accurately targets and cuts DNA to produce precise and controllable changes to the genome. This partnership further strengthens Genus' leadership in applying gene editing technology to improve animal health and well-being. It will provide Caribou with opportunities within the animal genetics space and offers a novel gateway to apply its technology to help improve the welfare of food-producing animals. The agreement gives Genus exclusive access to Caribou s CRISPR-Cas9 technology for the development of new traits in pigs, cattle and potentially other livestock species. In addition to an upfront payment, Caribou is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on licensed product sales from Genus. Additional terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Caribou and Genus will collaborate during a four-year research program, funded by Genus, which may be extended for an additional three years. Among the first targets of the program will be the further development and optimization of Genus  Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus ( PRRSv ) resistant pigs, the discovery of which was announced by Genus in December 2015. PRRSv is a devastating disease that can cause persistent infection in pigs and lead to reproductive failure, reduced growth, and premature death. There is currently no cure for the disease, which causes the suffering or death of millions of pigs and piglets each year. Gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows precise changes to be made in the genome of an animal without introducing genetic material from another organism. In the case of the PRRSv resistant pigs, a small change can be made to inactivate a single pig gene that produces a protein, known as CD163, which the PRRS virus requires for infection to occur. The gene editing technology used to create protection from PRRSv does not involve transplanting genes from one species to another. The strategic collaboration and license agreement will enable the acceleration of multiple research and development projects across Genus  bovine and porcine businesses. Additionally, Genus has invested $5 million in Caribou s recently completed Series B equity funding round. The decision to partner with, and invest in, Caribou reflects Genus  continued aim to be a global pioneer in animal genetic improvement to help nourish the world. Speaking about the collaboration with Caribou, Dr. Jonathan Lightner, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D of Genus, said:  This latest investment into genome editing ensures Genus will remain at the forefront of the development and application of technology to support the well-being of livestock. Caribou s CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform and its unique skills are significant to Genus as they provide the capabilities necessary to achieve the next stage of our PRRSv and other gene editing pipeline programs. This relationship will enable new and exciting research opportunities that will strengthen and accelerate Genus  gene editing capabilities. We look forward to working closely with the Caribou team.  Dr. Rachel Haurwitz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caribou said:  We are delighted to have entered into this collaboration with Genus, a leader in the animal genetics industry. We look forward to working collaboratively with Genus to apply our CRISPR-Cas9 technology platform to help improve animal health. We believe this partnership validates our leadership in the CRISPR-Cas technology field and exemplifies a key component of our strategy to work with world-class partners who are aligned with our vision to deploy the technology in responsible and ethical ways to solve important problems in healthcare, agriculture, and industrial biotechnology. Genus is clearly such a partner. ","Published: May 19, 2016"

The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction. Anacor s flagship asset, crisaborole, a differentiated non-steroidal topical PDE4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, is currently under review by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, commonly referred to as eczema.  We believe the acquisition of Anacor represents an attractive opportunity to address a significant unmet medical need for a large patient population with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, which currently has few safe topical treatments available,  said Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer s Global Innovative Pharma and Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare Businesses.  Crisaborole is a differentiated asset with compelling clinical data that, if approved, has the potential to be an important first-line treatment option for these patients and the physicians who treat them.   Anacor will be a strong fit with Pfizer s innovative business, further supporting our strategic focus on Inflammation and Immunology, and is expected to enhance near-term revenue growth for the innovative business. Our dedicated Inflammation and Immunology group has strong existing in-market franchises with Enbrel and Xeljanz, as well as a robust mid-stage pipeline, and this acquisition has the potential to add a near-term U.S. product launch. We believe we are well positioned to maximize crisaborole s commercial potential through our strong relationships with pediatricians and primary care physicians,  continued Bourla. In both of its Phase 3 pivotal studies, crisaborole achieved statistically significant results on all primary and secondary endpoints and in March 2016, the FDA accepted for review Anacor s New Drug Application seeking approval of crisaborole for the potential treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in children and adults. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for the completion of the FDA s review is January 7, 2017. If approved, Pfizer believes peak year sales for crisaborole have the potential to reach or exceed $2.0 billion.  Today marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Anacor, which we believe will deliver significant value to our shareholders,  said Paul L. Berns, Anacor s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  We have a deep respect for Pfizer, and it is clear that they share our commitment to addressing the significant unmet medical needs in inflammatory disease. We are proud of the innovative company that our team has built and are confident that Pfizer will help accelerate Anacor s important mission given the strength of its global platform and resources.  Atopic dermatitis is a common, relapsing, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder, with patients displaying a chronic rash characterized by inflammation and itching, often occurring in folds of the skin with symptoms lasting up to 14 days or more. Approximately 18 to 25 million people in the United States suffer from this condition, including between 8 and 18% of infants and children. Atopic dermatitis has been considerably under diagnosed due to the lack of approved effective systemic agents, and limitations of current topical agents. There have been no new molecular entities for atopic dermatitis in the last 15 years. Anacor also holds the rights to Kerydin, a topical treatment for onychomycosis (toenail fungus) that is distributed and commercialized by Sandoz Inc. in the U.S. Pfizer anticipates financing the transaction through existing cash. Pfizer does not expect the transaction to impact its current 2016 financial guidance. Pfizer expects the transaction to be slightly dilutive to Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)(1) in 2017 with accretion to Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) beginning in 2018 and increasing thereafter. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Anacor common stock for $99.25 per share in cash. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including U.S. antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Anacor common stock. The merger agreement contemplates that Pfizer will acquire any shares of Anacor that are not tendered into the offer through a second-step merger, which will be completed promptly following the closing of the tender offer. Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the third-quarter 2016. Pfizer s financial advisors for the transaction were Centerview Partners and Guggenheim Securities, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as its legal advisor. Citi served as Anacor s financial advisor, and Davis Polk & Wardwell, LLP served as its legal advisor.","Published: May 19, 2016"

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare disease of the brain's white matter caused by the John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), a usually harmless virus that infects up to 80 percent of healthy adults. See Also: Vaccination on the horizon for severe viral infection of the brain In the past, the virus usually only developed into brain disease in individuals with suppressed immune systems, such as AIDS patients and organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressant medications. Over the past decade, however, new drugs for a variety of autoimmune conditions have been identified as a key risk factor for the brain disease. The disease is now most common in multiple sclerosis patients who have the virus and who receive an immunosuppressant therapy called natalizumab. Patients with Crohn's disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia have also developed the devastating brain disease after immunosuppressant therapy with natalizumab and other drugs. ""Nobody comes away unscathed from PML you either die or you're left with a lifelong searing neurological defect,"" said Aron E. Lukacher, chair and professor of microbiology and immunology. ""Because we don't know how the drugs cause the JC virus to amplify from a silent infection, we really have no way of controlling it."" When other researchers studied the virus in patients with PML, they found a mutation in its protein shell, the part that allows it to bind to and infect human cells. In the new study, Lukacher's team sought to answer the question: Could this mutation affect how the immune system responds to the infection? To answer this, the researchers developed a new mouse model of polyomavirus infection that shares many characteristics that are seen in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. They learned that mice with mutated polyomavirus strains had a reduced T-cell response, the major part of the immune system that protects against the virus. Don't Miss: Some chronic viral infections could contribute to cognitive decline with aging ""We found that mouse polyomaviruses with a single amino acid change in their shell elicit a very different magnitude and quality of the T-cell response that is needed to control the infection,"" Lukacher said. The researchers also found that a signaling protein called type I interferon controlled the difference in T-cell response in mice with this mutant polyomavirus. Type I interferon directly controlled the ability of the virus to grow in mouse cells, the researchers said. It also controlled the size of the T-cell expansion and the function of these immune cells against the infection. Learn More: New viral tools to safely trace brain circuits developed These findings raise the possibility that viral shell mutations may influence the T-cell response to John Cunningham polyomavirus in humans, and play a role in the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Virology. It is still unknown how immunosuppressant therapies may cause these mutations in JCV, the researchers said. However, understanding the importance of the T-cell response could help researchers prevent the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in autoimmune patients.

Now researchers at the CanChild Centre for Childhood Disability Research at McMaster University have developed an autism classification system that defines levels of social communications ability among those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This new system will allow the child's care team to understand and work to improve the child's communication with others in everyday life. See Also: Interactions between cortical and subcortical regions important in hypersensitivity in ASD""This is not a test, but more like describing the colours of a rainbow,"" said Briano Di Rezze, a scientist with CanChild and the lead author for the paper published by the international journal Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology. ""Currently we hear terms like 'high-functioning' or 'low-functioning' to describe children with ASD. However there is no common interpretation of what those terms mean, which makes them unreliable because clinicians, therapists, and parents aren't using them in the same way,"" said Di Rezze, who is also an assistant professor of occupational therapy at McMaster's School of Rehabilitation Science. The new system, called the Autism Classification System of Functioning: Social Communication or ACSF:SC, provides a standardized and simplified way for clinicians, therapists, teachers, and parents to talk about a child's social communication abilities from the standpoint of what the child can do rather than what they cannot. The system was created through studies with parents and professionals who identified social communications as an important common element that could describe children with ASD. Led by CanChild, the tool was developed by a team of senior researchers and clinicians. Then parents and professionals across the country tested the tool. Related: Blood-based genetic biomarkers identify young boys with autism Simplified, the people using the assessment tool for preschool children use 'word pictures' that describe five levels of social communication, and determine a child's ability within two conditions: when they are performing at their best, known as their capacity, and what they usually do, known as their typical performance. The work was funded by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. CanChild researchers and their colleagues in Sweden and the US have created several functional classifications systems over the past 20 years. The first and best known of these classifications is the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for children with cerebral palsy, now used worldwide in more than 40 languages.

The research, led by Bernhard L scher, professor of biology and of biochemistry and molecular biology at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), will be published in the September 15, 2016, print edition of the journal Biological Psychiatry. Learn More:  Special K  could offer new hope for treatment-resistant depression ""Depression is the second most expensive health problem that we face worldwide, but this fact is not very well known because there is a stigma attached to depression and people don't like to talk about it,"" said L scher. ""About 17 percent of Americans will be treated for depression at some point in their lives, but there are limited treatment options and about one-third of patients do not respond to these treatments."" L scher and his colleagues generated a mouse model for depression by introducing a mutation into a gene that codes for one of the subunits of a receptor for GABA the second most abundant chemical used by nerve cells in the brain to communicate. GABA functions mainly to reduce the activity of nerve cells. The receptor mutation results in a reduction in GABA signaling of about 15 to 20 percent and mimics reductions in GABA signaling seen in patients with depression. The mice that have the mutation exhibit traits associated with depression, such as reduced pleasure seeking, and they become normal again following treatment with antidepressant medications. ""You can think of GABA as acting like the brakes of a car its function is to slow activity in nerve cells,"" said L scher. ""Its counterpart is glutamate, another signaling chemical in the brain that acts as the accelerator of nerve-cell activity. When we reduced the function of GABA in our mice, we were surprised to see that the level of glutamate was also reduced. This result suggests that the brain has mechanisms that maintain a balance between the brakes and the accelerator to prevent brain activity from going out of control, a state we refer to as homeostasis."" Learn More: Rapid agent restores pleasure-seeking ahead of other antidepressant action The researchers treated the mice with low doses of ketamine, an experimental antidepressant drug known to act by transiently blocking a major class of glutamate receptors in nerve cells. ""Treatment with ketamine not only normalized the behavior and brought glutamate receptor levels back up to normal in our mice, but GABA function also was restored,"" said L scher. Importantly, the effects of ketamine were only observed in mice with the receptor mutation where nerve signaling was defective, and not in normal mice. ""Our results bring together the hypothesis that depression results from deficits in GABA signaling and the hypothesis that depression results from deficits in glutamate signaling. We showed that the depression-like behavior in our mice results from the reduction of both GABA and glutamate, and importantly, that both can be restored with a single dose of ketamine."" The researchers plan to use their mouse model to better understand how ketamine functions to develop safer alternatives. ""Ketamine has many advantages over currently used antidepressant medications,"" said L scher. ""It acts quickly and has long lasting effects, but it is addictive and can induce psychosis, so we hope to use our model to better understand how ketamine works biochemically.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows a molecular pathway by which the brain communicates with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to prevent unnecessary activation of the immune system during fasting by strengthening the barrier against gut microbes. The discovery of this brain-gut signal in fruit flies, which has many parallels to humans, could eventually inform the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases in people. In addition to its role in promoting the absorption of nutrients from food, the GI tract is host to a panoply of bacteria. These microbes actually help in the digestive process by producing chemicals that break down complex fats and carbohydrates. See Also: New biological evidence reveals link between brain inflammation and major depression ""Fasting has a positive value that spills over not just into the metabolic system, but also inflammation and brain function,"" says the study's lead investigator Marc Montminy, professor in the Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology and holder of the J.W. Kieckhefer Foundation Chair. ""Understanding how the gut maintains this barrier, and creating drugs to enhance that barrier, may have important benefits for people with inflammatory bowel disease."" The new study is part of an ongoing collaborative effort by the Montminy lab and the lab of Salk Professor John Thomas to pin down the mechanisms that a genetic switch in the brain called Crtc uses to control energy balance. A constant network of communication--between our brains and the GI tract, as well as other tissues helps our bodies keep tabs on our energy expenditure and stores. Crtc interacts with another molecule called CREB, and fasting activates both proteins and boosts formation of long-term memories. The Montminy and Thomas teams used fruit flies to study the Crtc switch, in part because flies express many of the same metabolism-related genes as humans do. Previous experiments by the two labs have shown that flies whose Crtc gene is deleted become sensitized to fasting--they only survive about half as long without food compared to flies with the Crtc gene. The researchers were aiming to understand why the deletion of Crtc caused flies to die sooner and had hypothesized it was because these mutant flies have fewer fat and sugar stores. What the team--along with Salk Assistant Professor Janelle Ayres' group found in the new study, however, was surprising and more complicated. The guts of the flies without Crtc expressed several molecules indicating that their immune system was keyed up. When postdoctoral researcher Run Shen entered Montminy's lab with the evidence pictures taken from the microscope of fluorescently stained cells lining the flies' guts--""it was totally unexpected,"" he says. The new results suggest that the flies are more sensitive to starvation because the immune system is activated, which is energetically taxing. This amped-up immune response suggests that without Crtc, bacteria leak from the gut into the fly's circulation. The researchers found that the normal role of Crtc is to fortify the barriers of the gut to prevent bacteria from entering the bloodstream and awakening the immune system. Without Crtc, the connections between cells that line the gut tube become disrupted, causing bacteria to leak out, activating the immune response and depleting energy reserves. Learn More: Rapid response for inflammation control in songbirds' brains could lead to therapies in humans While looking for molecular partners of Crtc, the researchers uncovered a protein called short neuropeptide F (sNPF), which is also found in the brain and has an equivalent in humans (called neuropeptide Y). This peptide is known to cause flies and mammals to search for food in response to hunger signals. Without sNPF in the brain, the flies showed signs of gut inflammation similar to those flies missing Crtc. What's more, the normally tight seals along the gastrointestinal tract were broken down in the sNPF-lacking flies, letting bacteria out. Conversely, flies expressing more than the normal amounts of Crtc or sNPF in their neurons were able to survive longer without food and showed less disruption to the tight junctions that maintain their gastrointestinal barriers. The researchers are conducting more experiments to understand how the neuropeptides activate the gut receptors that help protect it from bacterial invasion.

As a consequence of the restraints, brain responses during many fundamental fly behaviors remain poorly understood.

Credit: Takeo Katsuki, Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind at UC San Diego  The UC San Diego team's solution features two technical innovations. First, the researchers created an imaging window on the fruit fly's head. They surgically removed the exoskeleton from the top of the head, which is about the size of a few grains of salt, and sealed the opening with transparent silicon adhesive. They then placed a small piece of coverslip on the head to create a flat surface suitable for imaging. This window provides a view of the protocerebrum, or the upper half of the fly brain. Second, they developed computer vision techniques to track a freely walking fly with unprecedented speed and precision. The system is built with rotating mirrors mounted directly above the walking arena that houses the fly and uses three cameras. As the fly walks, the mirrors, controlled by a low-magnification camera, rotate to bring the fly in view of a second, higher-speed, higher-magnification camera that further refines the mirror position so that the head of the fly is accurately positioned in the center of the view. A laser beam also targeted at the moving mirrors, and consequently the fly head, excites fluorescent genetic markers linked to specific neurons in the brain, and a third camera, a high-sensitivity one, records activity of those neurons. All of this takes place in real time at 1,000 frames per second. Don't Miss: Noninvasive imaging method looks deeper inside the body to study living brain Previous research has attempted to mimic a fly's freely moving behaviors. One approach, for example, features a fly treadmill, where a tethered fly walks on an air-suspended ball and is presented with various stimuli in a kind of virtual reality setup. But it has remained difficult to study, in restrained flies, the fundamental activities needed for survival or the sorts of complex social behaviors in which flies voluntarily interact with each other. Although the fly and mammalian brains are quite different anatomically, there is evidence for similarities in genetic programming and network connectivity, the researchers say. An advantage to studying the fruit fly brain is that it is relatively small, with about 100,000 neurons, yet sufficiently complex to display social and cognitive behaviors. Recent research has also suggested some emotional behaviors in flies. Another advantage to studying the fly brain is the availability of powerful genetic and molecular tools that can be used to manipulate and record neural activity at the level of the single cell.

The $280 million project adds two new buildings to the 89-acre Devens campus: a Biologics Development Building for designing processes for the early production of investigational medicines, and a Clinical Manufacturing Building where investigational medicines will be produced to support clinical trials. Both are new capabilities for Devens, a site that had previously focused solely on large-scale, bulk biologics manufacturing.  Biologics are increasingly important in the treatment of serious diseases and a rapidly growing part of our company s pipeline of potential new therapies,  said Lou Schmukler, president, Global Manufacturing & Supply.  Bringing together biologics development and clinical and commercial manufacturing on one campus will help accelerate the development of these innovative medicines for patients worldwide.  The expansion increases the site s workforce, with approximately 200 new jobs having been added at the project s initial completion rising to approximately 350 jobs over time. The two new buildings also add approximately 200,000 square feet to a site now comprised of eight major buildings in a 600,000 square-foot complex. Furthermore, the buildings add to the major investment the company has made at Devens, a former military base. When combined with the company s initial $750 million investment to build the facility, the expansion project brings the company s total investment at the site to more than $1 billion.  This project represents a significant expansion in the site s size and mission,  said Greg Guyer, senior vice president, Biologics Development and Operations.  It creates one of the world s premier integrated biologics facilities, a biologics center of excellence for the company, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and for patients.  The new buildings are also representative of a broader company initiative to incorporate more efficient design and workspaces that enable collaboration, creativity and innovation in all its facilities. Pedestrian bridges connect the different buildings at Devens, while interior design elements encourage interaction among the teams working in the closely linked scientific disciplines of biologics process development, clinical manufacturing and commercial manufacturing.  These dynamic new buildings, and our site as a whole, are designed to advance the important work that our employees are doing to develop and deliver innovative medicines for patients with serious diseases,  said Luis Maranga, the site s general manager. The buildings also continue our company s commitment to sustainability in its buildings and operations. The Biologics Development Building has received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED ) Silver certification for energy and environmental design, and the Clinical Manufacturing Building is also targeted for LEED Silver certification. Sustainable features in the new buildings include an abundance of natural light, a green roof, high efficiency lighting and water systems, water-efficient landscaping, and wood products from sustainable sources. The site s original lab and office building had previously received LEED Gold certification, while the manufacturing building received Silver.","Published: May 18, 2016"

Consequently, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and its partners have decided to advance the experimental HIV vaccine regimen into a large clinical trial. This new study, called HVTN 702, is designed to determine whether the regimen is safe, tolerable and effective at preventing HIV infection among South African adults. The trial is slated to begin in November 2016, pending regulatory approval.  For the first time in seven years, the scientific community is embarking on a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, the product of years of study and experimentation,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health and a co-funder of the trial.  A safe and effective HIV vaccine could help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic and is particularly needed in southern Africa, where HIV is more pervasive than anywhere else in the world.  The experimental vaccine regimen that will be studied in HVTN 702 is now being tested in the smaller initial trial, named HVTN 100, and is based on the regimen investigated in the U.S. Military HIV Research Program-led RV144 clinical trial in Thailand that delivered landmark results in 2009. The current regimen is designed to provide greater protection than the RV144 regimen and has been adapted to the HIV subtype that predominates in southern Africa. The experimental vaccine regimen tested in the RV144 trial was found to be 31.2 percent effective at preventing HIV infection during the 3.5 years after vaccination, although the regimen appears to have been 60 percent effective one year after vaccination. In the HVTN 702 study, the design and schedule of the RV144 vaccine regimen have been adjusted to try to increase the magnitude and duration of vaccine-elicited immune responses. NIAID is responsible for all operational aspects of the pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial, which will enroll 5,400 HIV-uninfected men and women ages 18 to 35 years who are at risk for HIV infection. The NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) will conduct the study. Results are expected in late 2020. The HVTN 702 study will be led by Protocol Chair Glenda Gray, MBBCH, FCPaed (SA). Dr. Gray is president and chief executive officer of the South African Medical Research Council, research professor of pediatrics at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and a director of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa.  HVTN 702 will tell us whether the initial success observed in HVTN 100 will bear fruit in the form of a safe and effective HIV vaccine designed for the people of southern Africa,  said Dr. Gray.  HVTN 100 and HVTN 702 are part of a larger HIV vaccine research endeavor led by a group called the Pox-Protein Public-Private Partnership, or P5   a diverse set of public and private organizations committed to building on the success of the RV144 trial. The P5 aims to produce an HIV vaccine that could have a significant public health benefit in southern Africa and to deepen scientists  understanding of the immune responses associated with preventing HIV infection. P5 members are NIAID, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the South African Medical Research Council, HVTN, Sanofi Pasteur, GSK and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program. The HVTN 702 vaccine regimen consists of two experimental vaccines: a canarypox-based vaccine called ALVAC-HIV and a bivalent gp120 protein subunit vaccine with an adjuvant that enhances the body s immune response to the vaccine. Both ALVAC-HIV (supplied by Sanofi Pasteur) and the protein vaccine (supplied by GSK) have been modified from RV144 to be specific to HIV subtype C, the predominant HIV subtype in southern Africa. In addition, the protein subunit vaccine in HVTN 702 is combined with MF59 (also supplied by GSK), a different adjuvant than the one used in RV144, in the hope of generating a more robust immune response. Finally, the HVTN 702 vaccine regimen will include booster shots at the one-year mark in an effort to prolong the early protective effect observed in RV144. All study participants will receive a total of five injections over one year. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine regimen or a placebo. The safety of HVTN 702 study participants will be closely monitored throughout the trial, and participants will receive the standard of care for preventing HIV infection. Study participants who become infected with HIV during the trial will be referred to local medical providers for care and treatment and will be counseled on how to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus.","Published: May 18, 2016"

The challenge in obtaining intact cell sheets, however, lies in releasing them from the substrate they are grown on in the culture dish quickly and without affecting their efficiency. Current methods to detach intact transplantable cell sheets from their growth surfaces in the culture dish require manipulations like a shift in temperature that can impact the efficiency of finicky cell types suitable for specific treatments and be prohibitively expensive for developing new applications. As reported in the May 18 issue of Scientific Reports, Joanna Aizenberg s team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at Harvard has developed a new method that can induce slipperiness on a growth supporting surface at will and sets the stage for the fast, efficient and inexpensive recovery of intact sheets of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with broad potential for regenerative medicine. Earlier work by Aizenberg was based on the observation that the Nepenthes pitcher plant, in times of rain, can reversibly render its surface slippery enabling it to trap insects. This ability in mind, Aizenberg s team pioneered Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces (SLIPS) as a general anti-fouling strategy. ""We leveraged these same basic principles that drove our previously conceived SLIPS, in which a thin oil layer formed on a polymeric matrix repels unwanted substances and organisms including ice, blood, bacteria or crude oil from a surface. In our new study, we use those principles as a 'creative', rather than 'preventive', strategy to generate a switchable surface in which we can induce slipperiness and release at will, at a time when an intact cell sheet with regenerative capacities has formed on the surface,"" said Aizenberg, Ph.D., who is a Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute, leader of the Wyss Adaptive Material Technologies platform, and also is the Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science at SEAS. As the method s linchpin, the team generated a thin layer of the commonly used, biocompatible polymeric material polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a cell culture dish that was infused with a chemically matched, non-toxic silicone oil to saturation. In addition, the infused polymer was coated with human fibronectin (FN), an extracellular matrix protein that MSCs and other cell types able to repair damaged tissues can adhere to and proliferate on in their natural tissue environments or in culture conditions. ""Once we have grown a near-confluent sheet of cells on top of the oil-infused, FN-coated polymer, we can carefully inject a small amount of oil underneath the cell layer. Because the polymer itself is already saturated, the oil can be freely moved around as a pool to detach the entire sheet including its adherent FN substrate in only about five minutes, much more rapidly than other methods would allow. Using a filter paper, we then are able to transfer the cell sheet to a new surface that in the future could be replaced by target tissues for in vivo regenerative approaches,"" said Nidhi Juthani, a Visiting Student working with Aizenberg and the first author on the study. Aizenberg s team, co-led by Wyss Technology Development Fellow Caitlin Howell (now Assistant Professor at the University of Maine), is working to further tailor and automate the procedure. Their goal is to facilitate the engineering of more differentiated cell sheet products such as muscle tissue or cartilage, and enable higher throughput generation and testing of multiple standardized cell sheets in parallel. ""Our technology is highly tunable: by changing the elasticity and geometry of the oil-infused polymer and adding in tissue-specific extracellular matrix proteins and differentiation factors that then become integral to the cell sheet, we may be able to tailor it to the engineering of diverse cell sheets suitable for various regenerative processes. This versatility, low cost and simplicity have not been possible with existing methods,"" said Aizenberg. ""Joanna s SLIPS technology is continuing to show its value in entirely unexpected ways. This is also an excellent example of how new advances in fundamental materials science can open new paths in biomedical research, and why we strive to promote collaboration across a broad range of disciplines here at the Wyss Institute,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology program at Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.","Published: May 18, 2016"

The findings may lead to the creation of a new source of life-saving blood-forming stem cells, which could help people with a wide range of blood diseases by reducing many of the risks of bone marrow transplants. Thousands of people each year in the U.S. alone are diagnosed with diseases that could be treated with the procedure. The study, led by senior author Dr. Hanna Mikkola and first co-authors Vincenzo Calvanese and Diana Dou, was published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. Blood-forming stem cells, or hematopoietic stem cells, are found in the bone marrow and can create any type of blood cell. The researchers pinpointed the function of a cluster of specialized genes that play a key role in creating and preserving hematopoietic stem cells and identified the process by which those genes are activated during human development and in the laboratory. For decades, doctors have used bone marrow transplants to treat people with diseases of the blood or immune system. One complicating factor has always been that certain proteins in the donor s and recipient s cells must match so that the donor s immune system doesn t reject the transplant. But finding a perfect match can be difficult, and the process is risky for both donors and recipients. The UCLA research could provide a way to create patient-specific hematopoietic stem cells, which would reduce some of the challenges associated with bone marrow transplants.  Our work focuses on finding a way to generate a supply of these life-saving hematopoietic stem cells in the lab so that they are a perfect match to the patient in need of a transplant,  said Mikkola, a professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology in the UCLA College and a member of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.  One big challenge is that when we try to create hematopoietic stem cells from pluripotent stem cells in the lab, they don t acquire the same abilities of the real hematopoietic stem cells found in the body.  Dr. Hanna Mikkola discusses her lab s goals of making blood stem cell therapies safer and more widely available. Pluripotent stem cells are capable of becoming any cell type in the human body. However, some tissue-specific stem cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells, have been difficult to derive from pluripotent stem cells, creating a fundamental challenge associated with the creation of stem cell-based medical treatments. Mikkola and the research team first tried to create hematopoietic stem cells in the lab from pluripotent stem cells. When they compared the lab-created cells to the hematopoietic stem cells found in the body, they found that an important cluster of genes, called HOXA genes, weren t activated in the lab-created cells. They also showed that HOXA genes help hematopoietic stem cells maintain their stem cell attributes, such as the ability to generate more copies of themselves, which is a defining characteristic of any kind of stem cell.  Without the ability to self-renew, hematopoietic stem cells cannot be used for transplantation therapies,  said Calvanese, an assistant project scientist in Mikkola s lab.  Our findings show that the activation of HOXA genes can be used as a marker for hematopoietic stem cells that have acquired the capacity to renew themselves.  The researchers  next challenge was to pinpoint the naturally occurring process that activates HOXA genes, so they could try to replicate the process in the lab. They found that mimicking the effects of retinoic acid, a compound derived from vitamin A, acts like a switch that turns on the HOXA genes during the development of hematopoietic stem cells.  Inducing retinoic acid activity at a very specific time in cell development makes our lab-created cells more similar to the real hematopoietic stem cells found in the body,  said Dou, a graduate student in Mikkola s lab.  This is an important step forward as we work to develop hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation therapies for life-threatening blood diseases.  The researchers  next step will be to refine the process they ve developed in order to produce lab-created hematopoietic stem cells that have   and maintain   all of the functions of human hematopoietic stem cells.

The disease usually manifests as genital tumours in both male and female domestic dogs. The cancer first arose approximately 11,000 years ago from the cells of one individual dog; remarkably, it survived beyond the death of this original dog by spreading to new dogs. The cancer is now found in dog populations worldwide, and is the oldest and most prolific cancer lineage known in nature. In a study published in the journal eLife, an international team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge studied the DNA of mitochondria   the  batteries  that provide cells with their energy   in 449 CTVT tumours from dogs in 39 countries across six continents. Previous research has shown that at occasional points in history, mitochondrial DNA has transferred from infected dogs to their tumours   and hence to tumour cells in subsequently-infected dogs. In the new study, the researchers show that this process of swapping mitochondrial DNA has occurred at least five times since the original cancer arose. This discovery has allowed them to create an evolutionary  family tree , showing how the tumours are related to each other. In addition, the unusual juxtaposition of different types of mitochondrial DNA within the same cell unexpectedly revealed that cancer cells can shuffle or  recombine  DNA from different mitochondria.  At five distinct time-points in its history, the cancer has  stolen  mitochondrial DNA from its host, perhaps to help the tumour survive,  explains Andrea Strakova, from the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, co-first author of the study.  This provides us with a set of unique genetic tags to trace how dogs have travelled the globe over the last few hundred years.  In the evolutionary  family tree , the five main branches are known as  clades , each representing a point in history when mitochondria transferred between dog and tumour. By mapping tumours within these clades to the geographical location where they were found, the researchers were able to see how the cancers have spread across the globe. The distance and speed with which the clades have spread suggests that the dogs commonly travelled with human companions, often by sea. One branch of the CTVT evolutionary tree appears to have spread from Russia or China around 1,000 years ago, but probably only came to the Americas within the last 500 years, suggesting that it was taken there by European colonialists. Conquistadors are known to have travelled with dogs   contemporary artworks have portrayed them both as attack dogs and as a source of food. The disease probably arrived in Australia around the turn of the twentieth century, most likely imported inadvertently by dogs accompanying European settlers. One of the most surprising findings from the study related to how mitochondrial DNA transfers   and mixes   between the tumour and the host. The researchers found that mitochondrial DNA molecules from host cells that have migrated into tumour cells occasionally fuse with the tumour s own  mitochondrial DNA, sharing host and tumour DNA in a process known as  recombination . This is the first time this process has been observed in cancers. M ire N  Leathlobhair, the study s co-first author, explains:  Mitochondrial DNA recombination could be happening on a much wider scale, including in human cancers, but it may usually be very difficult to detect. When recombination occurs in transmissible cancers, two potentially very different mitochondrial DNAs   one from the tumour, one from the host   are merging and so the result is more obvious. In human cancer, the tumour s mitochondrial DNA is likely to be very similar to the mitochondrial DNA in the patient s normal cells, so the result of recombination would be almost impossible to recognise.  Although the significance of mitochondrial DNA recombination in cancer is not yet known, its discovery is now leading scientists to explore how this process may help cancer cells to survive   and if blocking it may stop cancer cells from growing. Dr Elizabeth Murchison, senior author of the study, said:  The genetic changes in CTVT have allowed us to reconstruct the global journeys taken by this cancer over two thousand years. It is remarkable that this unusual and long-lived cancer can teach us so much about the history of dogs, and also about the genetic and evolutionary processes that underlie cancer more generally.  The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society.","Published: May 18, 2016"

Compared to other types of connective tissue is not easy to repair. The researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Milano-Bicocca have developed a bio-glass material that mimics the shock-absorbing and load bearing qualities of real cartilage. It can be formulated to exhibit different properties, and they are now hoping to use it to develop implants for replacing damaged cartilage discs between vertebrae. They believe it also has the potential to encourage cartilage cells to grow in knees, which has previously not been possible with conventional methods. The bio-glass consists of silica and a plastic or polymer called polycaprolactone. It displays cartilage-like properties including being flexible, strong, durable and resilient. It can be made in a biodegradable ink form, enabling the researchers to 3D print it into structures that encourage cartilage cells in the knee to form and grow   a process that they have demonstrated in test tubes. It also displays self-healing properties when it gets damaged, which could make it a more resilient and reliable implant, and easier to 3D print when it is in ink form. One formulation developed by the team could provide an alternative treatment for patients who have damaged their intervertebral discs. When cartilage degenerates in the spine it leaves patients with debilitating pain and current treatment involves fusing the vertebrae together. This reduces a patient s mobility. The scientists believe they will be able to engineer synthetic bio-glass cartilage disc implants, which would have the same mechanical properties as real cartilage, but which would not need the metal and plastic devices that are currently available. Another formulation could improve treatments for those with damaged cartilage in their knee, say the team. Surgeons can currently create scar-like tissue to repair damaged cartilage, but ultimately most patients have to have joint replacements, which reduces mobility. The team are aiming to  print  tiny, biodegradable scaffolds using their bio-glass ink. These bio-degradable scaffolds would provide a template that replicates the structure of real cartilage in the knee. When implanted, the combination of the structure, stiffness and chemistry of the bio-glass would encourage cartilage cells to grow through microscopic pores. The idea is that over time the scaffold would degrade safely in the body, leaving new cartilage in its place that has similar mechanical properties to the original cartilage. Professor Julian Jones, one of the developers of the bio-glass from the Department of Materials at Imperial, said:  Bio-glass has been around since the 1960 s, originally developed around the time of the Vietnam War to help heal bones of veterans, which were damaged in conflict. Our research shows that a new flexible version of this material could be used as cartilage-like material.  Patients will readily attest to loss of mobility that is associated with degraded cartilage and the lengths they will go to try and alleviate often excruciating pain. We still have a long way to go before this technology reaches patients, but we ve made some important steps in the right direction to move this technology towards the marketplace, which may ultimately provide relief to people around the world.  The researchers have received funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to take their technology to the next stage. They are aiming to conduct trials in the lab with the technology and develop a surgical method for inserting the implants. They will also work with a range of industrial partners to further develop the 3D manufacturing techniques. Professor Justin Cobb is the Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery at Imperial s Department of Medicine. He will be co-leading on the next stage of the research. Professor Cobb added:  This novel formulation and method of manufacture will allow Julian and his team to develop the next generation of biomaterials. The best performing artificial joints are more than a thousand times stiffer than normal cartilage. While they work very well, the promise of a novel class of bearing material that is close to nature and can be 3D printed is really exciting.  Using Julian's technology platform we may be able to restore flexibility and comfort to stiff joints and spines without using stiff metal and all its associated problems.  Professor Laura Cipolla, from the Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences at the University of Milano-Bicocca, added:  Based on our background on the chemical modification of bio- and nanostructured materials, proteins, and carbohydrates, we designed a new chemical approach in order to force the organic component polycaprolactone to stay together in a stable way with the inorganic component silica."" The team also includes PhD student Francesca Tallia from Imperial s Department of Materials and senior researcher Laura Russo, from the Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences at the University of Milano-Bicocca. The technology still has a number of regulatory hurdles to overcome before it reaches clinical applications for both applications. The team predict it will take ten years to for both technologies to reach the market. They have patented the technology with Imperial Innovations   the College s technology commercialisation partner.","Published: May 18, 2016"

We knew horseradish had health benefits, but in this study, we were able to link it to the activation of certain detoxifying enzymes for the first time,  says U of I crop scientist Mosbah Kushad. Kushad s research team had previously identified and quantified the compounds responsible for the cancer-fighting compounds, known as glucosinolates, in horseradish, noting that horseradish contains approximately 10 times more glucosinolates than its superfood cousin, broccoli.    No one is going to eat a pound of horseradish,  Kushad points out. Luckily, a teaspoon of the pungent condiment is sufficient to get the benefit. In the new study, Kushad and his team looked for the products of glucosinolate hydrolysis, which activate enzymes involved in detoxification of cancer-causing molecules. They compared the quantity and activity of these products in 11 horseradish strains rated U.S. Fancy, U.S. No. 1, or U.S. No. 2. The USDA puts fresh-market horseradish in these categories based on diameter and length of the root.  There was no information on whether the USDA grade of the horseradish root is associated with cancer preventive activity, so we wanted to test that,  Kushad explains. The group found that the higher-grade U.S. Fancy accessions had significantly more glucosinolates than U.S. No. 1. Concentrations of various glucosinolate hydrolysis products differed according to USDA grade, with U.S. Fancy having greater allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and U.S. No. 1 having greater 1-cyano 2,3-epithiopropane (CETP). The two compounds differ, with CETP being a comparatively weaker cancer-fighter than AITC. Still, the detection of CETP in horseradish is noteworthy, according to Kushad.  To our knowledge, this is the first detection and measurement of CETP from horseradish,  he says. The team suggests that AITC is a good dietary anti-carcinogen, not only because it activates the enzyme responsible for detoxifying cancer-causing molecules, but also because a large proportion of it, 90 percent, is absorbed when ingested. Bottom line? Next time horseradish is on the menu, pick up a spoon.","Published: May 18, 2016"

The technology could bring the option of an islet transplant to thousands more patients with type I diabetes. Currently in the UK, only 30-50 patients with hypoglycaemic unawareness can receive an islet transplant each year due to the low availability of suitable donor organs and the difficulty involved in extracting the islets. Islexa technology works by reprogramming donated pancreatic tissue into fully functional islets which will significantly increase the number of patients who can receive the treatment.   An islet transplant can give patients effective, long term glucose control without the need of insulin administration.  Keith Thompson, CEO of the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult and an Islexa director said:   This is a really exciting technology that has the potential to bring life changing benefits to these diabetic patients. We are delighted to be forming Islexa with the partners we ve worked with so far on this project. The collaboration has already delivered promising results and the formation of Islexa will accelerate the development of these lab grown islets and ultimately get this potential treatment to thousands of patients.  Professor Kevin Docherty, University of Aberdeen said:  The technology is based on converting pancreatic tissue into functional islets. This has an advantage over the use of stem cells as source material, since at the moment they generate only the insulin-producing beta cells. Islets are organoids that produce multiple hormones, including insulin, and donated islets are already effectively treating severe cases of type 1 diabetes. Having a hugely expanded supply of lab grown islets will enable us to significantly extend this established clinical treatment.    The creation of Islexa follows successful results in pre-clinical studies on the technology and the company will hold future IP rights of the islet technology. The company will initially continue to focus on further pre-clinical development of the protocol for reprogramming the pancreas tissue into functional islets. The next stage is to take the technology into clinical trials in the next few years.  The expansion and reprogramming technology has been developed at the University of Aberdeen as part of activities led by a consortium with the support of the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult. The consortium partners include University of Aberdeen, the Scottish Islet Transplant Programme, University of Edinburgh, and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS). The consortium partners bring unique expertise in clinical practice and manufacture, and will continue to work closely with Islexa during the development programme. Mr John Casey, Consultant Transplant Surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, and Lead Clinician for the Islet Transplantation Programme in Scotland said:   Islet transplantation can transform the lives of patients with type I diabetes, and in some cases can result in long term freedom from insulin injections with excellent glucose control. This exciting collaboration between the Scottish Islet Programme, Aberdeen University and the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult will allow us to rapidly develop the technology and treat more patients, more effectively.

ProBioGen s CSO, Dr. Volker Sandig, comments:  Deviating from the typical GlymaxX  application of enhancing the cell-killing potency of CHO-derived therapeutic antibodies in cancer, GlymaxX  plays out its universal applicability in a radically different field. In this case, GlymaxX  acts to prevent the formation of cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants on recombinant proteins, expressed in insect cells, which would otherwise cause the detection of IgE antibodies of a certain kind with no clinical significance. Thus, this sophisticated technology serves to add to the specificity of the diagnostics test result.  Dr. Jon-Sverre Schanche, VP R&D for Thermo Fisher s ImmunoDiagnostics business explains:  Our ImmunoCAP blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies aid clinicians worldwide in their diagnoses of patients with allergy-like symptoms. The GlymaxX  technology will help us in our effort to develop diagnostic tests that deliver even greater clinical precision for the benefit of doctors and allergic patients worldwide.  ProBioGen s CEO, Dr. Wieland Wolf, added:  We are very pleased that GlymaxX , besides its successful therapeutic application, is now employed for diagnostics as well.

It travels along the urethra to the bladder where it triggers painful infections. In order to infect the bladder (which is constantly being flushed out with urine), the bacteria have developed nanofilaments which effectively anchor the bacteria to the walls of the urinary tract. A team headed by Professor Trevor Lithgow, from the Biomedicine Discovery Institute at Monash University, has found a protein   called the TAM   that is crucial to the assembly of these anchoring filaments. In a paper, published today in Nature Microbiology, the researchers describe how they developed an assay to measure the assembly of the filament forming protein, called usher.  Using our assay we tested whether blocking TAM had any effect on usher. What we found was that TAM is required for the assembly of usher and therefore for production of the filaments needed to anchor the bacteria to the urinary tract surface,  he said. The assay revealed that, under normal circumstances, E. coli can create filaments within two minutes of sensing the urinary tract environment. However, when TAM is blocked, it can take up to four hours for the same anchoring process to happen. According to Professor Lithgow, the discovery of how TAM impacts on the E. coli s ability to latch onto the wall of the urinary tract could be a very important target for drug therapy.  Most antibiotics against E. coli have to get across the bacterial cell membranes in order to kill the invader,  he said.  The TAM is on the bacterial surface, so it is directly accessible to the sorts of drugs that would inhibit its function, and thereby halt the rapid production of these nanofilaments.  Importantly, other potentially lethal bacteria also use filaments which are controlled through TAM, according to Professor Lithgow. These include Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria (KPC), which caused a scare in Victoria last year when Victorian authorities issued an alert that the antibiotic resistant superbug may have contributed to up to 18 deaths over the previous three years.","Published: May 18, 2016"

On the warmest of these days, the air arrives from the south, bringing with it high temperatures, moisture and natural forest emissions of chemicals, known as hydrocarbons, from the Ozark Plateau. The hydrocarbons can interact with human-influenced emissions, and in the presence of sunlight, create a cocktail of pollutants   including ozone   that are hazardous to human health. A team of engineers in the School of Engineering & Applied Science at Washington University in St. Louis collaborated with researchers at the University of Minnesota to study the late-summer air quality in the St. Louis area and found that the way that isoprene, a natural hydrocarbon compound emitted from broadleaf deciduous trees, such as oak, is processed in the atmosphere at night can have a big impact on the ozone in the atmosphere the next day. Brent Williams, the Raymond R. Tucker Distinguished I-CARES Career Development Assistant Professor, and Jay Turner, associate professor of energy, environmental & chemical engineering, both at WashU; and Dylan Millet, associate professor in the Department of Soil, Water, and Climate at the University of Minnesota, and other members of their research teams discovered the phenomenon after studying data from the St. Louis Air Quality Regional Study (SLAQRS), which took place in 2013 at the St. Louis-Midwest Supersite core monitoring station in East St. Louis, Ill. Results of the study were recently published online in Environmental Science & Technology and are the first to show this phenomenon. ""Here we are looking at ground-level ozone, which is different than the ozone high up in the stratosphere that protects us from UV radiation,"" Williams said. ""What often isn't talked about is that we do need a little ozone here on the ground as well to kick start chemical reactions that clear pollutants out of the atmosphere. However, too much ozone will damage materials and even your lungs. That's why the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set limits for ozone concentrations in the atmosphere, which can't exceed 70 parts per billion averaged over an eight-hour period."" The EPA considers April 1-Oct. 31 ""ozone season"" for the St. Louis region, when ozone pollution is more of a problem because of the sunlight and heat. Ozone forms from the combination of nitrogen oxides emitted from combustion sources such as vehicles or power plants, hydrocarbons from natural or human-influenced sources and sunlight. Ozone concentrations generally peak when temperatures are highest during the afternoon hours. Trees in forests emit isoprene, an organic hydrocarbon tied to photosynthesis strongly dependent on light and temperature and emitted during the daylight hours. St. Louis is downwind of the deciduous forests of the Ozark Plateau, a major isoprene source region nicknamed the ""isoprene volcano,"" because it has the largest emission rates of isoprene in the U.S., Williams said. Turner and collaborators previously conducted a field study that examined the isoprene emissions from the isoprene volcano. During the SLAQRS study, southerly winds brought to St. Louis emissions from the Ozark region, however, isoprene had largely underwent chemical reactions and had faded away prior to arriving in St. Louis during the daylight hours. Isoprene that was emitted at the end of the day did not react away and was transported into St. Louis overnight. The team found that if human-influenced emissions of nitrogen oxides were in low abundance in the air at night, isoprene remained in the atmosphere until daybreak, when it reacted with the sunlight and created a burst of ozone production, in stark contrast to the typical peak of ozone levels in mid-late afternoon and extending the daily high-ozone period. That pushed the ozone measurement over 70 parts per billion for a short period, increasing the potential for ozone standard exceedances, Williams said. However, on nights when nitrogen oxides were in large abundance in the atmosphere, they reacted with ozone left over from the daytime and created nitrate radicals. When the sun rose the next morning, those nitrate radicals had reacted with the isoprene overnight to eliminate it   and ozone   from the atmosphere. In this case, the presence of nighttime nitrogen oxides prevents excess ozone formation the next morning, whereas daytime nitrogen oxides still produce ozone. The phenomenon likely applies to other cities downwind of forests. Nitrogen oxides still contribute to daytime ozone formation and should be controlled to limit ozone formation, but regulatory agencies should be aware of this nighttime chemistry that influences morning ozone levels, Williams says. ""We have to control what we can to prevent detrimental health impacts,"" Williams says. ""With the three key ingredients to ozone production, we can control nitrogen oxides and some of the hydrocarbons from combustion sources, but we can't do anything about the hydrocarbons that  forest is emitting, nor should we attempt to change the amount of sunlight. An understanding of this chemistry will help to predict elevated morning ozone periods and could even be factored into air quality alerts and awareness efforts.""","Published: May 18, 2016"

Anchor Scott Pelley again led the reporting of the program, which spanned more than two years. It provides major updates to the news magazine s initial two-part segment,  Killing Cancer,  which aired March 29, 2015. Sunday night s segment revisited the work of Dr. Matthias Gromeier and featured interviews with neuro-oncologists Dr. Annick Desjardins and Dr. Henry Friedman, along with and brain tumor center director Dr. Darell Bigner, who are among many on Duke's poliovirus team.  The program also resumed where it left off in the journey of Nancy Justice and her family, who came to the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center in October 2014 to receive the poliovirus therapy after undergoing unsuccessful treatment elsewhere for glioblastoma. Sacrifice, commitment and, most of all, hope inspired Nancy and her husband, Greg, through the months that followed the treatment. After initially responding well and getting great reports during her clinical visits with Dr. Desjardins, who led her care, Nancy took a turn for the worse. She passed away on April 6, 2016   almost 18 months after receiving the poliovirus therapy at Duke. The program noted that the months that Nancy survived beyond the typical lifespan for people with glioblastoma were not without challenge, but also full of discovery and joy and gratitude. For the team at the brain tumor center, Nancy s death was devastating. But there have been many causes for hope. The first poliovirus patient, Stephanie Lipscomb, received the treatment in 2012 and has now graduated from college and is working as an oncology nurse. Another patient and young father, Brendan Steele, was featured in the program as a three-year survivor after receiving the treatment in 2013. All of the patients' experiences have offered tremendous insights into the poliovirus therapy and its potential. As CBS reported, the Duke team, led Bigner, was awarded  breakthrough therapy designation  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration just last week, which will expedite the development and review of the poliovirus approach. To receive a designation of breakthrough therapy, preliminary evidence must indicate that the treatment shows substantial improvement over available therapy.   Breakthrough status means that we can work with the highest levels in the FDA to develop the most efficient clinical trial and pathway to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of the genetically modified poliovirus for treating recurrent glioblastoma,  Bigner said.  Ultimately, we hope the therapy will one day obtain FDA approval.  Additionally, the 60 Minutes segment reported that the Duke team is moving to open a clinical trial for children with brain tumors, which is planned to begin before the end of the year. It has also received grants to expand the research to explore the therapy s effect on solid tumors. Laboratory studies are already underway in breast cancer models in work led by Duke's Smita Nair.","Published: May 18, 2016"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-did-the-giraffe-get-its-long-neck-197208,How Did The Giraffe Get Its Long Neck  Clues about the evolution of the giraffe s long neck have now been revealed by new genome sequencing  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.For the first time, the genomes of the giraffe and its closest living relative, the reclusive okapi of the African rainforest, have been sequenced -- revealing the first clues about the genetic changes that led to the evolution of the giraffe s exceptionally long neck and its record-holding ranking as the world s tallest land species. The research will be published in the scientific journal Nature Communications on May 17, 2016.  The giraffe s stature, dominated by its long neck and legs and an overall height that can reach 19 feet (~ 6 m), is an extraordinary feat of evolution that has inspired awe and wonder for at least 8,000 years -- as far back as the famous rock carvings at Dabous in the Republic of Niger,  said Douglas Cavener of Penn State, who led the research team with Morris Agaba of the Nelson Mandela African Institute for Science and Technology in Tanzania.  The evolutionary changes required to build the giraffe s imposing structure and to equip it with the necessary modifications for its high-speed sprinting and powerful cardiovascular functions have remained a source of scientific mystery since the 1800s, when Charles Darwin first puzzled over the giraffe s evolutionary origins,  said Cavener, a professor of biology and the Verne M. Willaman Dean of the Eberly College of Science at Penn State. The giraffe s heart, for example, must pump blood two meters straight up in order to provide an ample blood supply to its brain. This feat is possible because the giraffe's heart has evolved to have an unusually large left ventricle, and the species also has blood pressure that is twice as high as other mammals. To identify genetic changes likely to be responsible for the giraffe's unique characteristics, including sprints that can reach 37 miles per hour (60 km/h), Cavener and Agaba compared the gene-coding sequences of the giraffe and the okapi to more than forty other mammals including the cow, sheep, goat, camel, and human. ""Okapi s gene sequences are very similar to the giraffe s because the okapi and giraffe diverged from a common ancestor only 11-to-12 million years ago   relatively recently on an evolution timescale,"" Cavener said. ""In spite of this close evolutionary relationship, the okapi looks more like a zebra and it lacks the giraffe s imposing height and impressive cardiovascular capabilities. For these two reasons, Okapi's genome sequence provides a powerful screen that we have used to identify some of the giraffe's unique genetic changes."" Using a battery of comparative tests to study the genome sequences of the giraffe and the okapi, the scientists discovered 70 genes that showed multiple signs of adaptations. ""These adaptations include unique amino-acid-sequence substitutions that are predicted to alter protein function, protein-sequence divergence, and positive natural selection,"" Cavener said. Over half of the 70 genes code for proteins that are known to regulate development and physiology of the skeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous system   just the type of genes predicted to be necessary for driving the development of the giraffe s unique characteristics. Among the research team's discoveries are that several genes known to either to regulate the development of the cardiovascular system or to control blood pressure are among the genes showing multiple signs of adaptation in the giraffe. Some of these genes control both cardiovascular development and skeletal development, suggesting the intriguing possibility that the giraffe's stature and turbocharged cardiovascular system evolved in concert through changes in a small number of genes. The scientists also discovered genetic clues to the evolution of the giraffe's long neck and legs, which have the same number of bones as the neck and legs of humans and other mammals. ""To achieve their extraordinary length, giraffe cervical vertebrae and leg bones have evolved to be greatly extended,"" Cavener said. ""At least two genes are required   one gene to specify the region of the skeleton to grow more and another gene to stimulate increased growth."" Among the 70 genes that the team's research revealed are markedly different in the giraffe, the scientists identified genes that are known to regulate both of these functions. ""The most intriguing of these genes is FGFRL1, which has a cluster of amino acid substitutions unique to giraffe that are located in the part of the protein that binds fibroblast growth factors -- a family of regulators involved in regulating many processes including embryo development,"" Cavener said. This fibroblast-growth-factor pathway plays a crucial role in controlling development, beginning in early development of the embryo and extending through the bone-growth phase after the giraffe is born. In humans and also in mice, severe skeletal and cardiovascular defects are associated with debilitating mutations in this gene. The scientists also identified four homeobox genes -- the kind involved in the development of body structures -- which are known to specify the regions of the spine and legs. Cavener speculates, ""The combination of changes in these homeobox genes and the FGFRL1 gene might provide two of the required ingredients for the evolution of the giraffe's long neck and legs."" Agaba first noticed a group of genes regulating metabolism and growth that were diverged in giraffe as compared to okapi. One of these genes encodes the receptor for folic acid, which is an essential B vitamin necessary for normal growth and development. Other metabolic genes that the scientists found to be significantly changed in giraffe are those involved in the metabolism of the volatile fatty acids that are generated by the fermentation of ingested plants -- the major source of energy for the giraffe and other ruminants like cattle and goats. The giraffe has an unusual diet of acacia leaves and seedpods, which are highly nutritious but also are toxic to other animals. The scientists speculate that the genes responsible for metabolizing acacia leaves may have evolved in the giraffe in order to circumvent this toxicity. Cavener and Agaba, both experimental geneticists, say they are anxious to test the function of some of the identified genes that they believe may be responsible for the giraffe s unique characteristics. Their research team currently is testing the potential effect of the unique differences of the giraffe's FGFRL1 gene by introducing these changes into mice using the new CRISPR gene-editing methods. Substituting the giraffe's FGFRL1 gene into mouse is not expected to make a long-necked mouse. However, the scientists are hoping to see how the giraffe's FGFRL1 gene may affect differential growth of the spine and legs of the mice that is predictive of the giraffe's unique features. ""We hope that the publication of the giraffe genome and clues to its unique biology will draw attention to this species in light of the recent precipitous decline in giraffe populations,"" Cavener said. ""While the plight of the elephant -- giraffe s shorter companion in the African savannah -- has received the lions share of attention, giraffe populations have declined by 40 percent over the past 15 years due to poaching and habitat loss (http://www.giraffeconservation.org). At this rate of decline, the number of giraffes in the wild will fall below 10,000 by the end of this century. Some giraffe subspecies already are teetering on the edge of extinction."" In addition to Agaba and Cavener, other members of the research team include Edson Ishengoma of the Nelson Mandela African Institute for Science and Technology; Webb C. Miller, Barbara C. McGrath, Chelsea Hudson, Oscar C. Bedoya Reina, Aakrosh Ratan, Rico Burhans, Rayan Chikhi, Paul Medvedev, Craig A.

Another important aspect of the alliance will focus on validating next-generation gene transfer technology using adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery vectors. The collaboration will also explore the expanded use of genome editing technology -- the insertion, deletion or replacement of DNA in the genome of an organism -- as a potential therapeutic platform. This collaboration with Penn reinforces Biogen s commitment to gene therapy and rare diseases. Biogen aims to build a robust gene transfer and gene editing platform for the future treatment of inherited or acquired diseases. Biogen will work with James Wilson, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics, and Director of Penn s Gene Therapy Program, and Jean Bennett, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology and Cell and Developmental Biology and Director of the Center for Advanced Retinal and Ocular Therapeutics. Both are recognized leaders in gene therapy in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  We are committed to advancing gene therapy, and our collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania has significantly strengthened both our leadership and overall capabilities in the field,  said Olivier Danos, Ph.D., senior vice president, Cell & Gene Therapy at Biogen.  Joining forces with gene therapy pioneers, James Wilson and Jean Bennett, further enables Biogen to approach the technology from a powerful perspective. By exploring next-generation delivery in various tissues such as the retina, skeletal muscle and CNS, we will explore the potential for extending gene therapy beyond disorders linked to single gene mutations and into a broader spectrum of complex diseases, including devastating neurological conditions that affect a multitude of patients throughout the world.   My laboratory is committed to developing new technologies to address genetic diseases with few or no treatment options,  said Dr. Wilson, who is also the Director of the Orphan Disease Center at Penn.  This alliance is further evidence of Penn s unflagging commitment towards enabling groundbreaking research and development in the cell and gene therapy field.

These microbial communities bacteria, viruses and fungi affect every ecosystem on earth, including human bodies, oceans, homes and the surrounding land. The new center dovetails with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy s National Microbiome Initiative, launched May 13 with the goal of bringing together public and private entities to advance the understanding of microbiome behavior and enable protection and restoration of healthy microbiome function.  In the past few years we ve seen a state change in understanding the roles bacteria play in our world,  said Jack Gilbert, who will serve as the center s faculty director. Gilbert, a professor in UChicago's Department of Surgery, has research affiliations at both Argonne and MBL.  This is a unique opportunity to take that knowledge and help drive the next generation of microbiome research forward.  The Microbiome Center aims to support the research community across the three institutions, building on a long tradition of research excellence and collaboration. It also will enable rapid translation to private and clinical sectors, and train a new generation of scientists to take on fundamental questions about the microbiome, Gilbert said.  The University of Chicago, MBL and Argonne already have conducted some of the most influential research aimed at understanding and characterizing microorganisms,  said Argonne Director Peter B. Littlewood.  We want to capitalize on this history and expertise in order to advance our capabilities and explore problems that are critical for modern society.  Marine Biological Laboratory President and Director Huntington Willard said,  This will let us run faster, jump higher, think bigger and tackle the most important questions facing the field, particularly as they impact life in our oceans.  In the past decade, new techniques many pioneered at the participating institutions have allowed researchers to peek at the hidden communities of microbes that populate our world by the trillions. These studies revealed that microorganisms have complex relationships that affect plants, crops and buildings, and are major players in moving carbon and other elements through massive global cycles. Microorganisms also live on and in animals and humans, where they both cause and prevent disease and also regulate some of our most essential functions.  A greater understanding of microbial communities could affect everything from medicine to agriculture to marine systems and urban development,  Gilbert said. Microbiome research pulls from many disciplines, including microbiology, immunology, genomics, ecology and evolution, surgery, computation, and bioengineering; each institution brings its own expertise to the mix. Argonne has deep expertise in environmental microbiology and sequencing techniques. The Marine Biological Laboratory has extensively studied microbial populations living in oceans, in coastal waterways and in organisms ranging from marine animals to humans. The University of Chicago is a leader in ecological research, and The University of Chicago Medicine has increased its focus on human microbiology and its relation to human health. Eugene Chang, a professor of biomedical sciences at UChicago who sits on the steering committee for the new center, highlighted the importance of collaboration to facilitate his research into the role of the microbiome in human health problems, such as obesity and metabolism.  It really wouldn t have been possible to answer any of these questions from a single laboratory,  he said.  You could see how each of us look at the same question and each take a different approach. You really needed this multidisciplinary expertise to make discoveries about fundamental principles,  said Chang.  It s really a human need,  said Cathy Pfister, another steering committee member who is a professor in ecology and evolution studying ocean microbes.  We re talking about how ecosystems will manage changes caused by humans and that will help us understand how we can continue to reap the benefits of the oceans, such as seafood, oxygen and water filtering.   The new center will broaden the look we have at the microbiome,  Willard said.  By asking the same questions on different settings and scales, my guess is that we will discover similar principles at work from people studying inner-city microbes and those in deep oceans and that s where we can say something fundamental about how life works.

The projects will examine the use of genomic information in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases; genomic information privacy; communication about prenatal and newborn genomic testing results; and the impact of genomics in American Indian and Alaskan Native communities.  Many ethical and social problems are not solved by experts in a single discipline alone,  said Joy Boyer, senior program analyst in NHGRI s Ethical, Legal and Social Implications Research Program.  The CEER program brings together experts from often disparate fields who speak different languages and forms centers where they can study issues across disciplines. These grants are diverse and forward-looking, while also relevant to public health and medicine today.  The CEER program, established in 2004, is designed to bring together experts in wide-ranging fields   bioethics, law, behavioral and social sciences, epidemiology, public health, public policy, genomics and clinical research   to study the potential societal implications of genomic information and research. CEER projects also help inform public policy and research guidelines, in addition to educating the next generation of researchers. Each center is built so researchers can look to the future within specific focus areas.  They enable researchers to anticipate new questions and issues that will arise in their particular field of study, and understand how to address them,  said Lawrence Brody, Ph.D., director of the NHGRI Division of Genomics and Society.  The centers examine the human side of research advances, and tackle subjects at the interface of ever-changing technology and medicine.  The grants, totaling approximately $15 million over four years (pending available funds), will support the following research projects: Ethical, Legal and Social Issues for Precision Medicine and Infectious Disease Gail Geller, Sc.D., Jeffrey Kahn, Ph.D., and colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore will use $4,155,172 over four years to examine the ethical implications of using genomic information to help manage the prevention, control and treatment of infectious diseases. The researchers will develop and conduct three pilot projects that study how genomic information affects infectious disease research, public health policy and clinical practice. The work builds on previous NHGRI-supported research. Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings Researchers at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, will study privacy risks associated with genomic information. Ellen Wright Clayton, M.D., J.D., and Bradley Malin, Ph.D., will use $4,012,641 over four years to examine factors that influence how people perceive such risks. The researchers will examine the effectiveness of legal and policy efforts to reduce privacy risks, and study the likelihood that lapses in protecting genomic information allow people to be identified. They will develop policies to prevent the loss of privacy that could lead to the use of personal genomic information for unintended purposes, such as to discriminate in decisions about employment and insurance. Utah Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal and Social Implications Research Jeffrey Botkin, M.D., M.P.H., and his colleagues at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City are expanding on research on prenatal testing already supported by NHGRI. A grant for $3,881,732 over four years will enable the researchers to study how family members communicate about prenatal and newborn screening, including how test results and risks are communicated, decision-making and couples communication. Center on American Indian and Alaska Native Genomic Research At the University of Oklahoma in Norman, researchers Paul Spicer, Ph.D., Amanda Cobb-Greetham, Ph.D., Cecil Lewis, Ph.D., and their colleagues will examine how the use of genomic information in medical care could potentially impact American Indian and Alaska Native communities and health care systems. A grant for $3,611,308 over four years will allow the university to partner with the Chickasaw and Lakota Sioux tribes and communities and the Southcentral Foundation in Anchorage, Alaska, to study awareness, knowledge and attitudes about genomics in these communities. The collaboration will help create culturally appropriate research and education programs, as well as tools to develop similar programs in other communities.","Published: May 18, 2016"

But scientists have long struggled to understand why some patients develop severe malaria. The University of Washington s International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research in South Asia   along with partners at the Center for Infectious Disease Research (CIDR) andGoa Medical College (GMC) of India   have discovered that specific types of parasite proteins, when combined with high parasite biomass, strongly predict severe malaria disease in adults. The discovery, published May 16 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is a significant advancement in understanding the causes of severe malaria. Quantitative characterization of disease presentations and biotechnology capabilities at the ICEMR lab at Goa Medical College combined with specialized assays for molecular host-parasite interactions and machine learning tools at the CIDR helped unlock the mysteries of what leads to the development of severe malaria disease. In India, malaria kills 50,000 to 100,000 people each year, accounting for approximately 20 percent of malaria deaths globally. In south and southeast Asia, severe malaria primarily occurs in adults. The molecular basis for severe manifestations of the disease in adults is not well-understood. This study, led by Joseph Smith and colleagues at Seattle-based CIDR and the University of Washington, shows that in patients with severe malaria, red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite bind to a key regulatory protein on blood vessels, endothelial protein C receptor. Adhesion proteins from the malaria parasite facilitate this interaction. The researchers found that expression of these parasite proteins, accompanied by high parasite load, predicts severe manifestations in adults with malaria. These findings may help develop future treatments for severe malaria. This multi-institutional collaboration is part of MESA-ICEMR, the Malaria Evolution in South Asia (MESA) initiative based at the UW International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) and funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. With the approval and support of the Indian Council of Medical Research, this program has established new malaria research sites across India, including one at Goa Medical College.  Such complex interactions between physicians, scientists, and patients are possible due to the local leadership of Dr. Edwin Gomes, the Head of the Department of Medicine at Goa Medical College,  said Laura Chery, associate director of the MESA-ICEMR. The MESA-ICEMR has enrolled more than 1,000 malaria patients at GMC since April 2012.  This study, involving CIDR, GMC and UW, is a model for how US-India partnerships can contribute to our understanding of a potentially lethal disease,  said co-author Pradipsinh Rathod, UW professor of chemistry and MESA-ICEMR Program Director.","Published: May 18, 2016"

It can be triggered by different types of microbes (such as viruses and bacteria). To combat infections, the body turns on antimicrobial genes that cause the production and release of inflammatory chemicals into the affected site and bloodstream. This response is essential for the body s protection, but its over-activation can cause widespread and exaggerated inflammation that can result in tissue damage, organ failure, and sometimes death. A team of scientists led by Dr. Ivan Marazzi at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai investigated antimicrobial gene activation during infection to better understand the body s immune response to microbes. The research was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Results appeared online on April 28, 2016, in Science. The researchers exposed mouse and human cells infected with flu viruses to various chemicals that block gene activation. By looking at the expression of genes known to be turned on during viral infection, they observed that one chemical, camptothecin (CPT), reduced virus-induced gene activation. CPT blocks a DNA enzyme called topoisomerase 1 (Top1). Genetic depletion of Top1 in flu virus-infected cells reduced the expression of 84 genes predominantly genes that are specifically induced in response to infection. Another drug that's similar to CPT and also blocks Top1, topotecan (TPT), prevented the activation of antimicrobial genes in human cells infected with either bacteria or Ebola virus. The researchers mapped the genomic distribution of TPT and found that TPT sits near regions of DNA that turn on antimicrobial genes, called promoters. Top1 is reduced at such sites when TPT is present. The scientists administered CPT to mice with severe inflammatory responses. They found that 70% to 94% of mice treated with the drug were rescued from a lethal reaction caused by either infection with the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, co-infection with both a flu virus and Staphylococcus aureus, or acute liver failure. Together, the results suggest that drugs that inhibit Top1 may help control dangerous inflammatory responses.  Our findings suggest a therapeutic usage of Top 1 inhibition for the treatment of severe-and sometimes lethal inflammatory conditions in people affected by sepsis, pandemics, and many congenital deficiencies associated with acute inflammatory episodes what is known as a cytokine, or inflammatory, storm,  says Marazzi. Drugs that are similar to CPT, such as TPT, are already FDA-approved as anticancer agents. More studies are needed to test whether they would be useful for treating sepsis.","Published: May 18, 2016"

A new study, led by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and published in Brain, has found that exposing migraine sufferers to a narrow band of green light significantly reduces photophobia and can reduce headache severity. See Also: Study shows association between migraine and carpal tunnel syndrome ""Although photophobia is not usually as incapacitating as headache pain itself, the inability to endure light can be disabling,"" said lead author Rami Burstein, PhD, Vice Chair of Research in the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine and Academic Director of the Comprehensive Headache Center at BIDMC, as well as the John Hedley-Whyte Professor of Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School (HMS). ""More than 80 percent of migraine attacks are associated with and exacerbated by light sensitivity, leading many migraine sufferers to seek the comfort of darkness and isolate themselves from work, family and everyday activities."" Five years ago, Burstein and colleagues made the surprising discovery that blue light hurts migraine patients who are blind. This finding prompted the thinking that abnormal sensitivity to light during migraine could be alleviated by blocking blue light. However, because that study involved only blind patients, who cannot detect all colors of light, Burstein and his colleagues devised a way to study the effects of different colors of light on headache in patients without visual impairment. In this new study, Burstein and colleagues found that of all light to which migraine sufferers are exposed, a narrow band of green light worsens migraine significantly less than all other colors of light and that at low intensities green light can even reduce headache pain. The researchers asked patients experiencing acute migraine attacks to report any change in headache when exposed to different intensities of blue, green, amber and red light. At high intensity of light - as in a well-lit office - nearly 80 percent of patients reported intensification of headache with exposure to all colors but green. Moreover, the researchers found unexpectedly that green light even reduced pain by about 20 percent. To understand exactly why green light causes far less pain to patients with migraines, Burstein and colleagues designed experiments in which they measured the magnitude of the electrical signals generated by the retina (in the eye) and the cortex (in the brain) of these patients in response to each color of light. They found that blue and red lights generated the largest signals in both the retina and the cortex and that green light generated the smallest signals. Learn More: Beware, asthma sufferers: Migraines may worsenNext, applying innovative techniques recently developed by Rodrigo Noseda, PhD, also of BIDMC and Assistant Professor at HMS, they used animal models of migraine to study neurons in the thalamus, an area of the brain that transmits information about light from the eye to the cortex. These neurons were found to be most responsive to blue light and least responsive to green light, explaining why the migraine brain responds favorably to green light. ""These findings offer real hope to patients with migraines and a promising path forward for researchers and clinicians,"" said Burstein. Burstein is now working to develop a more affordable light bulb that emits ""pure"" (narrow band wavelength) green light at low intensity, as well as affordable sunglasses that block all but this narrow band of pure green light. Currently, the cost of one such light bulb is prohibitively high, and the technology to block all but pure green light in sunglasses is available only in light microscopy, which is also very costly.

The discovery has near-term implications for increasing the yield of maize and many other staple crops, perhaps by as much as 50%. The newly discovered regulatory pathway, reported today in Nature Genetics, is notable in that it channels signals emanating from a plant's extremities -- emerging young leaves called primordia -- to the stem cell niche, called the meristem, located at the plant's growing tip Plant biologists have long known of another pathway, called the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathway, that regulates stem cell proliferation from within a portion of the meristem itself, called the organizing center (OC). In this canonical pathway, ""the receptor and ligand are [both] expressed in the stem cells, which send signals down to the cells just below, in the OC,"" explains CSHL Professor David Jackson, who led the team that found the new pathway. WUSCHEL is a transcription factor that alters gene expression, and in so doing promotes the proliferation of stem cells, which are totipotent -- capable in plants, as in humans, of developing into cells of any type. In the canonical CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathway, stem cells send back to the OC a negative signal, repressing the signal for proliferation. A similar feedback is established in the newly discovered pathway, although its signal begins in leaves. Having a signal coming from the leaves is new, and exciting because it could act as a kind of environmental sensor, telling totipotent stem cells in the meristem to stop proliferating -- a brake, applied from the older, more developed parts of the plant, for example in response to environmental cues such as available light, nutrients or moisture. Jackson and colleagues identified the receptor for these ""braking signals from the leaves"" in cells in the lower part of the meristem. They named the receptor FEA3. They also discovered the ligand that interacts with the receptor, a protein fragment called FCP1. In a highly consequential extension of the work of discovery, Jackson's team studied maize plants in which FEA3   the receptor for the signal from the leaves   was dysfunctional, owing to a variety of mutations in the FEA3 gene. When FEA3 receptors in the meristem are not able to function at all, ""it is as if they are blind to FCP1,"" says Jackson. The inhibitory signal FCP1 sends from the leaves to the meristem is not received, and stem cells proliferate wildly. The plant makes far too many stem cells, and they give rise to too many new seeds -- seeds the plant cannot support with available resources (light, moisture, nutrients). In such FEA3 mutant plants, maize ears develop that exhibit a quality called fasciation; from their greatly extended meristems, too many baby kernels are generated, which form misshapen, and ultimately yield-poor ears. But when Jackson's team performed a genetic trick, growing plants with so called ""weak alleles"" of the FEA3 gene, function of the FEA3 receptor was only mildly impaired. This moderate failure of the braking signal from outside of the meristem gave rise to a modest, manageable increase in stem cells, and to ears that were significantly larger than ears in wild-type plants. These ears, the product of maize plants grown from weak alleles of FEA3, had more rows of kernels, and up to 50% higher yield overall than wild-type plants. Because the newly discovered FAE3-FCP1 pathway is highly conserved across the plant kingdom, the discovery by Jackson's team holds the prospect of translating into significant increases in yield in all the major staple crops. Before such translational work can proceed, Jackson and colleagues plan to test the newly discovered fea3 alleles in elite varieties of maize and other crops in agricultural trials.","Published: May 17, 2016"

Now, using Diamond Light Source, the UK s synchrotron science facility to shine intense super powerful X-rays into samples, a team from Cardiff University s Systems Immunity Research Institute found the same killer T-cells that cause type 1 diabetes are strongly activated by some bacteria. The team hope this research will lead to new ways to diagnose, prevent or even halt type 1 diabetes.   Cardiff University s Professor Andy Sewell, lead author of the study, said:  Killer T-cells are extremely effective at killing off germs, but when they mistakenly attack our own tissues, the effects can be devastating.   During type 1 diabetes, killer T-cells are thought to attack pancreatic beta cells. These cells make the insulin that is essential for control of blood sugar levels.   When beta cells are destroyed, patients have to inject insulin every day to remain healthy.  Unlike type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes is prevalent in children and young adults, and is not connected with diet. There is little understanding of what triggers type 1 diabetes and currently no cure with patients requiring life-long treatment. In previous studies the Cardiff team isolated a killer T-cell from a patient with type 1 diabetes to view the unique interaction which kills the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.  They found these killer T-cells were highly  cross-reactive , meaning that they can react to lots of different triggers raising the possibility that a pathogen might stimulate the T-cells that initiate type 1 diabetes.  Cardiff University s Dr David Cole said:  Killer T-cells sense their environment using cell surface receptors that act like highly sensitive fingertips, scanning for germs.   However, sometimes these sensors recognise the wrong target, and the killer T-cells attack our own tissue. We, and others, have shown this is what happens during type 1 diabetes when killer T-cells target and destroy beta cells.   In this new study, we wanted to find out what was causing these T-cells to kill beta cells. We identified part of a bug that turns on killer T-cells so they latch onto beta cells. This finding sheds new light on how these killer T-cells are turned into rogues, leading to the development of type 1 diabetes.  The research, published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, provides a first ever glimpse of how germs might trigger killer T-cells to cause type 1 diabetes, but also points towards a more general mechanism for the cause of other autoimmune diseases.   Dr Cole added:  We still have much to learn about the definitive cause of type 1 diabetes and we know that there are other genetic and environmental factors at play.   This research is significant as it pinpoints, for the first time, an external factor that can trigger T-cells that have the capacity to destroy beta cells.  Professor Melanie Welham, Chief Executive at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), who co-funded the study, said:  This demonstrates the value of research that explores the fundamental cell biology of the immune system.   Finding the cellular mechanisms behind the development of autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, could lead to treatments that help us lead longer, healthier lives.  Professor Matthias von Herrath, MD, Professor at La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology and Vice President at NovoNordisk commented:  Type 1 diabetes is a very serious and hard to treat condition affecting mainly young people.   This new finding, demonstrating how external factors may trigger T-cells to  wake-up  and start attacking beta cells, helps to explain how this disease develops and could shape the future direction of new treatments and diagnostics. Prof Dave Stuart, Diamond s Director of Life Sciences comments,  The UK has one of the highest rates of type 1 diabetes in the world. Gaining a detailed insight into exactly how bacteria can turn on killer T-cells so they latch onto and destroy beta cells is a significant step forward for researchers working to develop new treatments for this serious life-long condition.  We are delighted that Diamond s crystallography capabilities and expertise have helped to uncover this important information.  Here at Diamond, we ve been building our structural biology facilities to include cryo-electron microscopy and fragment screening.  We can therefore help the UK research community to tackle more challenging problems and progress their structural biology work further down the drug development pipeline.  We expect these new capabilities to benefit those working on type 1 diabetes, as well as a host of other illnesses including cancer, heart disease and dementia.  The Cardiff study was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) UK, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), and the Wellcome Trust, using facilities provided by Diamond Light Source.","Published: May 17, 2016"

They discovered a new vulnerable site on HIV for a vaccine to target, a broadly neutralizing antibody that binds to that target site, and how the antibody stops the virus from infecting a cell. The study was led by scientists at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of NIH. The new target is a part of HIV called the fusion peptide, a string of eight amino acids that helps the virus fuse with a cell to infect it. The fusion peptide has a much simpler structure than other sites on the virus that HIV vaccine scientists have studied. The research team first examined the blood of an HIV-infected person to explore its ability to stop the virus from infecting cells. The blood was good at neutralizing HIV but did not target any of the vulnerable spots on the virus where broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bnAbs) were known to bind. The researchers isolated a powerful bnAb in the blood that they named VRC34.01, and found that it binds to the fusion peptide and a sugar molecule. The scientists then crystallized the antibody while it was bound to the virus. This allowed them to characterize in atomic-level detail how VRC34.01 attaches to HIV and revealed that the antibody stops the virus from infecting a cell by binding to a key cell-surface molecule. The scientists also report that it is not unusual for the immune system to try to stop HIV from infecting a cell by attacking the fusion peptide. When they screened the blood of 24 HIV-infected volunteers, they found that blood samples from 10 people targeted a similar binding site as VRC34.01. The researchers are now working to create a vaccine designed to elicit antibodies similar to the VRC34.01 antibody.","Published: May 17, 2016"

Although still in its infancy, this research could explain how small and seemingly innocuous injuries leave molecular  footprints  which add up to more lasting damage, and ultimately chronic pain. All of us are likely to know someone who suffers from persistent pain   it is a very common condition, which can be caused by sports injuries, various diseases and the process of ageing. Treatment options are limited and doctors are often unable to offer anything more than partial relief with painkillers, leaving their patients resigned to suffering. While chronic pain can have many different causes, the outcome is often the same: an overly sensitive nervous system which responds much more than it normally would. However, a question still remains as to why the nervous system should remain in this sensitive state over long periods of time, especially in instances where the underlying injury or disease has gone. Researchers from King s sought to answer this question by examining immune cells in the nervous system of mice, which are known to be important for the generation of persistent pain. In the study, published today in Cell Reports, they found that nerve damage changes epigenetic marks on some of the genes in these immune cells. Epigenetics is the process that determines which gene is expressed and where. Some epigenetic signals have direct functional consequences, while others are just primers: flags that indicate a potential to act or be modified. The cells examined in this King s study still behaved as normal, but the existence of these novel epigenetic marks may mean that they carry a  memory  of the initial injury. Dr Franziska Denk, first author of the study, from the Wolfson Centre for Age Related Diseases at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King s College London, said:  We are ultimately trying to reveal why pain can turn into a chronic condition. We already knew that chronic pain patients have nerves that are more active, and we think this is probably due to various proteins and channels in those nerves having different properties. However, it is unclear why these nerves should remain in this overactive, highly sensitive state, even when the initial injury or disease has gone: the back pain from two years ago that never quite went away or the joints that are still painful despite your rheumatoid arthritis being in remission.  Dr Denk added:  We want to know why these proteins and channels should maintain their altered function over such a long period of time. Cells have housekeeping systems by which the majority of their content are replaced and renewed every few weeks and months - so why do crucial proteins keep being replaced by malfunctioning versions of themselves? Our study is the very first step towards trying to answer this question by exploring the possibility that changes in chronic pain may persist because of epigenetics. We hope that future research in this area could help in the search for novel therapeutic targets.  Professor Stephen McMahon from the IoPPN at King s College London said:  This research raises many interesting questions: do neurons also acquire epigenetic footprints as a result of nerve injury? Do these molecular footprints affect the function of proteins? And are they ultimately the reason that chronic pain persists in patients over such long periods of time?  The last question is particularly hard to answer, because to study epigenetics we need access to pure cell populations. Obviously, many of these are only accessible in postmortem tissue. However, colleagues at King s are already doing this in psychiatry, through studies such as the The PsychENCODE project, so it is possible.  Dr Giovanna Lalli, Neuroscience & Mental Health Senior Portfolio Developer at the Wellcome Trust, which part-funded the study, said: 'People develop chronic pain for a huge variety of reasons. We therefore need an equally diverse range of treatments to tackle the different root causes. 'The clues from this study, suggesting epigenetic changes may be involved in pain persisting, will hopefully lead us to better understand the mechanisms underlying chronic pain.' This research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and an MRC ERA-NET Neuron grant.","Published: May 17, 2016"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/potent-therapeutic-warheads-that-target-cancer-cells-205733,Potent Therapeutic  Warheads  That Target Cancer Cells Scripps scientists have developed molecular  warheads  that could be used to treat cancer  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a pair of related studies, chemists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have identified and designed dozens of molecular  warheads  that not only can detect a key biomarker of cancer, but also could be developed into a potent new class of drug candidates for a range of diseases. A number of these molecules are already  hidden  in drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), raising the possibility that these widely used pharmaceuticals could be made even more effective using more potent/selective covalent inhibitors or  warheads.  The studies, which were published recently in the journals Chemical Science and Chemical Communication, were led by TSRI Associate Professor Kate Carroll. The molecules in question are known as  nucleophiles  (literally, nucleus lovers), which share their electrons with  electrophiles  (literally, electron lovers) and serve as their atomic dance partners. This sharing of electrons creates an interaction known as a covalent bond, which some consider the fundamental basis of chemical reactivity. Electrophiles have been available to the scientific community for decades for use as tools to probe levels of cysteine sulfenic acid a marker for cancer and other diseases and to install as  warheads  or covalent modifiers in drugs that target high levels of sulfenic acid in cells. The downside of electrophiles is that they compete with high concentrations of off-target nucleophiles in the cell, such as glutathione. In addition, this class of covalent inhibitors indiscriminately targets the protein in healthy and diseased cells.  To counteract this effect, our complementary approach would use nucleophile  warheads  attached to a binding scaffold that would target sulfenic acid on therapeutically important proteins in unhealthy cells under oxidative stress,  said Carroll. To produce a library of  designer  nucleophiles with far greater reactivity, Carroll and her colleague, Senior Research Associate Vinayak Gupta, developed a unique screen. So far, some of the nucleophiles they identified possess more than 200 times the current standard for sulfenic acid probes.  We now have about 150 of these  warheads  in our library,  Carroll said. While the greater interest in the scientific community has been in electrophiles, the TSRI team also examined previously unidentified nucleophilic functional groups, such as those within the Pfizer rheumatoid arthritis drug tofacitinib (XELJANZ ).  The nucleophiles we identified in this study represent the first covalent strategy to target sulfenic acid that should be highly enabling for the drug discovery community,  Gupta said.  Moreover, our findings that tofacitinib reacts robustly with sulfenic acid shows that  warheads  or other functional groups in these drugs may indeed have new or alternative mechanisms of action.  Carroll added,  Tofacitinib may have multiple modes of action that include a nucleophile targeting cysteine sulfenic acid in the active site of JAK kinases. If the nucleophile contributes positively to therapeutic outcome, it might be possible to optimize that chemical property and make the drug more effective.  Carroll says she uncovers more instances of nucleophiles  hidden in plain sight  every day, suggesting that nucleophiles may, in fact, be unsung central players in these reactions.","Published: May 17, 2016"

For Dr. Fernando Martinez and his colleagues at the UA Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, this study follows 30 years of research to prevent and cure the chronic disease. ""Asthma is a disease that affects 10 percent of all children in the U.S., significantly impacting their ability to thrive,"" said Martinez, who will lead the nationwide research effort. ""With this new study, we have the opportunity to identify children at the earliest stages of life who are at highest risk for disease and initiate early therapies to minimize respiratory tract illness,"" he said. ""Following these children during the preschool years will further enhance our understanding of the disease, provide additional precision approaches to therapy and lead to optimal prevention strategies and   hopefully   a cure."" The study, ""Oral Bacterial Extracts (ORBEX): Primary Prevention of Asthma and Wheezing in Children,"" is funded by a cooperative agreement grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. ""The University of Arizona is laser-focused on research that creates positive impact by bringing the best minds and the latest technology to bear on curing disease and improving health around the world,"" said UA President Ann Weaver Hart. ""The work of Dr. Martinez and his colleagues is a wonderful example of how the creativity and insight of UA scientists spans across continents and disciplines, and I am so proud that they are working to better understand and   we hope   find a cure for a debilitating disease."" Taking part in the study will be seven other prestigious research institutions across the United States: Columbia University Medical Center, Emory University School of Medicine, George Washington University/Children's National Health System, Harvard University/Boston Children's Hospital, Penn State University College of Medicine, the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, and the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The study, based at the UA Health Sciences' Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, will enroll more than 1,000 babies, 6 to 18 months old, who are considered at high risk for developing asthma. High-risk factors include having a parent with asthma or a diagnosis of eczema, or both. Infants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group that receives the preventive medicine   a bacterial extract   or a control group that gets a nonactive placebo treatment. The medicine will be administered over two years. In the third year, researchers will document whether the babies who received the medicine have fewer asthma symptoms than those who received the placebo. Dr. Joe G.N. ""Skip"" Garcia, UA senior vice president for health sciences, said the Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center team ""is going to catapult our understanding of the disease, including the genetic and environmental factors that cause asthma. Dr. Martinez and his colleagues have the scientific expertise and the personal passion to end asthma in our lifetime. This study and the national scope of the clinical trial moves us toward a population health perspective in asthma research."" Years of research by Martinez and colleagues have shown that exposure to environmental bacteria in children younger than age 6 actually can strengthen the child's immune system and reduce the child's risk of developing asthma. Other studies compared asthma rates in children who live in relatively microbe-depleted urban homes to those who live on farms, where they are exposed to livestock and dusty barns. Those children are much less likely to develop asthma than their urban counterparts. Martinez became familiar with a naturopathic powder developed in the 1970s in Switzerland. A study had shown that the powder, mixed with juice and given to preschool children, decreased wheezing illnesses, which often are the first manifestation of asthma in early life. ""If we could prevent those illnesses, we may be able to prevent the alterations in the lung that predispose children for a lifetime of chronic asthma. The product also has a very good safety profile after decades of use in children as young as 6 months of age,"" Martinez said. ""This could be transformational. For the first time, this could give us hope that we can prevent this disease."" Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that cause asthma, and finding a way to cure or prevent the disease, has been the primary focus of Martinez s internationally respected research career. Growing up in Santiago, Chile, Martinez remembers when he was 3 years old watching his mother struggle to breathe during a severe asthma attack. His mother s attacks continued, and so did his fear of losing her to the disease that made it so hard for her to breathe. Martinez said, ""I remember vividly, it's kind of ingrained in my brain, that I promised to myself that I would cure this disease one day, or better yet, find a way to keep it from happening in the first place."" Dr. Wayne Morgan, pediatric pulmonologist and principal investigator for the UA portion of the study, said: ""Researchers across the world have tried to prevent the development of wheezing illness and asthma for decades. However, studies either reducing or increasing exposures to allergens early in life or using probiotics such as lactobacillus have had disappointing results and likely are not the way forward. Our current study seeks to stimulate the immune system in a safe manner in early life to prevent wheezing illness and, hopefully, the later development of asthma.""","Published: May 17, 2016"

The collaboration will support the translation of novel discoveries from MSK laboratories into first-in-field microbiome therapeutics across multiple new cancer indications, where the microbiome may play a critical role. Seres and MSK have agreed to collaborate in two diverse areas of focus related to the discovery and development of microbiome therapeutics: (1) improving the morbidity and mortality outcomes of patients undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) for treatment of cancer, by prevention of Transplant-Related Infections and Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD); and (2) increasing the efficacy and safety of checkpoint inhibitors used for immuno-oncology treatment. Both areas will be targeted using rationally-designed consortia of microbiome bacteria, a technology which Seres has pioneered in other therapeutic areas. Seres and MSK have agreed to work jointly under a multi-year sponsored research agreement where Seres will collaborate with MSK investigators to study patient samples from MSK clinical studies, generating microbiome metagenomic signatures as well as other clinical data that are expected to aid in the design of novel microbiome therapeutics in these targeted disease states. The agreements also provide Seres with a global license to MSK's intellectual property related to the use of bacterial compositions in treating HSCT patients and related areas, further bolstering Seres' broad existing composition of matter and method of use patent estate. ""MSK scientists have been at the forefront of research into the crucial role of the microbiome in disease, and we believe our combined insights and capabilities could be strongly synergistic and pave the way toward clinically meaningful therapeutic applications for patients with various cancers and serious conditions related to their treatment,"" said Roger Pomerantz, M.D., President, CEO and Chairman of Seres. In HSCT, MSK investigators, led by Marcel van den Brink, M.D., Ph.D., have published clinical studies demonstrating a relationship between the diversity and composition of the microbiome in HSCT patients and their increased risk of bacterial infections and GVHD, both of which contribute to overall all-cause mortality.1,2 Seres is currently developing SER-155, a rationally-designed, preclinical stage therapeutic candidate comprised of in vitro cultured bacterial species that aims to improve morbidity and mortality outcomes in HSCT patients. In the area of immuno-oncology, researchers from Seres and MSK will also work together with the goal of discovering precisely how the microbiome could improve the efficacy and safety of immuno-oncology checkpoint inhibitors. This research builds upon a recent MSK publication which describes, for the first time, the important role of the microbiome in the development of immunological adverse events in patients, and related preclinical work showing that the microbiome can enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors.3,4 ""We are looking forward to collaborating with Seres, a global leader in the development of microbiome therapeutics, as we work together to advance our collective insights into meaningful clinical advances for patients. Based upon our research in cancer patients as well as animal models at MSK, we believe there is potential to improve patient outcomes by addressing the critical roles of the microbiome,"" said Dr. van den Brink.","Published: May 17, 2016"

With their free, public projects, MyGene.info and MyVariant.info, researchers around the world have a faster way to spot new connections between genes and disease.  This is about how to deliver information quickly to biologists,  said Chunlei Wu, associate professor of molecular medicine at TSRI. Wu and TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Su co-led a new study published in the journal Genome Biology reporting on progress in setting up these services and the positive response from users so far. Good News, Bad News Here s the good news: Genetic sequencing is faster and more affordable these days, giving scientists a better understanding of mechanisms behind many diseases. The bad news? This flood of genetic data means scientists have to wade through multiple databases and PDF files to gather useful information. Wu said he has spent hours downloading and parsing data, often running into problems when he discovers that the original data creators didn t annotate information in a standard way. With support from the National Institutes of Health s (NIH)  Big Data to Knowledge  (BD2K) initiative, Wu, Su and their colleagues have begun to tame this problem by creating a data-harvesting platform to automatically import and update data from a variety of public databases. The data they aggregate are then structured and delivered via two high-performance web search services, MyGene.info and MyVariant.info, powered by the latest cloud-computation technology.  Now researchers can focus on their own work instead of going through the data-wrangling effort,  said Wu. MyGene.info and MyVariant.info are also powerful because of their ability to scale up as the user base and datasets grow. MyGene.info holds information on more than 13 million genes from about 15,000 species. The service receives four to five million user  queries  each month, and the researchers are prepared to accommodate even more by expanding their use of Amazon cloud servers. MyVariant.info currently covers more than 316 million unique variants gathered from 14 community data sources. The services have received positive feedback from the research community so far, said Ginger Tsueng, scientific outreach project manager in the Su lab and co-author of the new study. In just this year, MyVariant.info has received more than four million hits, while MyGene.info has handled more than 17 million. A Foundation for Future Applications The researchers have made these services open source to encourage others to use the data and develop their own applications. For example, researchers at the University of Washington have built an interface that retrieves data from MyGene.info and contributes additional information to run MyGene2.org, a site that aims to connect patients who share rare genetic diseases. MyGene.info also provides the backbone for BioGPS, a resource for learning about gene and protein function, run by Su, Wu and TSRI programmer Max Nanis. Another project in the pipeline is an app built on the MyVariant.info platform that displays variants when a user scans a gene name from a poster at a scientific conference, for example.  Bioinformatics tools and analyses are highly dependent on having solid foundations of other tools on which to build,  said Su.  MyGene.info and MyVariant.info are key pieces of infrastructure that many bioinformaticians are using every day. ","Published: May 17, 2016"

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/gene-expression-controls-revealed-195450,Gene Expression Controls Revealed  Researchers have modelled every atom in a key part of the process for switching on genes  revealing a whole new area for potential drug targets  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Proteins are essential for processes that sustain life. They are created in cells through a process called gene expression, which uses instructions from stretches of DNA called genes to build proteins. Sometimes genes are faulty and create proteins that contain errors, preventing the cell from functioning properly. These lead to genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis and haemophilia. Gene expression is controlled by molecules called transcription factors, which bind to the start of a gene sequence at its  basal machinery  and tell it to switch on and start creating certain proteins. The way transcription factors bind to the basal machinery is a  fuzzy  process, meaning the exact sequence of events is unknown because the steps do not exist for long enough to be captured by traditional imaging techniques. But now, by creating a computer simulation of all of the tens of thousands of atoms making up the process and modelling their movements in 50 million separate steps, researchers at Imperial College London have been able to determine the sequence of events that lead to genes being switched on. DISRUPTING DETRIMENTAL GENES The simulated process revealed  pockets  in the gene basal machinery, which the transcription factors move in and out of during binding. Knowing how these structures fit together could lead to the design of molecules that interfere with or disrupt the process, potentially tackling diseases. Lead researcher Dr Robert Weinzierl from Imperial s Department of Life Sciences said:  For the first time, we can fill in the dynamic landscape of interaction between transcription factors and basal machinery. This is a central mechanism for gene expression   the interactions here determine whether a gene gets switched on and creates proteins.""  Gene regulation is a completely new drug target that has previously been too challenging to explore,  added Dr Weinzierl.  This process influences biology on a really fundamental level, and could allow us to prevent the expression of detrimental genes.  FASTER DRUG SCREENING The researchers  new technique predicts the movements of all the atoms in order to build up a picture of the structures involved changing every couple of femtoseconds - quadrillionths of a second. The results of the first trial of the technique are reported today in PLOS Computational Biology. Dr Weinzierl has submitted a patent application for his computer-based approach to studying gene expression interactions. Using this, compounds could be screened for possible fit into the basal machinery pockets.  With computer simulation, it becomes easy to identify candidate compounds that could target these interactions without the need to test them first in real life, cutting down the time required to sift for new drugs,  said Dr Weinzierl.","Published: May 17, 2016"

Hank Bass, associate professor of biological science at FSU, and Daniel Vera, director of the FSU Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, combined their expertise in maize genome mapping with the statistical genomics expertise of colleagues at Cornell University, Eli Rodgers-Melnick and Ed Buckler. Together they found that a small portion of chromatin   the complex of DNA and its associated proteins   accounts for 40 percent of heritable trait diversity in maize. That means a small portion of the chromatin holds a vast amount of information that accounts for traits such as plant size, shape, yield and stress response.  What blew me away about this work is how informative this chromatin profiling technique is at mapping the functionally important part of the maize genome,  Bass said. The research is published in the May 16 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Identifying this part of the genome greatly narrows the area that is examined for maize breeding and genomic editing, which may greatly accelerate the pace for crop improvement. This means growers might be able to more quickly target areas of the genome that could help them develop crops that are more drought resistant or durable in adverse environments.  It allows us to start pinpointing the single base pair changes [small mutations] that are regulating or allowing plants to adapt to their environment,  Buckler said.  It helps us narrow down the hunt dramatically.  Maize is considered a model species for scientific research because it has exceptional genetic diversity and resources, underwriting decades of breakthrough research in mechanisms of heredity. This new study helps explain how an organism can express different genes in different cell types despite the fact the DNA must be compacted to nearly 1 millionth its length to fit inside the cell nucleus. Even when compacted, there still exists areas called open chromatin that coordinate complex patterns of gene regulation. Researchers wanted to better understand what was happening in this space of open chromatin. The study represents the first application of the chromatin profiling technique that Vera and Bass developed as part of an NSF-funded project at Florida State University.   For this, Cornell sent 600 kernels to FSU where Bass and Vera grew them into seedlings, collected tissue from the roots, stems and leaves, and then isolated the cell nuclei. The nuclei were exposed to an enzyme that cuts specific portions of the DNA, and the data were computationally and statistically analyzed to identify the open chromatin in the genome.  It s like finding a light switch on the wall,  Bass said.  The chromatin profiling shows you which parts of the genome are genetic switches.

When it comes into contact with the nasal mucous membrane, however, pollen releases a host of other substances in addition to allergens. In a pilot study, a team of researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen investigated for the first time the effects of these substances on allergy sufferers. It emerged that the non-allergenic components of pollen have a significant influence on the way the body reacts. The results of the study suggest that it may be time to rethink the current methods of treating allergies. In April and May, birch pollen makes life miserable for many people. The body s defense mechanism is primarily triggered by a protein called Bet v 1, which is the main allergen of birch pollen. For a team of researchers under Prof. Claudia Traidl-Hoffmann from TUM, however, this allergen is not the focus of their interest. Instead, their study involved filtering the metabolic products of birch pollen so that only non-allergenic low molecular substances remained in the extract   that is, substances with particularly small molecules. One part of the experiment saw the researchers performing a skin prick test on hay fever sufferers with various combinations of allergens and low molecular substances. They also administered some of the mixtures through the nasal passages of the study participants. The results were clear: In both the skin prick test and the nasal inhalation approach, the reactions were much stronger when the low molecular substances were administered along with the allergen. In cases where both were injected under the skin, extremely pronounced reddening and swelling occurred. When the mixture was administered through the nose, the study participants experienced a strong build-up of mucus and their immune systems produced a large number of antibodies. No effect was discernible, however, when the low molecular substances were administered by themselves to the allergy sufferers. Reaction Not Limited To Those Allergic To Birch Pollen The researchers noticed that the birch pollen extract did not just have an effect on the test subjects who react to Bet v 1. The effect was also evident in those who are allergic to grass pollen and who were nasally administered the corresponding allergen in combination with the birch pollen extract. The explanation behind this is that many of the low molecular substances also occur in other plant pollens.  The inflammatory effect of the low molecular components is non-specific, i.e. it is not connected to any one allergen,  explains Claudia Traidl-Hoffmann.  We suspect that effects could even be noticed in people who do not suffer from allergies.  The birch pollen extract contains as many as 1,000 different low molecular substances. The researchers were able to identify some of the components that heighten allergic reactions in earlier studies   components like adenosine and various fatty acids. Irrespective of the fact that scientists do not yet understand how all of these components work, it seems that the interaction between different substances also plays an important role in the occurrence and effects of allergies.  The human organism is a complex system. We can hardly expect to pinpoint the cause of allergies to one single substance,  comments Traidl-Hoffmann. Negative Effects On Immunotherapy The finding that non-allergenic substances in pollen have a major influence on the body s response could have a lasting impact on the medical treatment of allergies. During specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitization), doctors currently administer a pollen extract in liquid form containing all the components of pollen. This means that components like the low molecular substances investigated in this particular study also make their way into the human organism.  At present, only 60 to 70 percent of hypo-sensitization therapies work,  points out Traidl-Hoffmann. One reason for this might be the presence of non-allergenic but pro-inflammatory contents that could have a negative impact on treatment. A more helpful way to treat allergy sufferers could be vaccination with recombinant proteins, which are derived from biotechnology. This would allow selective administration of the allergen by itself so that the body can become accustomed to its effects. To date, recombinant protein therapy has only been developed for people with an allergy to wasp and bee venom.","Published: May 17, 2016"

The scientists then used a drug-like molecule to successfully target this vulnerability, killing cancer cells in the lab and shrinking tumors in mice.  We were looking for targets that drive cancer metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer, and we found one that was very specific to this type of cancer,  said Daniel K. Nomura, an associate professor of chemistry and of nutritional sciences and toxicology at UC Berkeley and senior author for the study, which is published online ahead of print in Cell Chemical Biology. Triple-negative breast cancers account for about one in five breast cancers, and they are deadlier than other forms of breast cancer, in part because no drugs have been developed to specifically target these tumors. Triple-negative breast cancers do not rely on the hormones estrogen and progesterone for growth, nor on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Because they do not depend on these three targets, they are not vulnerable to modern hormonal therapies or to the HER2-targeted drug Herceptin (trastuzumab). Instead, oncologists treat triple-negative breast cancer with older chemotherapies that target all dividing cells. If triple-negative breast cancer spreads beyond the breast to distant sites within the body, an event called metastasis, there are few treatment options. Tumor cells develop abnormal metabolism, which they rely on to get the energy boost they need to fuel their rapid growth. In their new study, the research team used an innovative approach to search for active enzymes that triple-negative breast cancers use differently for metabolism in comparison to other cells and even other tumors. Inhibiting cancer metabolism They discovered that cells from triple-negative breast cancer cells rely on vigorous activity by an enzyme called glutathione-S-transferase Pi1 (GSTP1). They showed that in cancer cells, GSTP1 regulates a type of metabolism called glycolysis, and that inhibition of GSTP1 impairs glycolytic metabolism in triple-negative cancer cells, starving them of energy, nutrients and signaling capability. Normal cells do not rely as much on this particular metabolic pathway to obtain usable chemical energy, but cells within many tumors heavily favor glycolysis. Co-author Eranthie Weerapana, an associate professor of chemistry at Boston College, developed a molecule named LAS17 that tightly and irreversibly attaches to the target site on the GSTP1 molecule. By binding tightly to GSTP1, LAS17 inhibits activity of the enzyme. The researchers found that LAS17 was highly specific for GSTP1, and did not attach to other proteins in cells. According to Nomura, LAS17 did not appear to have toxic side effects in mice, where it shrank tumors grown to an invasive stage from surgically transplanted, human, triple-negative breast cancer cells that had long been maintained in lab cultures. The research team intends to continue studying LAS17, Nomura said, with the next step being to study tumor tissue resected from human triple-negative breast cancers and transplanted directly into mice.  Inhibiting GSTP1 impairs glycolytic metabolism,  Nomura said.  More broadly, this inhibition starves triple-negative breast cancer cells, preventing them from making the macromolecules they need, including the lipids they need to make membranes and the nucleic acids they need to make DNA. It also prevents these cells from making enough ATP, the molecule that is the basic energy fuel for cells.  Beyond the metabolic role they first sought to track down, GSTP1 also appears to aid signaling within triple-negative breast cancer cells, helping to spur tumor growth, the researchers found. Technique identifies Achilles  heels Nomura said it was surprising that a single, unique target emerged from the research team s search. The method used by the researchers, called  reactivity-based chemoproteomics,  can quickly lead to specific targetable sites   the Achilles  heels   on proteins of interest, and eventually to drug development strategies, Nomura said. The approach is to search for protein targets that are actively functioning within cells, instead of first using the well-trod path of surveying all genes to identify the specific genes that have taken the first step toward protein production. With that more conventional strategy, the switching on, or  expression,  of genes is evidenced by the easily quantified molecule called messenger RNA, made by the cell from a gene s DNA template. Nomura s team instead first used chemical probes that can react with certain configurations of two of the amino acid building blocks of protein   cysteine and lysine   known to be involved in several kinds of important structural and functional transitions that active proteins can undergo.  A lot can happen after the first step in protein production, and we believe our method for identifying fully formed, active proteins is more useful for tracking down relevant differences in cellular physiology,  Nomura said. The researchers analyzed and compared cells from five distinct triple-negative breast cancers that had been grown in cell cultures for generations, along with cells from four distinct breast cancers that were not triple negative. The scientists used a chemical identification technique known as mass spectrometry to narrow down the set of proteins that had active lysines and cysteines to just those that were metabolic enzymes. Only then did they use the more conventional approach of measuring gene expression in the different cancer cell types. GSTP1 was the only metabolically active enzyme that was specifically expressed only in triple-negative breast cancer cells compared to other breast cancer cell types, the researchers found. Separate analysis of databases of human breast cancer by UC San Francisco co-authors confirmed that GSTP1 is overexpressed in patients with triple-negative breast cancers in comparison to patients with other breast cancers. In addition to Nomura and Weerapana, study authors included Sharon Louie, Elizabeth Grossman, Lucky Ding, Tucker Huffman and David Miyamoto, from UC Berkeley; Roman Camarda and Andrei Goga, from UC San Francisco, and Lisa Crawford, from Boston College. Study funders included the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Searle Scholar Foundation.","Published: May 17, 2016"

The paper highlights the potential of  big data  to unlock the secrets inside cancer cells and enable the development of more effective personalised treatments. Professor Lawler is also Co-Chair of the Cancer Task Team of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), which was established in 2013 to create a common framework for the responsible, voluntary and secure sharing of patients  clinical and genomic data. GA4GH is a partnership between scientists, clinicians, patients and the IT and Life Sciences industry involving more than 400 organisations in over 40 countries, and has published today s paper as a blueprint to enable the sharing of patient data to improve patient outcomes. Professor Lawler said:  The term  big data  refers to huge amounts of information that can be analysed by high-performance computers to reveal patterns, trends and associations. In medical terms, this includes clinical and genomic data that is derived from patients during, for example, diagnostic testing and treatment.  Professor Lillian Siu from Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and the University of Toronto, who is joint lead author on this study said:  With the development of new technologies that have enabled the rapid and affordable profiling of cancer tumours, there has been an explosion of clinical and genomic data. Hospitals, laboratories and research facilities around the world hold huge amounts of this data from cancer patients. But this information is currently held in isolated  silos  that don t talk to each other. It is this lack of information sharing that threatens the advancement of tailored patient care.  According to Professor Lawler:  Cancer is an incredibly complex disease, and it is constantly changing. Each person s cancer is different. The key to staying ahead in the fight against cancer is to properly understand how the disease evolves. We need to look at the big picture and identify patterns between groups of patients, whose information currently resides in different databases and institutions. To do this, we must break down the  data silos  that Professor Siu refers to and ensure that genetic and clinical information is shared.  The aim is to create a type of  cancer genomic internet . Imagine if we could create a searchable cancer database that allowed doctors to match patients from different parts of the world with suitable clinical trials. This genetic matchmaking approach would allow us to develop personalised treatments for each individual s cancer, precisely targeting rogue cells and improving outcomes for patients.  This data sharing presents logistical, technical and ethical challenges. Our paper highlights these challenges and proposes potential solutions to allow the sharing of data in a timely, responsible and effective manner. We hope this blueprint will be adopted by researchers around the world and enable a unified global approach to unlocking the value of data for enhanced patient care.  The paper, entitled  Facilitating a culture of responsible and effective sharing of cancer genome data  is published in Nature Medicine, Volume 22, Number 5, pp 464-471 May 2016.

It is expected that the analysis of the collected data can help to develop predictive models in the future for the management of air quality in urban environments. Traditionally, air sampling for the study of microorganisms is carried out by either filtering the air on a growth medium or filters that are later incubated. However, the most part of the biodiversity of an ecosystem is not cultivable. Aware of this limitation, UPM researchers have designed a device capable of going beyond and to achieve a global overview of the  aerobiota . Accordingly, researchers have developed a new portable autonomous collector of particles in the air in which the air entry is produced by the inertia when coupled to a device or vehicle (car, bus, train, tram, metro, etc.). The air passes into a collecting system through an opening front hole, and then the air crosses a micro-perforated metal plate used as a filter. The resulting particles are collected in an adhesive-coated plate. By varying the vehicle speed in which the system is coupled, we can modify the airflow and the total volume sampled. The system has a low-cost, compact and reusable design. The development of this new sensor has been carried out by the UPM research group of Bioengineering and Materials (BIO-MAT) in the framework of a joint research program of the Community of Madrid, AIRBIOTA-CM. This consortium aims to improve the biological pollution knowledge of urban air. By using advanced molecular biology techniques such as the massive DNA sequencing, the captured particles are analyzed in order to identify human and animal pathogens, allergens and their prevalence in different seasons in the Community of Madrid. Besides, considering that recent scientific data suggests a possible biodiversity according to the height, the new system will also allow us to study the air biota at different heights by using drones.   According to UPM researchers,  the collected data will be assessed to develop mathematical models that will allow us to predict changes in the aerobiota composition based on factors such as height, weather or proximity to either industrial or urban environments .

Their findings, published online May 13, 2016, in the Journal of Immunology point to a treatment strategy for the condition known as in gastroschisis, and to the cellular mechanisms within the fetal immune system that may lead to aberrant development. Gastroschisis is a potentially life-threatening condition occurring in approximately one in 2,000 babies born in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Before birth, the fetal immune system develops to a more advanced degree than scientists previously appreciated, according to principal investigator and senior author Tippi MacKenzie, MD, a pediatric surgeon and associate professor in the Department of Surgery at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital San Francisco.  In the past, we had assumed that contact with the amniotic fluid is what causes bowel damage in gastroschisis, but we have now shown that the bowel damage is due to inherent changes in the fetal immune system, which mounts an immune response,  she said.  As a result, our ideas about how we might treat gastroschisis have changed.  Immune Cells, Signaling Molecules Key to Inflammation  The current treatment for gastroschisis involves placing the intestines back in the belly and closing the hole,  said MacKenzie, who is co-director of the UCSF Center for Maternal-Fetal Precision Medicine, which develops new therapies for patients with birth defects.  But the intestines remain inflamed, and the neonates are in the intensive care unit for weeks, sometimes months, just waiting for the intestines to recover. We need to understand what causes this inflammation so we can directly treat it.  In their analysis of umbilical cord blood and intestines of neonatal patients with gastroschisis, and in studies of mice with a form of the anomaly, the researchers identified immune cells and signaling molecules that trigger chronic inflammation, not only within the part of the intestines exposed to amniotic fluid, but also throughout the intestines.  The bowel is not only sick on the outside, where it has been directly exposed to the amniotic fluid,  said first author Michela Frascoli, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the of the Departments of Surgery at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital San Francisco and of UCSF Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine.  We found these cells in the blood in the fetus. This tells us that the inflammation goes throughout the intestines, and unless you treat the fetus systemically, the treatment cannot be expected to cure the inflammation in the bowel.  Surgeons have previously attempted, unsuccessfully, to quiet inflammation by extracting amniotic fluid during pregnancy and replacing it with a saline solution, MacKenzie said.   In the mice, the researchers were able to dampen the immune response with treatment targeted to the immune cells that help trigger it, raising hope for development of a therapy for the chronic inflammation, which is detectible during routine prenatal ultrasound. In the study, the UCSF researchers collected maternal and fetal cord blood at the time of delivery from 27 gastroschisis patients and 23 healthy newborns. Fetal blood in gastroschisis contained elevated levels of inflammatory immune cells and several signaling molecules that help govern immune responses. The researchers also examined surgical samples of intestine and determined that the bowel tissue was flooded with inflammatory immune cells, specifically T cells and eosinophils. Condition More Common in Offspring of Teen Mothers The researchers confirmed the findings using mouse model of the disease. They bred male and female mice that were carriers of a specific gene mutation that resulted in one-quarter of mouse embryos developing gastroschisis in utero. The scientists found that treatment of mouse embryos or mothers with an antibody against a molecule called IL5 reduced the population of inflammatory eosinophils. In January the CDC reported that gastroschisis has increased in prevalence by 30 percent. Children of mothers under age 20 and those who are economically disadvantaged are more likely to be affected, but prevalence has increased in every age group and race. The reason for this increase is puzzling. Another mystery involves the high rate of preterm birth in these patients, which could be related to the fetal inflammation and can worsen the condition, MacKenzie said. Her team is continuing to investigate strategies to quiet inflammation in animal models, with the hope of developing a successful in-utero treatment.","Published: May 17, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/process-analysis-in-real-time-205970,Process Analysis in Real Time With a real time mass spectrometer developed by Fraunhofer researchers  it has become possible for the first time to analyze up to    components simultaneously from the gas phase and a liquid  including in situ analysis   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. This sensitive measurement system is also suitable for the automated monitoring and control of chemical reactions and biotechnological processes.  The automated detection of products or by-products directly during the process has become an indispensable part of monitoring production processes. Mass spectrometry is a quick and selective method of analyzing compounds in technical, chemical and biotechnical applications   simultaneously, with a high degree of sensitivity, and over an extremely large measurement range. Besides the identification of compounds, this method also makes it possible to evaluate the ion currents quantitatively. By means of integrated data evaluation, concentrations of the monitored substances can be determined and changes of concentration   for example in chemical or biochemical reactions   can be measured and recorded. However, detection in process mass spectrometry has till now been limited to compounds from the gas phase. Now researchers from the Fraunhofer Institutes for Chemical Technology ICT, Pfinztal, and Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, have developed a mass spectrometer with which both gases and liquids can be monitored simultaneously in real time. Multiple inlets with integrated membrane The centerpiece of the new, patented measurement system foxySPEC is a modified bypass inlet located on the analyzer unit, with which components from the liquid phase can also be analyzed. A microporous membrane is mounted on this inlet.  Driven by the vacuum on the permeate side, volatile substances from the liquid sample vaporize and pass through the membrane,  Martin Joos from Fraunhofer ICT explains. On the other hand, the membrane is impermeable to polar, aqueous solutions. Additionally, its special spatial structure makes it resistant to clogging by solids. In addition to this, a newly developed measurement sensor makes it possible to carry out even in-situ analysis of liquids, for example in fermenters used for biotechnological production processes. The process engineer Matthias Stier from Fraunhofer IGB describes the advantage:  In such a case the membrane, which is integrated in the measurement sensor, is located directly inside the reactor that is to be monitored.  Due to the physical phase transfer in the chemically inert membrane, the two membrane inlet systems do not display any cross-sensitivity and are very stable in the long term. The new membrane inlets are installed additionally to conventional gas inlets. Automated control for real-time analysis With the control unit, the user can determine which inlet is selected by the sampler. IGB engineer Stephan Scherle explains:  The Siemens programming developed by Fraunhofer IGB enables us to select samples within seconds by using the appropriate valve   switching between gas, liquid and in-situ analysis as required   and therefore providing results in real time.  Also, the quadrupole mass spectrometer employed is equipped with auto-calibration, so that up to 30 components can be detected simultaneously in a complex mixture of substances, without previous separation. A wide range of applications The detection limits of foxySPEC are below 10  g substance per liter and thus in the lower ppm range. Since the gases are sucked into the vacuum system of the detection unit via stainless steel pipes, distances of over 10 meters to the point of withdrawal are feasible. Time-consuming and cost-intensive transfer of the samples by pumping is no longer necessary. Depending on the length and diameter of the stainless steel capillaries, gases can be measured in real time   in the vacuum down to 1 mbar or at overpressure up to 100 bar. The real-time mass spectrometer is suitable for a wide range of applications in the chemical industry and biotechnology, pharmaceutics and food production. Further solutions are to be developed for specific industries. Suitable for Industry 4.0 The low detection limit, the possibility of measuring several components at the same time and the high speed at which data are generated, are ideal prerequisites for making processes more efficient on the basis of continuous monitoring. In terms of the  Industry 4.0  platform, the data can be analyzed in real time using intelligent programs, in order to identify other, previously neglected parameters in processes, and thus further optimize and speed up production. Since foxySPEC detects all masses that enter the measurement system, the unit is not just restricted to one substance, as with most sensors. Consequently foxySPEC can be used flexibly and is the ideal measurement system for demand-driven production.  If various products are being manufactured in a plant in accordance with a customer s requirements, foxySPEC can be used directly as a measuring unit without any need for further conversion or modifications,  says Matthias Stier. Spin-off company and marketing idea Fraunhofer Venture supports the preparation of a spin-off company for the production, sales and marketing, and the remote maintenance of the foxySPEC real-time process mass spectrometer with funds from the program  Fraunhofer promotes Entrepreneurs . The utilization concept developed in this context entails providing foxySPEC with a self-developed connect box, which enables the remote maintenance of the unit. Thus the user does not have to be an expert in the field of mass spectrometry. foxySPEC is to be distributed via a B2B model. Currently the Fraunhofer team of developers is looking for distribution partners who will pass on the system, integrating foxySPEC as part of the user s own system   in a so-called OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) version. foxySPEC is expected to be available on the market from August 2017.","Published: May 17, 2016"

The decision to purchase this spray dryer is simply about scale and expanding the support we can deliver to help further our clients  development programmes. It also demonstrates our commitment to helping drug developers with both simple and complex formulation challenges.  We have provided detailed understanding of drug in polymer development to our clients for over 15 years, so this increase in manufacturing capability is a natural expansion. All going well, we expect our new equipment will be operational by Q4 2016.  The PSD-1 will allow Juniper Pharma Services to provide drug developers with particle engineering options and making amorphous materials to help with solubility and bioavailability challenges. Juniper Pharma Services  clinical trials screening platform has gone from strength to strength since launching in 2014. Run by a dedicated in-house technical group, its offering brought together several advanced processing capabilities including hot melt extrusion (HME), nano milling, self-emulsifying and self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS/SMEDDS), and spray drying, which has enabled the CDMO to investigate, evaluate, and recommend a development pathway to its clients. Its enabling technologies screening initiative was devised to streamline the development of effective and bioavailable drugs and support companies with the rapid processing of products. Dr. Madden-Smith added:  Our screening platform has helped clients make critical decisions at an early stage in the drug development process based on robust data. Spray drying is one of several routes that clients end up adopting so it s essential we have the capabilities and scale in place to help them choose a development pathway that will be the most time, cost, and volume efficient.  Operating from a GMP-compliant facility in Nottingham, Juniper Pharma Services primarily assists pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the development and production of oral and topical drug products. The CDMO focuses heavily on optimising formulation performance through its science-led approach to projects and helping clients develop a robust and scalable process and focusing on viable commercial solutions.","Published: May 17, 2016"

The outcomes proved for the first time that transplanted nerve cells can survive and function in the diseased human brain. Some patients showed marked improvement after the transplantation while others showed moderate or no relief of symptoms. A small number of patients suffered unwanted side-effects in the form of involuntary movements. Ever since the first transplantations were carried out, a fundamental question has been whether the transplanted cells and their neural connections could survive and function over time despite ongoing disease in the patient s brain. Now researchers at Lund University have proven that transplanted nerve cells can survive for many years and restore normal dopamine production in the transplanted part of the brain. The study has been published by the distinguished scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).  Our findings show that transplanted nerve cells can survive and function for many years in the diseased human brain , says Professor Olle Lindvall, one of the researchers behind the study.  This is the first time a patient has shown such a well-functioning transplant so many years after transplantation of nerve cells to the brain. At the same time, we have observed that the transplant s positive effects on this patient gradually disappeared as the disease spread to more structures in the brain.  The researchers followed a patient with Parkinson s disease who underwent transplantation of dopamine-producing nerve cells 24 years before death. The patient showed such marked improvement that medication with L-dopa was no longer necessary three years after the transplantation. Brain-imaging technology allowed the researchers to show that dopamine function was completely normal in the transplanted brain structure ten years after the operation. The new study analyses the patient s brain and the researchers can now prove that the transplanted dopamine-producing cells and their normal neural connections are still present almost a quarter of a century after the operation.  This gives us a better understanding of how Parkinson s disease spreads in the brain , explains Professor Jia-Yi Li, who led the study together with Olle Lindvall and Anders Bj rklund.  This study is completely unique , says Professor Anders Bj rklund.  No transplanted Parkinson s patient has ever been followed so closely and over such a long period. The patient was also unique in the sense that the nerve cells were only transplanted to one hemisphere of the brain, which meant that the other, which did not receive any transplant, could function as a control. What we have learnt from the study of this patient will be of great value for future attempts to transplant dopamine-producing nerve cells obtained from stem cells, a new development led by researchers in Lund.

""We chose pancreatic cancer to test this approach because it is the most aggressive disease of all the cancers."" Cheng had previously led a team of researchers discovering a link between prostate cancer's aggressiveness and the accumulation of a compound produced when cholesterol is metabolized in cells, findings that could bring new diagnostic and treatment methods. The new study involved researchers at the Purdue Center for Cancer Research and School of Biomedical Engineering, the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center and School of Medicine, Purdue's Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Comparative Pathobiology, and Department of Biochemistry. The findings, detailed in a paper published May 2 in the journal Oncogene, suggest a class of drugs previously developed to treat atherosclerosis could be repurposed for treatment of pancreatic cancer and other forms of cancer. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in arteries, restricting blood flow. The researchers found accumulations of the compound cholesteryl ester in human pancreatic cancer specimens and cell lines, demonstrating a link between cholesterol esterification and metastasis. Esterification is a biochemical process that allows cholesterol to be stored in cells. Excess quantities of cholesterol result in cholesteryl ester being stored in lipid droplets within cancer cells. ""The results of this study demonstrate a new strategy for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer by inhibiting cholesterol esterification,"" said Jingwu Xie, the Jonathan and Jennifer Simmons Professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine and a researcher at the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center. The paper's lead author is Purdue post-doctoral fellow Junjie Li. Purdue researchers have developed an analytical tool called Raman spectromicroscopy that allows compositional analysis of single lipid droplets in living cells. ""We identified an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester in human pancreatic cancer specimens and cell lines,"" Li said. ""Depletion of cholesterol esterification significantly reduced pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis in mice."" Findings show that drugs like avasimibe, previously developed for treatment of atherosclerosis, reduced the accumulation of cholesteryl ester. The disease usually kills within a few months of diagnosis. It is hoped the potential new treatment might extend life of pancreatic cancer patients for a year, Cheng said. The accumulation of cholesteryl ester is controlled by an enzyme called ACAT-1, and findings correlated a higher expression of the enzyme with a poor survival rate for patients. The researchers analyzed tissue samples from pancreatic cancer patients and then tested the drug treatment in a type of laboratory mice referred to as an orthotopic mouse model, developed at the IU School of Medicine. Specimens of human pancreatic tissues were obtained from the Simon Cancer Center Solid Tissue Bank. Imaging showed a decrease of the number of lipid droplets, and Raman spectral analysis verified a significant reduction of cholesteryl ester in the lipid droplets, suggesting that avasimibe acted by blocking cholesterol esterification. The drug did not induce weight loss, and there was no apparent organ toxicity in the liver, kidney, lung and spleen, Cheng said. Findings also showed that blocking storage of cholesteryl ester causes cancer cells to die, specifically due to damage to the endoplasmic reticulum, a workhorse of protein and lipid synthesis. ""By using avasimibe, a potent inhibitor of ACAT-1, we found that pancreatic cancer cells were much more sensitive to ACAT-1 inhibition than normal cells,"" he said. ""The results showed that avasimibe treatment for four weeks remarkably suppressed tumor size and largely reduced tumor growth rate,"" said paper coauthor Timothy Ratliff, the Robert Wallace Miller Director of Purdue's Center for Cancer Research. ""Metastatic lesions in lymph nodes and distant organs also were assessed at the end of the study. A much higher number of metastatic lesions in lymph nodes were detected in the control group than the avasimibe-treated group. ""Additional research confirmed that the anti-cancer effect of avasimibe is specific to ACAT-1 inhibition. The researchers performed various biochemical assays and ""genetic ablation"" to confirm the drug's anti-cancer effect. Each mouse in the control group showed at least one metastatic lesion in the liver. In contrast, only three mice in the avasimibe treated group showed a single lesion in liver. Cheng, Li, and Ratliff have founded Resarci Therapeutics LLC at the Purdue Research Park to work toward developing a formulation of the drug for human cancer patients.""We want to bring this to clinical use,"" Cheng said. The researchers will work with IU's Xie to further study the potential treatment.

See Also: Taste perception is influenced by extreme noise conditions ""Taste is an important driver of food intake and invariably associated with distinct neuronal patters in the insula, the brain's primary taste cortex,"" said the study's lead author Guido Frank, MD, a psychiatrist and associate professor at the CU School of Medicine. The study was recently published online in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Frank and his team set out to find if abnormal eating patterns were associated with changes in the insula's ability to classify taste stimuli. Some 106 women of similar age underwent brain imaging while tasting sugar water or a tasteless water solution. Researchers studied how well the insula could differentiate between the flavors. Learn More: Brain scars in multiple sclerosis patients reveal possible cause of taste problems Individuals with anorexia nervosa or those who were obese, had difficulty distinguishing between ordinary water and sugar water, compared to control subjects and those who had recovered from anorexia nervosa. ""If you can't differentiate between tastes, that could impact how much you eat,"" Frank said. ""That could also activate or not activate brain reward circuits."" These changes, he said, could occur on a variety of levels. For example, leptin and other hormones are altered in obesity and eating disorders, affecting how the brain responds to food. At the same time, the reduced ability of the insula to classify taste could be due to structural changes within this brain region or alternatively could result in altered taste signal processing in different pathways to the insula. Research indicates that these problems diminish once a person reaches a healthy weight. Related: Stress hormone receptors localized in sweet taste cells While more research is needed, Frank said one possible treatment could be to alter the taste of food.

According to new research published in Nature, scientists have determined how these sexually dimorphic (occurring in either males or females) connections arise in the worm nervous system. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). See Also: Neural fundamentals: Sex differences in the nervous system ""For decades, there has been little focus on the impact of sex on many areas of biomedical research,"" said Coryse St. Hillaire-Clarke, PhD, program officer on this NINDS project. ""This study helps us understand how sex can influence brain connectivity."" In nematode worms, (Caenorhabditis elegans), a small number of neurons are found exclusively in male or female brains. The remaining neurons are found in both sexes, although their connection patterns are different in male and female brains. Oliver Hobert, PhD, professor of biological sciences at Columbia University in New York City, and his colleagues looked at how these wiring patterns form. Dr. Hobert's team observed that in the worms' juvenile state, before they reach sexual maturity, their brain connections were in a hybrid, or mixed state, comprised of both male and female arrangements. As they reached sexual maturity, however, their brains underwent a pruning process, which got rid of particular connections and led to either male or female patterns. ""We found that differences in male and female brains develop from a ground state, which contains features of both sexes. From this developmental state, distinctly male or female features eventually emerge,"" said Dr. Hobert. Don't Miss: Sex differences in brain may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders more common in males Next, Dr. Hobert's team showed that sex-specific wiring in the brain results in dimorphic behavior. They discovered that PHB neurons, chemosensory brain cells that detect chemical cues in the environment such as food, predators or potential mates, work differently in males and females. In males, these neurons proved to be important in recognizing mating cues while in females, the neurons helped them avoid specific taste cues. However, early in development, PHB neurons in males also responded to signals regulating taste, suggesting that even though those neurons are found in all nematodes, in adults, their functions differ as a result of sex-specific wiring in the brain. Dr. Hobert's team used genetically engineered nematodes to look more carefully at individual connections between brain cells. The researchers found that swapping the sex of individual neurons changed wiring patterns and influenced behavioral differences in males and females. Additional experiments helped to identify genes involved in regulating the pruning process during development. Dr. Hobert's group discovered that certain transcription factors, which are molecules that help control gene activity, are present in a dimorphic state and may help establish male or female connections in the brain. In future experiments, Dr. Hobert and his colleagues plan to examine how these molecules target specific connections for pruning. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

All of us are likely to know someone who suffers from persistent pain   it is a very common condition, which can be caused by sports injuries, various diseases and the process of ageing. Treatment options are limited and doctors are often unable to offer anything more than partial relief with painkillers, leaving their patients resigned to suffering. While chronic pain can have many different causes, the outcome is often the same: an overly sensitive nervous system which responds much more than it normally would. However, a question still remains as to why the nervous system should remain in this sensitive state over long periods of time, especially in instances where the underlying injury or disease has gone. Researchers from King s sought to answer this question by examining immune cells in the nervous system of mice, which are known to be important for the generation of persistent pain. In the study, published today in Cell Reports, they found that nerve damage changes epigenetic marks on some of the genes in these immune cells. Epigenetics is the process that determines which gene is expressed and where. Some epigenetic signals have direct functional consequences, while others are just primers: flags that indicate a potential to act or be modified. The cells examined in this King s study still behaved as normal, but the existence of these novel epigenetic marks may mean that they carry a  memory  of the initial injury. Dr Franziska Denk, first author of the study, from the Wolfson Centre for Age Related Diseases at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King s College London, said:  We are ultimately trying to reveal why pain can turn into a chronic condition. We already knew that chronic pain patients have nerves that are more active, and we think this is probably due to various proteins and channels in those nerves having different properties. However, it is unclear why these nerves should remain in this overactive, highly sensitive state, even when the initial injury or disease has gone: the back pain from two years ago that never quite went away or the joints that are still painful despite your rheumatoid arthritis being in remission.  Dr Denk added:  We want to know why these proteins and channels should maintain their altered function over such a long period of time. Cells have housekeeping systems by which the majority of their content are replaced and renewed every few weeks and months - so why do crucial proteins keep being replaced by malfunctioning versions of themselves? Our study is the very first step towards trying to answer this question by exploring the possibility that changes in chronic pain may persist because of epigenetics. We hope that future research in this area could help in the search for novel therapeutic targets.  Professor Stephen McMahon from the IoPPN at King s College London said:  This research raises many interesting questions: do neurons also acquire epigenetic footprints as a result of nerve injury? Do these molecular footprints affect the function of proteins? And are they ultimately the reason that chronic pain persists in patients over such long periods of time?  The last question is particularly hard to answer, because to study epigenetics we need access to pure cell populations. Obviously, many of these are only accessible in postmortem tissue. However, colleagues at King s are already doing this in psychiatry, through studies such as the The PsychENCODE project, so it is possible.  Dr Giovanna Lalli, Neuroscience & Mental Health Senior Portfolio Developer at the Wellcome Trust, which part-funded the study, said: 'People develop chronic pain for a huge variety of reasons. We therefore need an equally diverse range of treatments to tackle the different root causes. 'The clues from this study, suggesting epigenetic changes may be involved in pain persisting, will hopefully lead us to better understand the mechanisms underlying chronic pain.'","Published: May 16, 2016"

They provide oxygen to power our muscles, catalyze reactions that help us extract energy from food, and fend off infections from bacteria and viruses. For decades, scientists have searched for ways to design new proteins that can serve specific purposes in medicine, research, and industry. Now, researchers at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine have developed a method that creates novel proteins by stitching together pieces of already existing proteins. The technique, called SEWING, is inspired by natural evolutionary mechanisms that also recombine portions of known proteins to produce new structures and functions. This approach can generate a diverse set of protein structures with many of the distinctive features that proteins require to carry out specific biological functions. The findings, published today in the journal Science, could enable researchers to design proteins to play a variety of different roles in human biology and disease, such roles as catalysts, biosensors, and therapeutics.  We can now begin to think about engineering proteins to do things that nothing else is capable of doing,  said senior study author Brian Kuhlman, PhD, professor of biochemistry and biophysics, and member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.  The structure of a protein determines its function, so if we are going to learn how to design new functions, we have to learn how to design new structures. Our study is a critical step in that direction and provides tools for creating proteins that haven t been seen before in nature.  At the chemical level, proteins are composed of long chains of hundreds to thousands of subunits called amino acids   the building blocks of life. The sequence of these amino acids ultimately determines each protein s unique geometry. Some sections of a protein might be folded back and forth onto itself like a paper fan; others might be coiled tightly like a spring. In all, scientists estimate that the human body contains about 100,000 different proteins, each the result of millions of years of evolutionary shuffling, culminating in a precise lineup of pleats, coils, and furrows required to carry out a specific job in the cell. Traditionally, researchers have used computational protein design to recreate in the laboratory what already exists in the natural world. But in recent years, their focus has shifted toward inventing novel proteins with new functionality. These design projects all start with a specific structural  blueprint  in mind, and as a result are limited. Kuhlman and his colleagues believe that by removing the limitations of a pre-determined blueprint and taking cues from evolution they can more easily create functional proteins. To mimic the mechanisms of natural protein evolution, they developed a computer design strategy called SEWING (Structure Extension With Native-substructure Graphs). First, the researchers took a slew of naturally occurring proteins and digitally chopped them up into well-defined pieces, as if turning a bunch of rag dolls into a pile of arms, legs, and heads. Then they performed a series of computational tests to figure out which pieces would fit well together. In nature, this step would involve looking for stretches of amino acid sequences that are similar between proteins. On the computer, it involved searching for regions of structural similarity so that   in the analogy of the rag doll   a hand would end up being stitched to an arm and then a shoulder, and not a head or a hip. First author Tim M. Jacobs, PhD, a former graduate student in the Kuhlman lab, used this method to map out 50,000 of these stitched together proteins on the computer. He then tapped a number of different metrics to whittle down the list to the top 21 proteins, which he produced in the lab. Jacobs and colleagues took pictures of these proteins using x-ray crystallography and NMR, and found that the proteins contained all the unique structural varieties they had designed on the computer.  We were excited that some had clefts or grooves on the surface, regions that naturally occurring proteins use for binding other proteins,  said Jacobs.  That s important because if we wanted to create a protein that can act as a biosensor to detect a certain metabolite in the body, either for diagnostic or research purposes, it would need to have these grooves. Likewise, if we wanted to develop novel therapeutics, they would also need to attach to specific proteins.  Currently, the researchers are using SEWING to create proteins that can bind to several other proteins at a time. Many of the most important proteins are such multi-taskers, including the blood protein hemoglobin that carries four copies of oxygen from the lungs to the body s tissues.","Published: May 16, 2016"

It causes flu-like symptoms with fever and joint pains, which in some cases can last for months with occasional fatalities. No treatment or vaccine exists so far - serving as an urgent reminder of just how poorly the time-consuming process of drug development is able to meet the threat posed by newly emerging viruses. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin have now teamed up with colleagues at the Paris-based Institut Pasteur to validate a new approach in the quest for a therapy   combining high-throughput screening for host cell proteins without which the virus cannot replicate, with so-called  drug repositioning , i.e. utilizing an existing drug for new indications. They identified two existing compounds that were effective against the virus in an animal model. Their findings not only bring a Chikungunya treatment within potential reach, but also provide the proof of principle that this approach can be rapidly successful for newly emerging infectious diseases. The recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks have highlighted how quickly new epidemics can spread in the age of global travel and how helpless modern medicine still is when faced with infectious diseases for which no treatment has been generated. A case in point is Chikungunya fever, which has caused a rising epidemic since it first spread to the Caribbean and Latin America, with more than a million reported cases, and is now poised to spread into the US. While the symptoms are frequently mild, some patients experience crippling arthritic pain that can last for years. Standard drug development procedures are both expensive and time consuming and the success rates are low. However, emerging epidemics require fast reaction. Professor Thomas F. Meyer with his group at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology have now pioneered a new strategy to achieve faster success: In a first step the overall requirement of host factors involved in the infection are identified and then, in a second phase, known drugs effective against the identified host factors are used to block the infection. This rational drug-repositioning strategy could speed up the development process dramatically and allow fast proof of concept. The principle behind the rational drug-repositioning strategy is the emerging concept that all pathogens depend on proteins produced by the host cell in order to replicate successfully. The challenge lies in the identification of such critical host cell targets. The team found more than 100 host proteins to be required by Chikungunya, by using a robotic system at the MPIIB to knock out each human gene in turn, before infecting the cells with the virus and analysing how well it was able to replicate. Together with the Marc Lecuit's group at Institut Pasteur, who are leading experts on the disease, and collaborators at the Steinbeis Innovation Center and the Charit  in Berlin, the University of M nchen and the Institute of Technology in Tartu, Estonia, they next searched for established compounds known to target the most promising host factors before testing them in vitro and in animal models of Chikungunya infection. This process resulted in two drugs, one of them an already widely used antipsychotic, which exhibit therapeutic activity in mice at safe doses, especially when used in combination. Further studies are now required to develop an optimized clinical therapy. Excitingly, the results also revealed another potential benefit:  When we compared the requirement for every human gene in multiple unrelated viruses  explains Dr Alexander Karlas, a leading virologist at MPIIB.  We found that several of the host proteins required by the Chikungunya virus are also required by several other, unrelated viruses as well.  This potentially opens up a path for developing a range of broadly acting antivirals   which may give a much-needed boost in the battle against emerging viruses.","Published: May 16, 2016"

Researchers have known for some time that histones play a role in switching genes on or off in cells by exposing or covering up various parts of the genome, for instance. But they are just beginning to learn about how changes to these non-DNA structures can affect development and health a field known as epigenetics and how they are regulated. Now, for the first time, they ve shown that a change to the structure of a histone can trigger a tumor on its own.  This is the first study to show that a genetic change to non-DNA structures in the cell histones is enough to cause cancer, with no other cooperating DNA mutations,  says co-author Chao Lu, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab ofC. David Allis, Tri-Institutional Professor and Joy and Jack Fishman Professor in the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics at Rockefeller University. A surprising source In earlier work, other researchers had found that in approximately 95 percent of samples of chondroblastoma, a benign tumor that arises in cartilage typically during adolescence, carry a mutation in a histone protein called H3. To explore whether and how the mutation causes the tumor, the researchers inserted the H3 histone mutation into mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), which generate cartilage, bone and fat. They then watched these mutant cells lose the ability to differentiate in the lab. Next, they injected the mutant cells into living mice, and the animals developed the tumors rich in MPCs, known as an undifferentiated sarcoma.  Although researchers knew that a certain type of tumor chondroblastoma carried a mutation in the H3 histone and no other mutation, this is the first study to show that the mutation indeed causes tumors, even without any other DNA mutation present,  says Lu. Next, the researchers tried to understand how the mutation causes the tumors to develop. They found that, when the mutation occurs, the cell becomes locked in a proliferative state meaning it divides constantly, leading to tumors. Specifically, the mutation inhibits enzymes that normally tag the histone with chemical groups known as methyls, allowing genes to be expressed normally. In response to this lack of modification, another part of the histone becomes over-modified, or tagged with too many methyl groups.  This leads to an overall resetting of the landscape of chromatin, the complex of DNA and its associated factors, including histones,  says co-author Peter Lewis, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Allis lab and currently an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This  resetting  is what locks the cell into its proliferative state. A new target The findings suggest that researchers should be on the hunt for more mutations in histones that might be driving tumors, says Lu. Meanwhile, he and his colleagues are trying to learn more about how this specific mutation in histone H3 causes tumors to develop.  For instance, we want to know which pathways cause the mesenchymal progenitor cells that carry the mutation to continue to divide, and not differentiate into the bone, fat, and cartilage cells they are destined to become,  he says. Once researchers understand more about these pathways, says Lewis, they can consider ways of blocking them with drugs, particularly in tumors such as MPC-rich sarcomas which, unlike chondroblastoma, can be deadly.

It s where, for four months, they will represent the rest of their team and strenuously refine the business idea behind Astrona, a pathogen detection startup that originated as one of 13 UC Davis interdisciplinary research programs funded by a grant from the Office of Research. The product they are trying to create is a hand-held device that can be used to detect a variety of pathogens including foodborne pathogens like E. coli at all stages in the food supply chain, from fields to restaurants. And the detection technology is applicable to broad range of pathogens, offering potential for other uses such as in the medical field. The team is now trying to make the leap from a great idea to a viable product. Grappling with the reality that this step may be as difficult, if not more, than the original research, and they are trying to leverage all the resources available to them to increase their chances of success. Accelerators create new ways to launch businesses Startup accelerators like IndieBio, also known as seed accelerators, are business acceleration programs. Other examples include Y-Combinator and the Illumina Accelerator. The model originated about 10 years ago and has grown in popularity for launching new businesses, particularly in California. The application process is competitive, but if accepted, the accelerator provides seed money and an intensive mentoring and networking program in exchange for a share of the startup s equity. Astrona Biotechnologies, Inc., which was founded in 2015 by UC Davis faculty Bryce Falk, Maria Marco, Paul Feldstein, Andre Knoesen, Josh Hihath, Erkin Seker, and Ph.D. students Marc Pollack and Jeremy Warren, is one of 15 companies that are part of IndieBio s spring 2016 cohort. What unifies the cohorts is they are all using biology as the basis of their technology. As part of the program, Astrona may receive up to $200,000 in cash and $50,000 in program support from IndieBio in exchange for 8 percent equity in the company. Cohorts accepted into the accelerator move together through a three- to four-month program that involves mentoring and education, culminating in a  Demo Day  where each team presents its now-refined business plan to potential investors, media and the public. Participating in the accelerator program has been intense for Pollack and Warren, not only because of the long drive and long day (they typically head back to Davis around 7 p.m.), but because of the intense scrutiny given to every aspect of Astrona. Pollack describes a recent mentoring session in which each participant had to examine what purpose they bring to their company.  That kind of intense self-reflection,  which is not something they normally did in the lab,  keeps us focused on why we are here.  But even more than understanding what role they play within the company, the experience is helping the team refine its product concept. Pollack explains,  It is helping us understand how we fit into the general market. A lot of scientists come up with great ideas and they are great in theoretical mindsets, but when you bring it out into the world it s important to understand where it fits in for customers.  A journey with many stepping stones Astrona s technology emerged out of a unique interdisciplinary research seed-funding program, Research Investments in Science and Engineering (RISE). In 2012, the university made a bold investment of $10.8 million to fund the RISE program, assembling teams of experts from different disciplines to address global challenges. Astrona arose from one of 13 teams that received funding from the program, bringing together experts in the fields of plant pathology, food science, electrical engineering and computer engineering.  The accomplishments of the Astrona team exemplifies the effectiveness of interdisciplinary research in finding practical solutions to complex problems,  said Paul Dodd, associate vice chancellor for research.  While the team s initial work focused on illuminating some of the underpinning biological science, they were able to quickly leverage those insights to develop technology for a potential commercial solution.  Funding from the RISE program helped to create a rich team-research learning environment where undergraduate students, early-career faculty and more senior academics were able to work together on problems of common interest. Maria Marco, an associate professor in Food Science & Technology, said the RISE program created a unique opportunity for her.  I would have never started working on my own with Erkin and Josh,  who are both assistant professors in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Marco, who studies the microbiome specifically lactic acid bacteria found in our food and guts said initially there were challenges simply communicating.  Food science, electrical and computer engineering we speak a different language. Even among biologists ecologist and molecular biologists there are different words and we use different definitions. So part of the challenge was learning to use the words in the right way.  Marco sees her role as keeping the team grounded regarding pathogen detection,  This is the food environment,  but she remains excited about the technology they have created.  It has real potential to bridge my world with the electrical engineering world.  She laughs when she describes her initial thoughts about how long it would take.  Naively I thought back in 2012 that the engineers had everything worked out and it was just a matter of me telling them  Okay, I m just going to do a little bit of work to get the nucleic acids out of these pathogens and then we can make a device.  Actually bridging those two points, though, has been far more arduous. She describes what the team has created as  a process  rather than a product at this point, a specific method to capture and amplify nucleic acid signals for different organisms so the organisms can be detected. For the initial product, the team is focusing on organisms that cause foodborne illnesses, such as the nasty E. coliO157:H7. As the team progressed, members connected with UC Davis Venture Catalyst seeking assistance in forming a new company based on their vision for the product. Venture Catalyst provides campus entrepreneurs with guidance and resources to help researchers do just that, as well as offering customized services to help them succeed. Astrona participated in Venture Catalyst s START  program through which, in addition to company formation, it received help in developing the company s business plan and assessing its strategy for commercializing its proprietary pathogen detection technology.  Astrona provides a great example of how campus entrepreneurs can leverage the programs and services offered by the university to translate their cutting-edge research into commercial application,  said Dushyant Pathak, associate vice chancellor of research and executive director of Venture Catalyst.  The early work we do in effectively enabling our campus entrepreneurs, makes our startups more competitive for external resources like those offered by IndieBio.  To manage their teaching load and their work with the startup, the faculty members are using some of their allowed consulting days to work on Astrona (faculty receive 48 days for an annual appointment, 39 days for nine-month appointment). Pollack is still working on his Ph.D. and is doing his Biotech Internship through the Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology with Astrona. Warren has finished his postdoc in Falk s lab and is now working for Astrona full-time. What s next? Preparing for  Demo Day  Back in San Francisco, Pollack and Warren have created a detector (although not quite a product prototype) that they are debugging in time for Demo Day, which will take place this summer. All 15 teams in the spring cohort will participate. The event usually draws about a thousand attendees. Even though it s still a few months off, Warren says getting ready for the presentation feels very rushed.  Our science works, but we need to be able to get up there and show how it works. We have seven minutes to wow everybody. ","Published: May 16, 2016"

A series of nanomaterials, including metal nanoclusters, metal nanocolloids (organosols and hydrosols), metal nanopowders, metal nanoparticles, and magnetic fluids are now available from Strem Chemicals in the UK and Ireland. Close relationships with leading researchers in the field have enabled Strem to stay abreast of the latest scientific advances in and regularly add novel chemicals to our product portfolio. Multi-colour labelling of both fixed and living cells with fluorescent nanoparticles conjugated with biological ligands that specifically bind against certain cellular targets enables the recording of diffusion pathways in receptor cells. Uptake of nanoparticlesinto the vesicular compartments around the nucleus of cells can be used to label the cells so that their pathway and fate can be followed. The nanoparticles exhibit reduced photo bleaching as compared to traditional dyes and are passed on to daughter cells during cell division, therefore allowing for much longer term observation. Magnetic nanoparticles can also act as sensors for assessing how external stresses affect changes in intracellular biochemistry and gene expression. Colloidal gold nanoparticles have been found to strongly enhance the native signals of chemical constituents in cells. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) relies on this signal magnification and serves as a tool for ultra-sensitive monitoring of the intracellular distribution of these chemicals. Colloidal gold bio functionalised Nano modules also have potential for use in enzyme multi-sensors. Gold nanoparticles coated with proteins have been used to detect conformation changes in the attached proteins via observation of colour changes. Strem is the first company in the world to be able to synthesize and stabilize high quality gold nanorods without the use of CTAB. Our ability to manufacture gold nanorods without CTAB/CTA+ will accelerate the adoption of these nanoparticle products for medical and surgical applications.  In addition, our GNR products offer many features, supported by our patent-pending technical advances, that will offer benefits to the primary commercial users of gold nanoparticle products, biotech companies, who make gold Nano rod-enabled point-of-care, point-of-use and In-Vitro diagnostic test kit products.   Early detection of disease remains a primary goal of the medical community. Nanotechnology holds great promise for enabling the achievement of this goal. Nanoparticles in particular have exhibited tremendous potential for detecting fragments of viruses, pre-cancerous cells, disease markers, and indicators of radiationdamage. Gold coatings have made it possible to use toxic cobalt nanoparticles for biomedical applications. Gold coated ferromagnetic nanoparticles tagged with HIV antibodies may be able to detect virus particles left after completion of conventional drug therapy. Metal nanoparticles in the form of dendrimers have also been functionalized with different biomolecules to detect specific proteins, antibodies, and other disease indicators. Fluorescent markers can also be attached to the dendrimers. Biomolecule coated ultra small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles injected in the blood stream recognize target molecular markers present inside cells and induce a specific signal for detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This technology may allow for detection of individual cancer cells months or years earlier than traditional diagnostic tools, which require the presence of hundreds of cancer cells.  A nanoparticle-based bio barcode amplification assay (BCA) utilizes gold nanoparticles and magnetic micro particles attached to large numbers of DNA strands and antibodies for a specific disease marker. The marker binds to the nano- and micro particles forming a complex that is separated from the sample using a magnetic field. Heating the complexes releases the DNA barcodes, which emit an amplified signal due to their large numbers. This BCA technology has been applied to the detection of markers for Alzheimer s disease and is being investigated for numerous others. Targeted drug delivery systems can convey drugs more effectively and/or more conveniently, increase patient compliance, extend the product life cycle, provide product differentiation, and reduce health care costs. Delivery systems that rely on nanomaterials also allow for targeted delivery of compounds characterized by low oral bioavailability due to poor water solubility, permeability and/or instability and provide for longer sustained and controlled release profiles. These technologies can increase the potency of traditional small molecule drugs in addition to potentially providing a mechanism for treating previously incurable diseases. The use of magnetic nanoparticles in targeted drug delivery systems is under investigation by several research groups. Therapeutic drug molecules have been immobilized on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles or nanocrystals and directed to a specific target tissue using a magnetic field gradient. The drug is released by applying a radio frequency (RF) pulse. Gold coated iron, nickel and cobalt ferromagnetic nanoparticles have been employed in this  tag and drag  approach. In hypothermal treatment, magnetic nanoparticles are directed to diseased tissue containing heat sensitive tumours. An ac magnetic field is applied such that the nanoparticles become heated, causing destruction of the cancerous cells. More effective radiation therapy for tumour treatment can also be expected using metallic nanoparticles instead of, for example, magnetite. The nanoparticles allow the application of higher dosages of radiation at the tumour while sparing normal tissue. Numerous other potential applications exist in the medical and pharmaceutical field for nanomaterials from Strem. Areas currently under investigation include gene therapy, antibacterial/antimicrobial agents for burn and wound dressings, repair of damaged retinas, artificial tissues, prosthetics, enhancing signals for magnetic resonance imaging examinations, and as radio frequency controlled switching of complex biochemical processes.","Published: May 16, 2016"

Lenvima was designated as a Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA and also received a Priority Review, with approval obtained approximately six months after application submission. The approval was based on a Phase II clinical study (Study 205)1 that compared the safety and efficacy of Lenvima alone, and in combination with everolimus, in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy. From the results of the study, the group who received the combination of Lenvima plus everolimus demonstrated a significant extension in PFS, the study's primary endpoint, as well as a higher objective response rate compared to the everolimus alone group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the lenvatinib plus everolimus group were diarrhea, decreased appetite and fatigue. The most common TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher were diarrhea, hypertension and fatigue. The number of patients with kidney cancer in the United States is estimated to be approximately 58,000,2 and renal cell carcinoma comprises more than 90% of all malignancies of the kidney.3 For advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that is difficult to treat with surgery, the standard treatment is molecular targeted drug therapy, however with low 5-year survival rates, this is a disease with significant unmet medical need. Lenvima was first approved for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in the United States in February 2015, and has since been approved for thyroid cancer in over 40 countries including Japan, in Europe, South Korea and Canada. A new drug application seeking approval for an indication covering advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma submitted in Europe in January 2016 is under review, and Eisai intends to discuss further steps regarding submission strategies for this potential indication with the regulatory authorities in Japan as well. Furthermore, Eisai is conducting clinical studies of Lenvima in several other tumor types including a Phase III study of the agent in hepatocellular carcinoma. Through this additional approval, Eisai is committed to maximizing the clinical value as well as exploring the potential clinical benefits of Lenvima in order to address the diverse needs of, and further contribute to, patients with cancer and their families.

No imaging method for observing molecular movement in such detail and speed had been available, until now. A team of biochemists and physicists, led by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Imperial College London, have documented for the first time the fundamental processes of a chemical reaction unfolding in real time. They captured images - 25 trillion per second - of a tiny crystalized protein as it reacted to light. This allowed them build up a picture of what the protein was doing every few femtoseconds   quadrillionths of a second. The results are published today in the journal Science. Previously, scientists had relied on a method called X-ray crystallography, which could only take a static image of a protein. Now, they have been able to build up a series of crystallographic snapshots into a molecular movie over extremely short timescales. Study co-author Dr Jasper van Thor from Imperial s Department of Life Sciences said:  Usually, we can only image the structure after the reaction, and infer what has happened. This is the first time we have been able to image crystal structures on timescales where the proteins are still undergoing the reaction.  What happens during these timescales determines the outcome of the reaction, so knowing exactly what s going on is vital. Previously our information and images of how the reactions work have been based on theory and spectroscopy. Now we can see it in reality.  RESPONDING TO LIGHT The team studied a yellow dye molecule at the centre of a light-sensitive protein that undergoes a shape shift as it interacts with a photon, a particle of light. The basic biological process they observed is similar to how the human eye s retina responds to light. Using the Linac Coherent Light Source X-ray Free Electron Laser in California, the team fired intensely bright pulses at the protein, snapping images every few femtoseconds as the photon reaction progressed. Crucially, the result was enabled by careful tailoring of the visible light pulse, which is necessary with very bright and very brief pulses. Dr van Thor said:  We are working in interesting regimes that are new to crystallography, where the properties of the visible pulse matter most.  Next, the researchers will work on getting femtosecond details in order to actively control the dynamics. This could ultimately allow scientists to intervene in the process of protein functions by using light. CHEMISTRY FOR ALL LIFE Now that the technique has been proven to work, the team hope it will start to be applied across molecular biology to unravel the mechanisms of all of proteins  crucial reactions for life.  This puts us dramatically closer to understanding the chemistry necessary for all life,  said Marius Schmidt, physics professor at UW-Milwaukee and co-author of the paper.  Discovering the step-by-step process of how proteins function is necessary not only to inform treatment of disease, but also to shed light on the grand questions of biology.

This technology is sensitive to vibrations in the chemical bonds of the serum sample s molecules and requires minimal sample preparation, making it a rapid diagnostic alternative.  We found that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is an effective tool for detecting colitis in the serum of mice,  said Unil Perera, a Regents  Professor of Physics and researcher in the Center for Nano-Optics at Georgia State.  This rapid, simple, cost-effective and minimally invasive technique could be further developed into a personalized diagnostic tool that would assess disease status based on an individual s molecular composition and allow for personalized diagnosis and drug management. Perhaps this technology could be integrated into a portable device, such as the glucometer used by patients with diabetes.  Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease, involve chronic inflammation of all or part of the digestive tract and can lead to life-threatening complications such as colorectal cancer. Assessing this inflammation remains a challenge, and clinical diagnosis is now achieved by colonoscopy, which uses an endoscope or flexible tube with a light and camera attached to examine the digestive tract. This technique is not ideal for an annual checkup or monitoring disease activity regularly because it s expensive, invasive and requires sedation. As a result,  there is a need for a simple, inexpensive and low-risk diagnostic tool for inflammatory bowel diseases,  said Didier Merlin, professor in the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State and a researcher at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  Infrared spectroscopy has greatly enhanced clinical medicine in the last two decades and shows promise as a solution.  In the study, mice in two categories were tested for colitis using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The first group was mice with targeted deletion of the interleukin 10 (IL10) gene, known as interleukin 10 knockout (IL10-/-) mice, which develop colitis through T helper immune cells. Disease in IL10-/- mice closely resembles the physiological, histological and biochemical features of chronic colitis in humans. In the second group of mice, colitis was induced by administering Dextran Sodium Sulphate. Colitis in these mice is similar to ulcerative colitis in humans. In both groups, feces and blood samples were collected and tested. Mice in control groups were also tested. The researchers found ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is an effective tool for detecting colitis in mice serum, showing a significant increase in the levels of mannose, an indicator of colitis.

Now, a study published in Science by researchers at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (McGill University) and the University of Bern provides evidence that REM sleep does, indeed, play this role at least in mice. See Also: How brain waves guide memory formation ""We already knew that newly acquired information is stored into different types of memories, spatial or emotional, before being consolidated or integrated,"" says Sylvain Williams, a researcher and professor of psychiatry at McGill. ""How the brain performs this process has remained unclear until now. We were able to prove for the first time that REM sleep is indeed critical for normal spatial memory formation in mice,"" explains Williams, whose team is also part of the CIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-l' le-de-Montr al research network. Williams co-authored the study with Antoine Adamantidis, a researcher at the University of Bern's Department of Clinical Research and at the Sleep Wake Epilepsy Center of the Bern University Hospital. Hundreds of previous studies have tried unsuccessfully to isolate neural activity during REM sleep using traditional experimental methods. In this new study, the researchers used optogenetics to precisely target a population of neurons and control its activity by light. ""We chose to target neurons that regulate the activity of the hippocampus, a structure that is critical for memory formation during wakefulness and is known as the 'GPS system' of the brain,"" Williams says. To test the long-term spatial memory of mice, the scientists trained the rodents to spot a new object placed in a controlled environment where two objects of similar shape and volume stand. Spontaneously, mice spend more time exploring a novel object than a familiar one, showing their use of learning and recall. When these mice were in REM sleep, however, the researchers used light pulses to turn off their memory-associated neurons to determine if it affects their memory consolidation. The next day, the same rodents did not succeed the spatial memory task learned on the previous day. Compared to the control group, their memory seemed erased, or at least impaired. Learn More: Manipulating memory with light, researchers erase specific memories in mice ""Silencing the same neurons for similar durations outside REM episodes had no effect on memory. This indicates that neuronal activity specifically during REM sleep is required for normal memory consolidation,"" says the study's lead author Richard Boyce, a PhD student who, ironically, often stayed up all night while performing the experiments. REM sleep is understood to be a critical component of sleep in all mammals, including humans. Poor sleep-quality is increasingly associated with the onset of various brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In particular, REM sleep is often significantly perturbed in Alzheimer's diseases, and results from this study suggest that disruption of REM sleep may contribute directly to memory impairments observed in Alzheimer's, the researchers say.

The research, published in the journal Diabetes Care, revealed that although babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes had no differences in body fat content at birth, by two months old they had 16 per cent more body fat compared to those born to healthy mothers. Most of the babies in the study were breast-fed. The reasons behind the differences are unknown, but possible explanations include changes in the baby's metabolism while in the womb - or even differences in the composition of breast milk in mothers with gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes affects around one in 20 pregnant women in the UK (and nearly one in ten in the US) and results in a woman's blood sugar levels becoming too high. The condition, which can be controlled with diet, exercise and medication, usually starts when the woman is around seven months pregnant. Typically, it resolves soon after giving birth - though the woman may be at elevated risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. This is the first study to show the condition causes such early changes in the baby, despite no differences at birth, explains Dr Karen Logan, lead author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial: ""Gestational diabetes is becoming more and more common, and babies born to these mothers are at increased risk of developing diabetes when they grow up. Therefore we need to understand what effects maternal diabetes has on the baby. ""This new study suggests diabetes in the mother can trigger changes in the baby at a very early stage."" One of the main causes of gestational diabetes is thought to be excess weight, though other factors play a role, explains Dr Logan. ""Many of the women in our study were not overweight, and there are other possible causes of the condition, such as genetic predisposition."" She added: ""All of the women in the study had their condition well-controlled, however this study suggests that even good treatment during pregnancy may not be enough to prevent longer term problems in the baby."" The reasons behind the difference in body fat is unknown, but theories include changes in the baby while still in the womb that trigger increased fat storage once born, alterations in the mother's breast milk, or differences in the control of appetite in the baby. Professor Neena Modi, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial and senior author of the paper explained: ""The majority of babies in our study were breast fed, and previous studies have suggested that diabetes may cause changes in breast milk - so that it contains more sugar, fat or different levels of compounds that control appetite, called hunger hormones."" The study, which was conducted at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, also tracked the weight of the babies. Although babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes were found to weigh slightly less at birth, both groups of babies had a similar weight at ten weeks old. Dr Logan said the team's next project will involve analysing the composition of breast milk from mothers with gestational diabetes. It is also unclear at this stage whether pre-existing diabetes in the mother has similar effects to gestational diabetes. She added that if parents have concerns about their child's diet or weight they should speak to their health visitor or GP. In the current study, which was funded by the charity Action Medical Research, the scientists scanned 42 babies whose mothers were diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and 44 babies born to mothers without the condition, as a healthy control group. The research team asked the mothers to feed the babies, and once they were asleep they were given mini ear muffs and placed in a special moulded beanbag, before going into the MRI scanner. Dr Logan explained: ""Most of the babies slept soundly during the scan, which took around 20 minutes - possibly because they found the background noise comforting. If they woke and started crying we immediately took them out of the scanner so the mum could resettle them - however this happened very rarely. The MRI technology itself is very safe - it uses no radiation and has been used extensively in previous research studies."" Lucinda Winckworth, whose son James (pictured) was in the control group of the study added: ""Before James went into the scanner he was breastfed, wrapped up in a warm blanket, and had mini ear muffs placed over his ears. He fell asleep before going into the scanner, and even though I'd been warned the scanner was noisy he slept all the way through it - and all the way home! It was fascinating for us to see his scan pictures - we've kept them in his memory box, along with his ear muffs.""","Published: May 14, 2016"

Fruquintinib is a highly selective small molecule drug candidate that has been shown to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 24 hours a day via an oral dose, without known off-target toxicities. The FRESCO trial is evaluating the efficacy of fruquintinib versus placebo, with all patients receiving best supportive care ( BSC ). The primary endpoint is overall survival ( OS ).  Completing enrollment of our first Phase III clinical trial is an important milestone for our company,  said Christian Hogg, Chief Executive Officer of Chi-Med.  We believe fruquintinib has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in several types of solid tumors. While we wait for the FRESCO CRC data to mature over the balance of the year, we are focused on accelerating the ongoing Phase III FALUCA pivotal trial in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), and launching additional studies of fruquintinib, including a Phase II study in gastric cancer in combination with paclitaxel, new studies in the U.S., and certain exploratory studies in combination with other oncology agents.  The FRESCO trial was launched following a 71-patient, randomized, double-blind Phase II trial of fruquintinib as a third-line treatment for metastatic CRC. The study met its primary endpoint of progression free survival ( PFS ) of 4.73 months for patients receiving fruquintinib versus 0.99 month for the placebo arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (p<0.001), and had no unexpected safety issues. The positive data resulted in a US$18 million payment to Chi-Med from its partner, Eli Lilly and Company ( Lilly ).","Published: May 14, 2016"

The system has been interfaced with a nanoindentation system from Hysitron Inc., Minneapolis, USA, to provide combined chemical and mechanical information on samples. Professor Virginia (Ginger) Ferguson is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado who focuses on the mechanical behaviour, and underlying materials science, of biological tissues and biomaterials. Her group investigates the local mechanical properties of materials that are biological, biomimetic or used in biological tissue replacement (e.g. for tissue repair and regeneration), correlating these properties with chemical and structural information obtained from Raman and other techniques. More specifically, Professor Ferguson's research emphasises: the experimental study and finite element modelling of native osteochondral (bone-cartilage) tissues and of materials for osteochondral tissue regeneration; bone tissue properties in mouse models that are affected by unloading and microgravity, aging, and/or metabolic disease (e.g. kidney disease); and tissues involved in successful pregnancy outcomes in humans (e.g., the cervix and chorioamnion-the  amniotic sac ). The group has developed protocols and analytical solutions to collect and evaluate nanomechanical property measurements of bone, calcified cartilage and soft tissues (e.g. cartilage). They also evaluate collagen fibril orientation and alignment using secondary harmonic generation imaging and evaluate mineral volume fraction in mineralized tissues using quantitative backscattered electron imaging. The team collaborates with other groups to test materials for a wide range of engineering applications including materials for batteries/energy storage, microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices, advanced polymers and other complex material systems which makes it a varied and interesting laboratory to work in. Pairing Renishaw's inVia  Raman microscope with the TriboIndenter from Hysitron results in a combined instrument that provides a greatly enhanced characterisation capability complementing existing spectroscopies. Professor Ferguson said,  This unique system provides the capability to investigate mechanical properties and mechanical behaviours in parallel with imaging the chemical constituents within the materials being tested at exactly matched sites / locations with ~1  m resolution. We use the information on a material's chemistry to elucidate changes in mechanical properties or to explain mechanical properties within single sites or when mapping over 2D regions. Moreover, mapping reveals gradients or heterogeneity of material chemistry and crystal structure. We can also uniquely evaluate chemical changes that occur following pressure induced phase transformations (that could be applied by nanoindentation, for example).  Professor Ferguson continued,  The inVia offers a degree of customization that is not available on other systems. More importantly, we like the manner in which the inVia collects Raman spectra compared to other systems. We are the first to have joined the Hysitron nanoindenter with any Raman spectroscopy tool and have had technical challenges to overcome. I have been exceptionally pleased with the level of customer support we have received from Renishaw during the development of our unique combined instrument. Renishaw has been fantastic to work with.

Exposing seeds to ionizing radiation allows scientists to control the growth and development of plants, from the early stages through to harvest. There are different types of irradiation, including plasma irradiation   a technique that does not damage the plants but has been shown to increase seed germination rates and overall plant length. Now, Kazunori Koga and co-workers at Kyushu University have demonstrated that the use of  non-thermal air plasma irradiation  can dramatically improve the harvest of the salad crop Arabidopsis thaliana1. The team built a scalable device to generate the non-thermal plasma, and placed 20 A. thaliana seeds under the device before subjecting them to a three minute dose of plasma radiation. The seeds were then planted and their growth and proliferation monitored and compared with a control group. The researchers found that the germination rate for the plasma seeds was almost a full day faster than the controls. The plasma plants reached maturity at 17.5 days, compared with 22 days for the control group. The seeds produced by the plasma group were larger, with a 39% overall increase in seed number. The results represent an 11% shorter harvest period and a 56% increase in total seed weight; a significant improvement in crop yield. Koga s team are hopeful their non-thermal plasma method represents an environmentally-friendly way of maximizing A. thaliana yields and potentially those of other crop types.","Published: May 14, 2016"

The data were collected a year after the soldiers returned home. The results suggest that deployment to these conflicts could trigger symptoms consistent with CMI. See Also: Study identifies two genes that boost risk for PTSD The ailment presents as a combination of medically unexplained chronic symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, joint pain, indigestion, insomnia, dizziness, breathing problems, and memory problems. The study, by researchers with VA's War-Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) in New Jersey, appears in the Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development. ""As a whole, CMI can be challenging to evaluate and manage,"" said lead author Dr. Lisa McAndrew. ""CMI is distinct from PTSD or depression. It contributes to significant disability."" McAndrew is also with the University at Albany. In the veteran community, chronic multisymptom illness has previously been associated mainly with service during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s. At least a quarter of those veterans are affected. Experts aren't sure, though, if that condition is the same one that has emerged among more recent veterans, as documented in the newest WRIISC study and one or two earlier ones. Last year, for example, researchers with the Millennium Cohort Study reported that about a third of combat veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan had CMI symptoms. ""This condition appears to be similar to that experienced by many Gulf War veterans, in terms of the symptoms, but we don't really know if it's the same condition,"" says McAndrew. ""That still requires study."" McAndrew and her colleagues surveyed 319 soldiers about their overall health before they deployed and one year after they returned. The VA team found there were 150 soldiers who did not report many symptoms before they deployed but who reported symptoms of CMI one year after deployment, suggesting a link between deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and CMI. In total, nearly 50 percent of the overall group met the criteria for mild to moderate CMI, and about 11 percent met the criteria for severe CMI, one year after deployment. The most common symptoms reported were trouble sleeping, moodiness or irritability, joint pain, fatigue, difficulty remembering or concentrating, headaches, and sinus congestion. Learn More: Common anesthetic procedure dramatically improves well being of veterans with PTSD Not surprisingly, the researchers found that veterans who screened positive for CMI scored significantly lower on measures of physical and mental health function. Of the 319 veterans in the study, 166 had chronic pain, lasting more than three months. Almost all of those with chronic pain 90 percent also met the criteria for CMI. Similarly, 82 percent of those with CMI reported chronic pain. The finding underscores the strong link between chronic pain and CMI, say the researchers. The study also found that almost all veterans with PTSD symptoms also showed signs of CMI about 98 percent. Only seven patients had PTSD and did not meet the criteria for CMI. In contrast, though, about 44 percent of the veterans with CMI did not have PTSD. In other words, the link between PTSD and CMI was not as robust as that between chronic pain and CMI. The authors caution that the study looked only at pain and PTSD as factors tied in with CMI. It did not document other conditions that could possibly account for the symptoms of CMI, such as depression, traumatic brain injury, and substance abuse. At the same time, they say these other conditions are unlikely to completely account for the frequency of symptoms seen in the study. By the same token, other conditions not examined in the study, such as arthritis or multiple sclerosis, could cause symptoms similar to those of CMI. More research is needed to tease out those variables. Another limitation of the study: The research team used a definition of CMI, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that is based on Gulf War Veterans. They say it might not exactly fit the symptoms of veterans of the more recent conflicts. Also, it's unclear whether the Guard and Reserve members surveyed in the study are representative of the larger veteran or military cohort who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. All in all, the research team advises that the results be interpreted with caution. ""We're taking the approach that an abundance of caution is necessary in the clinical implications of the findings,"" says McAndrew. ""Respondents self-reported symptoms on pen and paper surveys. The symptoms were not confirmed or evaluated by a clinician. While the CDC case definition is fairly clear-cut, in clinical practice there is a lot of gray area around applying the label of CMI. We used the term 'symptoms consistent with CMI' to indicate the uncertainty due to the self-reported, clinician-unverified nature of the classification."" Pending further research on the topic, McAndrew's group says clinicians in VA or other settings should consider CMI when evaluating Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans, especially those with chronic pain. Once the condition is identified, clinicians in VA and the Department of Defense do have a clinical practice guideline for managing the condition. Don't Miss: Trauma experiences change the brain even in those without PTSD ""Acknowledging the presence of multiple symptoms and taking a holistic approach to achieving patient goals is critical in managing CMI,"" says McAndrew. For example, pain management may need to be tailored to account for other symptoms of CMI. The WRIISC study notwithstanding, McAndrew says not enough attention has been focused on the issue to date. ""There have been few studies of CMI among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Our findings suggest this could be an overlooked problem."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

New research suggests the same brain areas may be involved in both detecting threats posed by animals and evaluating other humans' intentions. The study, published in the May 11 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience, offers insight into a basic feature of human cognition: how we understand and evaluate other creatures. ""The idea that animals may be processed in a similar way [to humans] and may piggyback on regions of the brain that have been implicated in social cognition suggests that those regions ... are multipurpose,"" said study author Andrew Connolly of Dartmouth College. Learn More: The social origins of intelligence in the brain Previously Connolly's research group found that hierarchical classes of animals (say, bugs vs. mammals) are represented in an area of the brain called the lateral occipital complex, a region involved in object perception and recognition. What was not known, however, was which brain regions process information about an animal's ""dangerousness."" To investigate this, the researchers scanned volunteers' brains while they viewed pictures of bugs, reptiles, and mammals. Half of the animals depicted were classified as ""low threat,"" such as butterflies and rabbits, and half were ""high threat,"" such as snakes and cougars. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers determined which areas of the brain were active when participants viewed bugs, reptiles, and mammals, and when they viewed low- and high-threat animals. Researchers used these activity patterns to map how two kinds of information -- taxonomic class and threat -- are encoded in the brain. As before, they found taxonomic class was represented in the lateral occipital complex. Surprisingly, a different area of the brain represented threat. This area, called the superior temporal sulcus, is a fold in brain tissue running just above the ear, and previous research has implicated the region in understanding facial expressions and deciphering others' intentions. The researchers speculate that evaluating other humans and evaluating threats posed by animals may be related functions. See Also: Babies have logical reasoning before age one, study finds Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge who studies visual object recognition and was not involved in the study, said this is interesting basic science. ""Knowing what parts of the brain are involved in social cognition and how information processing works is relevant to our understanding of human brains, minds, and cultures."" The researchers are planning future studies to examine how activity in these brain networks changes over time. The present study used fMRI, which measures changes in blood flow as a proxy of neural activity, a measure that is slow and inadequate for understanding temporal relationships.

Adrian Raine, the Richard Perry University Professor of Criminology, Psychology and Psychiatry, has spent his career looking at how the brain's biological functioning affects antisocial behavior. He focuses specifically on understanding these actions and learning how to modify them, whether with something benign like a child acting out or with something extreme, in the case of a homicidal killer. See Also: Aggression causes new nerve cells to be generated in the brain ""How do you change the brain to make people better?"" he asked. ""How can we improve brain functioning to improve behavior?"" These questions formed the foundation for work Raine had previously done with adolescents on the African island of Mauritius. In a randomized control trial, one group received omega-3 supplements for six months, the other didn't. Those taking the fish oil saw a reduction in aggressive and antisocial behavior. ""That was my starting point,"" he said. ""I was really excited about the results we published there."" Mauritius, however, is a tropical climate and a different culture from the United States, so Raine, a Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor, decided to test a new version of the study in Philadelphia, to aim for more broadly applicable outcomes. He partnered with Therese Richmond, the Andrea B. Laporte Professor of Nursing and associate dean for research and innovation, and several other Penn faculty, including Rose Cheney of the Perelman School of Medicine and Jill Portnoy of the Criminology Department in the School of Arts & Sciences. The Philadelphia randomized control study placed 290 11- and 12-year-olds with a history of violence into four groups: The first received omega-3 in the form of juice, as well as multivitamins and calcium for three months. For that same duration, a second group participated in cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, which included meeting weekly for an hour, with time split between the child, the parent and with both together. Learn More: Does sexual aggression alter the female brain?""Sessions focused on the links between thoughts, feelings and behaviors and also practicing alternative actions the children could take to deal with difficult situations rather than to emotionally react to something,"" said Richmond, who supervised the clinical trial. ""It's helping the child build a toolbox of ways to interact with others. For example, if I'm angry, how might I cope with anger other than physically striking out?""All participants got homework, too. A third group in the study took the supplements and participated in CBT, and a fourth received resources and information targeted at reducing aggressive behavior. Blood samples at the experiment's start and conclusion measured omega-3 levels in each child. ""Immediately after three months of the nutritional intervention rich in omega-3s, we found a decrease in the children's reporting of their aggressive behavior,"" Richmond said. The team also followed up three and six months later. At the first check-in, participants getting the combination of CBT and omega-3s reported less aggression than the control group and the therapy-only group. By the final check-in, however, any positive effects had dissipated. What remains unknown is whether continued use of omega-3s would lead to a long-term reduction in antisocial behavior. There were other minor limitations to the research. For one, self-reporting completed by parents and children didn't line up. The 11- and 12-year-olds in the omega-3 and CBT-supplement groups noted fewer aggressive behaviors; their parents said such tendencies hadn't changed. Also, some participants dropped out before the study had finished. Despite these challenges, Raine, Richmond and their colleagues said the findings provide some important insight. Don't Miss: Origins of  rage  identified in brain in male animal model ""No matter what program you use, could adding omega-3s to your treatment help?"" Raine asked. ""This suggests it could."" And though the work answers some questions, it also creates new ones, which returns to a larger point regarding the mind-action connection: It's complicated. ""We can't oversimplify the complexity of antisocial behavior. There are many causes,"" Raine said. ""It's not just the brain. Is it a piece of the jigsaw puzzle? I think it is.""

Psychologists from the University of Basel together with international colleagues report that certain epigenetic adaptations in newborns suggest this conclusion. Their results have been published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. See Also: No long term effects of antidepressant use during pregnancy, but risk of significant blood loss during childbirth is increased In their study, the researchers observed that increased concentrations of maternal stress hormones, depressive symptoms and general adversities during pregnancy were accompanied by epigenetic changes in the child. As a result of these changes the oxytocin receptor gene, which is important for social behavior and stress adaptations, is activated more easily. This mechanism could indicate that in these cases, the babies adapt to develop more resilience to cope with future challenges and adversities. Whether a gene can be activated or not also depends on methyl groups that attach to the DNA and function as a switch. The researchers found that children from mothers with increased stress and depressive symptoms show a reduced methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene at birth. This results in the gene becoming more easily activated, which leads to a facilitated production of oxytocin receptors for oxytocin to react with and unfold its effects. Oxytocin not only has an important function in mother-child bonding and in induction of labor and lactation, it also influences social behavior. For their study, the team of Prof. Gunther Meinlschmidt from the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Basel examined 100 mothers and their babies during and after pregnancy. They collected umbilical cord blood from 39 newborns and assessed the stress hormone cortisol in saliva samples of the mothers. In addition, the researchers evaluated stressful life events and mental health of the mothers via questionnaires. Since the data were only analyzed up to the newborn phase, no conclusions were drawn with regard to the long-term consequences that the epigenetic programming of oxytocin receptors might have for the children. Researchers from the University of Basel, Ruhr University Bochum, Exeter University, McGill University Montreal, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, University of Trier, Zurich University of Applied Sciences and the Stress Center Trier were involved in this study funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Previous studies have shown, that adversities during pregnancy can increase the risk for mental disorders and physical diseases in the mother's offspring.

A team of researchers from the University of Houston (UH) and the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) focused on all three of these important factors. See Also: How the brain pays attention: Identifying regions of the brain dealing with object-based, spatial attention Led by Ioannis Pavlidis from UH and Robert Wunderlich of TTI, the research studied how drivers behave when they are absent minded, emotionally charged or engaged in texting. The work was funded, in part, by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program. (The conclusions being expressed are the authors' only and have not been sponsored, approved or endorsed by Toyota or Plaintiffs' Class Counsel). The study looked at 59 volunteers who were asked to drive the same segment of highway four times - under 'normal conditions' of being focused on driving, while distracted with cognitively challenging questions, while distracted with emotionally charged questions and while preoccupied with texting trivialities. To avoid bias, the order of the drives was randomized. In all three interventions absent minded, emotional and texting the researchers found that the drivers' handling of the wheel became jittery with respect to normal driving. This jittery handling resulted in significant lane deviations and unsafe driving only in the case of texting distractions. In the case of absent-minded and emotionally charged distractions, jittery steering resulted in straighter trajectories with respect to a normal drive and safer driving. Ioannis Pavlidis, a computer science professor at the University of Houston, measures a test subject's perinasal perspiration in his Computational Physiology Lab. Credit: Jessie Villarreal  ""A likely explanation for this paradox is the function performed by a part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC,"" Pavlidis said. ""ACC is known to automatically intervene as an error corrector when there is conflict. In this case, the conflict comes from the cognitive, emotional and sensorimotor, or texting, stressors. This raises the levels of physiological stress, funneling 'fight or flight' energy to the driver's arms, resulting in jittery handling of the steering wheel."" What happens when the brain's ACC automatically intervenes, Pavlidis said, is that it counterbalances any strong jitter to the left with an instant equally strong jitter to the right and vice versa. The end effect of this forceful action is nullification of any veering to the left or the right of the lane and, thus, very straight driving. For ACC to perform this corrective function, it needs support from the driver's eye-hand coordination loop. If this loop breaks, which it does when the driver texts, then ACC fails and the jittery handling of the steering wheel is left unchecked, resulting in a significant lane deviation and possible accident. ""The driver's mind can wander and his or her feelings may boil, but a sixth sense keeps a person safe at least in terms of veering off course,"" Pavlidis said. ""What makes texting so dangerous is that it wreaks havoc into this sixth sense. Self-driving cars may bypass this and other problems, but the moral of the story is that humans have their own auto systems that work wonders, until they break."" Learn More: Brain network that controls, redirects attention identified Pavlidis and Wunderlich think the scientific and manufacturing community can benefit from their team's study. They posit that the question of what happens when self-driving cars experience failures needs to be asked now rather than later. Case in point, their research uncovers the mechanism that makes moderate cognitive and emotional distractions relatively safe, but only as long as the driver's natural tendency to handle multiple tasks is not overwhelmed. ""Following up on the results of our science study, we are currently looking into the development of a car system to monitor outward driving behaviors, such as steering jitter or lane deviation, as well as the internal state of the driver that causes them,"" Pavlidis said. ""This system, which I call 'stressalyzer,' a play on the word breathalyzer, may serve not only as a 'black box' in car accidents, but also as a driver alert and prevention mechanism, since it will continuously sense a driver drifting to distracted mode.""

The company's most advanced programme is a universal vaccine to improve the protection provided by the seasonal flu vaccination for the over-65s. Vaccitech is also developing a clinical stage therapeutic vaccine for prostate cancer, and a number of additional preclinical programs. Currently, no single vaccine can give immunity against even a majority of circulating flu virus strains. Instead, flu vaccines are manufactured in advance of each flu season using complex forecasting, based on data from the preceding year. However, predicting flu strains is difficult. For instance, records from the US Centre for Disease Control show that in 2013/14 the rate of protection dipped as low as 3.4%. Each year seasonal outbreaks of flu cause three to five million cases of severe disease and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide. Young children and the elderly are particularly at risk. The Jenner Institute team is led by Professors Adrian Hill and Sarah Gilbert. Professor Gilbert said: 'Clinical trials of the universal vaccine here in Oxford have shown great promise. The vaccine has proved safe and shown good clinical responses, including enhanced protection against the flu detectable in older adults even one year after vaccination. It has performed well when given with the standard flu vaccine. 'We are planning a Phase IIb, 1,500-patient trial scheduled to begin later in 2016, the next step towards regulatory approval. 'To create a vaccine which works against every flu virus, we've targeted two proteins inside the virus which do not change, even as the virus mutates the proteins on its surface. This also means the vaccine should work against all human, avian and swine influenza strains.' Vaccitech will also be developing a therapeutic cancer vaccine, initially targeting prostate cancer. Professor Hill said: 'New ""checkpoint inhibitor"" cancer therapies are proving highly effective at taking the physiological ""brakes"" off the immune system's ability to identify and fight tumour cells. It is now widely acknowledged that combining current therapies with a vaccine element to focus the immune response on key cancer antigens will increase the success of cancer immunotherapies. 'Vaccitech's vaccine stimulates the body to mount an immune attack against a unique tumour-specific protein found on the most common types of solid cancer including prostate, renal, colorectal and lung cancers.' A Phase I/II study to assess safety and efficacy of this vaccine in men with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer is under way and recruiting subjects in Oxford and other centres.

OxStem plans to develop small molecule drugs that can activate repair mechanisms that already exist within the body. Building on decades of experience in medicinal chemistry, OxStem will design drugs that can programme resident stem and stem-like cells in situ to treat currently untreatable age-related conditions. In essence, OxStem seeks to switch on the body's natural regeneration and repair systems. Current stem cell treatments mostly focus on injection of cells into the body and are available only in hospitals with access to the specialist laboratory facilities needed to harvest, isolate and multiply stem cells. OxStem plans to reprogram stem and stem-like progenitor cells that already exist in the body with no need for cell transplantation procedures. This will be the sixth spinout for OxStem co-founder Professor Steve Davies from Oxford's Department of Chemistry. Co-founders Professor Dame Kay Davies and Professor Angela Russell are also serial entrepreneurs with a number of drug-development spinouts to their names. Professor Steve Davies said: 'We will identify small molecule drug candidates, which can program adult stem and stem-like cells to repair and replace tissues affected by disease or injury. We are tackling many of the worst conditions associated with ageing: dementia, heart failure, cancer and macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world.' He added: 'We have been very fortunate in being able to collaborate with some 80 University colleagues, all leaders in their respective fields, to match our insights and skills with their domain expertise to innovate clinical models and potential therapies. This is Oxford science at its best.' The funding will be used primarily for the development of pre-clinical small molecule drug candidates. 'By developing drugs for this purpose we have the potential to revolutionise healthcare,' said OxStem Chairman and CEO Dr Michael Stein. 'Our talented team is now going to be supported by a highly sophisticated investor base.' Dr Stein added: 'Our company is extremely fortunate to have the strategic backing of Human Longevity Inc (HLI) and CEO Dr J Craig Venter, along with the team of Mr Bob Duggan and Dr Makham Zanganeh (former CEO and Chairman, and Chief Operating Officer respectively) of Pharmacyclics that was sold last year to Abbvie for US$21 billion. Our other investors include a number of UK and international individuals as well as Oxford Sciences Innovation. What is common to all our investors is that they are all driven by the desire to support OxStem's world-class medicinal science capabilities in its mission to positively impact millions of lives.' The company's scientific advisory board, which is chaired by Professor Dame Kay Davies, will include Dr Venter, who is best known for his seminal genomic sequencing work including sequencing the first human genome. Commenting on HLI's involvement with OxStem, Dr Venter said: 'Professor Steve Davies and his team are true visionaries in this field and have world-class chemistry capabilities. HLI is eager to work with OxStem to jointly discover new classes of stem-cell based therapies to help enable a true era of personalised medicine.' Oxford's Isis Innovation supported the company in preparing the spinout and commercialising the technology. Dr Carolyn Porter, Deputy Head of Technology Transfer (Pharma and Biotech) at Isis Innovation said: 'This  16.9m funding   a record for a UK academic spinout   speaks to the enormous promise of OxStem.' OxStem will fund the development of a series of daughter companies   each with a focus on a different large unmet therapeutic need. The first of these companies is OxStem Oncology, which will investigate the potential for intervening in therapy-resistant cancers. The team will focus initially on acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes with a view to expanding to other conditions over time. Plans are well advanced for the subsequent launch of OxStem Cardio, OxStem Neuro and OxStem Ocular to apply the stem cell technology to developing therapies for cardiac failure, neurodegenerative diseases, and macular degeneration.","Published: May 13, 2016"

Scientists from the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) of the University of Luxembourg in collaboration with colleagues at the Luxembourg Institute of Health and the University of Arizona in the United States have now proven that a model of the human gut they have developed and patented   HuMiX, the  Human Microbial Cross-talk  model   is representative of the actual conditions and processes that occur within our intestines. With HuMiX, the researchers can analyse the complex interactions between human cells and bacteria, predict their effects on health or disease onset, and study the action of probiotics and drugs. The researchers publish their findings in the journal Nature Communications (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11535). Portrayal of the processes in the human gut In HuMiX, the  Human Microbial Cross-talk  model, human intestinal cells and bacteria can be cultivated together in a very small space under representative conditions. The apparatus, no bigger than a beer mat, consists of three chambers. The top chamber is the supply level, from which nutrients continuously flow down to the cell cultures below. Human cells grow on a very thin membrane in the middle chamber, while bacteria grow in the lowest chamber.  With HuMiX, we can observe interaction of bacteria in real-time as they communicate with human intestinal cells,  says Prof. Paul Wilmes, head of the LCSB Eco-Systems Biology Group and inventor of HuMiX. For their tests confirming the validity of HuMiX experiments, the researchers employed pure cultures of various bacterial strains.  Using cutting-edge analytical methods established at the LCSB, we then studied how the gene activity and metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells change depending on the bacterial strain used in HuMiX,  Wilmes explains.  A comparison of our data with results from other research groups who obtained theirs from humans or animals showed strong agreement.  That means HuMiX delivers a very accurate portrayal of the cellular and molecular processes taking place in the human gut.  With HuMiX we can also study processes so far inaccessible by existing experimental methods,  Wilmes adds. Dr Pranjul Shah, first author of the publication and co-inventor of the HuMiX device, names one example of a metabolic process the LCSB researchers discovered with HuMiX:  In a co-culture of intestinal cells and a certain strain of the bacterial species Lactobacillus rhamnosus, we determined that production of a messenger of the nervous system, specifically the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA, is stimulated in intestinal cells, indicating a mechanism by which the intestine may be communicating with the brain.  Scientists had already seen evidence of this effect several years earlier in the brain of mice born with a completely sterile gut (which was devoid of all intestinal flora), when their gut was inoculated with similar Lactobacillus strains. The ability of HuMiX to provide such responses can be attributed to the unique capability of the HuMiX model to allow cultivation of anaerobic bacteria along with human intestinal cells , highlights Shah. Supporting drug development  We can now study these and similar effects at an unprecedented level of precision thanks to HuMiX,  Paul Wilmes continues.  There are clues, for example, that inflammatory processes can play a role in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s. In HuMiX, we can introduce distinct bacterial species or whole communities into the artificial gut model and check whether these organisms trigger or slow down inflammation, or even introduce immune cells and neurons together with the bacteria.  In their publication, the scientists present evidence that HuMiX is a suitable tool for understanding a range of molecular processes involved in the interaction between human cells and bacteria. Furthermore, Wilmes sees a benefit not only for basic research, but also for clinical application:  With HuMiX, we can now also analyse how probiotics, dietary compounds or drugs affect human physiology. We expect to see concrete indicators of how these therapeutics need to be refined in order to work better in the future. ","Published: May 13, 2016"

The Leicester team will collaborate with organisations working in the field such as the Kenya Wildlife Service and Panthera. The method, proposed by Dr Jon Wetton from the University of Leicester s Department of Genetics, uses DNA barcode genes to identify animal species in real time. This could be used to test blood stains on the machete of a poacher, identify bushmeat from endangered animals such as chimpanzees at local markets - and even detect the frequent illegal substitution of products derived from protected species in the caviar trade. Wildlife trafficking is a global crisis - $20 billion of animal parts are illegally traded each year, fuelling criminal networks that spread insecurity, devastate species, and destroy livelihoods. The Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge, an initiative of the U.S. Agency for International Development with support from National Geographic, Smithsonian and TRAFFIC, sourced innovative science and technology solutions to combat this problem. Three hundred creators from 52 countries applied, of which 16   including the University of Leicester - have each been awarded $10,000 and an opportunity to bid for a larger award of up to $500,000 to help implement their solutions in the real wild world. The award to the University of Leicester s Dr Jon Wetton aims to combat the wildlife trafficking trade by initiating the development of a method of determining the species of origin of animal derivatives and forensic traces in the field using a portable device to read  barcode genes  - DNA sequences which vary significantly between species.  To do this the University of Leicester will use the MinION, a portable USB-powered DNA sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.  The team will also explore the use of VolTRAX, a sample preparation device designed to allow non-scientists to prepare samples outside a laboratory environment.  Together these technologies are intended to fully automate DNA analysis from applying an original sample of blood or tissue to comparing the analysis results in real time with a reference database of species-specific barcode gene sequences.  Dr Wetton from the University of Leicester Department of Genetics said:  This project builds upon research carried out in 2003 when I led the Forensic Science Service team responsible for introducing species identification by DNA into UK casework.  Our method then was costly, as it required more than a day s work in a well-equipped laboratory, but by using the MinION device we hope to achieve the same results about one hour from collecting a sample.  A cheap and rapid test will allow law enforcement officers to carry out the testing in developing countries, or allow rapid testing of goods in transit at customs posts.  The device will also reduce the inconvenience to legitimate traders and raise awareness of the extent and diversity of illegal trade.  Dr Wetton added:  We hope to demonstrate proof of concept within a year, with a view to working on it further so that the method is more broadly useful in the field. This initial grant will help demonstrate how the test could be used to detect traces of elephant and rhino blood in poaching cases once the device is fully developed. ","Published: May 13, 2016"

University of Manchester and Central Manchester University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (CMFT) researchers have developed the pioneering approach for Sanfilippo disease (also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III or MPS III)   a genetic condition for which there is currently no effective treatment. The most common of the four types of Sanfilippo (type A) affects around 100 children in the UK, or one in 89,000 births, and it is this type that is targeted by the new treatment. Sanfilippo is caused by a lack of the SGSH enzyme, which helps to break down and recycle long chain sugars. This results in a build-up of sugars in the body and particularly the brain. Children with Sanfilippo begin showing symptoms of hyperactivity, severe behavioural problems and miss developmental milestones as toddlers. As they get older they show symptoms similar to dementia, and most never achieve a mental age beyond two years. Later they will experience seizures and difficulties in walking and swallowing. It is invariably fatal, with most children dying around the age of 18 years. Following a licence agreement with Orchard Therapeutics, a new UK-based clinical-stage biotechnology company, the gene therapy developed in Manchester will be trialled in humans. The University of Manchester s technology transfer company, UMI3, negotiated the terms of the major deal with Orchard Therapeutics. Dr Brian Bigger, who leads the Stem Cell and Neurotherapies Laboratory at The University of Manchester and developed the technique in partnership with the Trust scientists, said:  This license agreement with Orchard will allow us to take the technique we have developed to the next and crucial stage of trials in humans. We are hopeful that this treatment may help to treat the early onset dementia in these patients and saving children s lives.  If we can show that it is possible to treat single gene brain diseases, such as Sanfilippo, with stem cell gene therapy, this will pave the way for treating other lysosomal storage and neuro-metabolic disorders.  The treatment works by genetically correcting the patients  own stem cells and implanting them into bone marrow to release the missing enzyme in a way that reaches the brain, thereby correcting the condition. The new study will take place at CMFT, supported by the NIHR/Wellcome Trust Manchester Clinical Research Facility.  There are currently no effective treatments available to children affected by Sanfilippo disease. We hope that this work will help to halt the progression of this devastating condition,  added Dr Simon Jones, Consultant in Paediatric Inherited Metabolic Disease at Saint Mary s Hospital and the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine. Professor Robert Wynn, Consultant Paediatric Haematologist at Royal Manchester Children s Hospital and chief investigator for the clinical study explained:  This new clinical study aims to explore whether we can use stem cell gene therapy to produce blood cells that express corrected versions of the missing enzyme. ""We know that in conditions similar to Sanfilippo blood cells from a bone marrow donor can deliver such enzymes effectively. This new gene therapy builds on the decades of experience of CMFT physicians in bone marrow transplantation of children with these other metabolic diseases.  Earlier attempts to cure the illness with a bone marrow transplant were unsuccessful as not enough enzyme was produced to have an effect, but the Manchester team has developed a way of overproducing the SGSH enzyme specifically in bone marrow white blood cells. This was achieved by developing a lentiviral vector   a tool commonly used by molecular biologists to deliver genetic material into cells   specifically for use in humans, which will be tested in the trial. The lentiviral vector delivers the SGSH gene to bone marrow cells, which, when implanted into the body are able to traffic to both the bone marrow and the brain and deliver SGSH enzyme throughout the body, thus correcting the disease. Recently a related illness metachromatic leukodystrophy has been treated by Italian scientists using a similar approach, with extremely promising results in patients. The Manchester team used a similar lentiviral vector to the Italian team, but improved the design to make it more specific to the white blood cells that traffic into and engraft in the brain after a bone marrow transplant (monocytes/microglia). This improves brain targeting and effectiveness. Professor Bobby Gaspar, Chief Scientific Officer of Orchard Therapeutics said:  Stem cell gene therapy has shown promising effects in several different diseases and we are hopeful that this technology will change the lives of children with Sanfilippo type A and other monogenic bone marrow disorders in the near future.  Life Sciences Minister, George Freeman MP, said:  This pioneering trial, led by UK researchers in partnership with a UK company, underlines exactly why we invest  1 billion each year through the National Institute for Health Research.  This new gene therapy has the potential to change the lives of children with this dreadful condition, and will undoubtedly help to cement the UK s position as a world-leader in medical research.

The simple process involves a special device that squeezes cells in a blood sample through tiny funnels, which drive the cancer cells and blood cells into separate streams based on differences in their size and softness.  Circulating tumour cells cells from a tumour that have escaped into the bloodstream with the potential to spread into other tissues are extremely useful for assessing a patient s disease in order to select the most appropriate treatment,  said UBC mechanical engineering professor Hongshen Ma, the lead researcher.  These cells are particularly important for prostate cancer, where the site of metastasis is typically in the bone, where biopsies are difficult or impossible.  Ma s research focus is microfluidics, the flow of liquids through channels smaller than a human hair. The microfluidic device designed by his team captures cells based on their distinct internal structure a mechanical analysis instead of the blood chemistry analysis used in conventional medical diagnostic techniques. The device was first tested using blood samples spiked with cancer cells. It was then used to analyze blood samples from 20 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, an advanced form of cancer, and from four healthy individuals.  In the first experiment, the device was able to capture more than 90 per cent of the cells,  noted co-author Dr. Kim N. Chi, director of clinical research at the B.C. Cancer Agency and a professor of medicine at UBC.  Importantly, in patient samples the device captured about 25 times the number of cancer cells and produced fewer false positives compared to the conventional CellSearch system, which also analyzes blood samples.  The team is currently working on genome sequencing of individual circulating tumour cells from patients at the Vancouver Prostate Centre. This would allow researchers to determine the mutations responsible for metastasis so that doctors can select the most appropriate treatment.","Published: May 13, 2016"

The find has been made by University of Warwick researchers who now hope that their discovery will be developed to provide a treatment for patients. Professor Thornalley who led research said:  This is an incredibly exciting development and could have a massive impact on our ability to treat these diseases. As well as helping to treat diabetes and heart disease it could defuse the obesity time bomb.  The research  Improved glycemic control and vascular function in overweight and obese subjects by glyoxalase 1 inducer formulation  has been published in the journal Diabetes, and received funding from the UK s innovation agency, Innovate UK. The project was a collaboration between the University of Warwick and University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust. A team led by Paul Thornalley, Professor in Systems Biology at Warwick Medical School, studied two compounds found in fruits but not usually found together. The compounds are trans-resveratrol (tRES)   found in red grapes, and hesperetin (HESP)   found in oranges. When given jointly at pharmaceutical doses the compounds acted in tandem to decrease blood glucose, improve the action of insulin and improve the health of arteries. The researchers noted an improvement in insulin resistance in trial participants produced by the compounds in eight weeks treatment that was similar to that achieved with bariatric surgery after six months. Currently Metformin is considered for the treatment of overweight/obese people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However in the study the combination of the fruit compounds was found to be more effective than Metformin at reducing blood sugar in the obese and overweight trial participants. The compounds act by increasing a protein called glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) in the body which neutralises a damaging sugar-derived compound called methylglyoxal (MG). MG is a major contributor to the damaging effects of sugar. Increased MG accumulation with a high energy diet intake is a driver of insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes, and also damages blood vessels and impairs handling of cholesterol associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Blocking MG improved health in overweight and obese people and will likely help patients with diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease too. It has already been proven experimentally that blocking MG improves health impairment in obesity and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although the same compounds are found naturally in some fruits, the amounts and type required for health improvement cannot be obtained from increased fruit consumption. The compounds that increase Glo1 and are called a  Glo1 inducer . Pharmaceutical doses for patients with obesity, diabetes and high risk of heart disease could be given to patients in capsule form. Professor Thornalley and his team increased Glo1 expression in cell culture. He then tested the formulation in a randomised, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial. Thirty-two overweight and obese people within the 18-80 age range who had a BMI between 25-40 took part in the trial. They were given the supplement in capsule form once a day for eight weeks. They were asked to maintain their usual diet and their food intake was monitored via a dietary questionnaire and they were also asked not to alter their daily physical activity. Changes to their sugar levels were assessed by blood samples, artery health measured by artery wall flexibility and other assessments by analysis of blood markers. The team found that the highly overweight subjects who had BMIs of over 27.5 with treatment displayed increased Glo1 activity, decreased glucose levels, improved working of insulin, improved artery function and decreased blood vessel inflammation. There was no effect of placebo. Professor Thornalley said:  Obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are at epidemic levels in Westernised countries. Glo1 deficiency has been identified as a driver of health problems in obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Diabetic kidney disease will be the initial target to prove effective treatment for which we are currently seeking commercial investors and partners. Our new pharmaceutical is safe and expected to be an effective add-on treatment taken with current therapy.  The key steps to discovery were to focus on increasing Glo1 and then to combine tRES and HESP together in the formulation for effective treatment.  As exciting as our breakthrough is it is important to stress that physical activity, diet, other lifestyle factors and current treatments should be adhered to.  Professor Martin O Weickert, Consultant in Diabetes and Endocrinology at UHCW NHS Trust, and co-applicant for the grant, said:  We were really excited to participate in this study with Warwick Medical School, as taking part in world-leading research makes a real difference to our patients both now and in the future.  As well as the positive effects for the UHCW patients who took part in the trial, we hope this study will lead to new treatments to help patients with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases all over the world.  Prof. Thornalley and his team are now hoping manufacturers will want to explore the use of the compound as pharmaceutical products.","Published: May 13, 2016"

This discovery can potentially be used to grow sweet tomatoes with less of a grassy odor. This research was carried out by a team from the Kobe University Graduate School of Agricultural Science: KUNISHIMA Mikiko (PhD student), Assistant Professor YAMAUCHI Yasuo, Associate Professor MIZUTANI Masaharu, Professor SUGIMOTO Yukihiro, Associate Professor KUSE Masaki, and Professor TAKIKAWA Hirosato. The aroma emitted from green leaves, sometimes referred to among plant scientists as a sweet,  green fragrance , has been the subject of research for many years. After one of the compounds behind this aroma (2-hexenal, known as the leaf aldehyde) was discovered in 1912, research continued to progress, and a large part of the mechanism responsible for this  green fragrance  has been clarified. However, the enzymes behind an important step in the process   the production of 2-hexenal from 3-hexenal   remained unidentified. While 3-hexenal is classified as an unpleasant smell, 2-hexenal is a sweet aroma, so the balance between these two compounds affects the quality of food products. For example, there is a demand for the sweet tomatoes that can be produced by reducing 3-hexenal and increasing 2-hexenal. Until now the enzymes for this process were unidentified, making artificial production extremely difficult. After referring to past research, the group decided to use peppers as their raw material. They extracted 12 micrograms of purified enzymes (hexenal isomerases) from shop-bought peppers, and identified the genes of these enzymes. The successful genetic identification led to the discovery that the same enzymes also exist in many other plant families, including solanaceae (nightshades), fabaceae (legumes), poaceae (grasses), and woody plant species. It demonstrated that many plant species possess the ability to convert 3-hexenal into 2-hexenal. Further experiments revealed that although tomatoes possess the genes that can create 2-hexenal, these genes are not usually expressed. The researchers then manifested the hexenal isomerases extracted from peppers within tomatoes. The presence of these isomerases caused a reduction in 3-hexenal and an increase in 2-hexenal within the tomatoes. These findings have made it possible to artificially stimulate hexenal isomerases within plants, and use this to control the ratio of hexenals within plants. In addition to decreasing the undesirable  green odor  in processed food and drink such as vegetable juices, by using the hexenal isomerase gene as a marker to select varieties where this enzyme is more active, we can potentially identify and selectively breed species which have a reduced  green odor .","Published: May 13, 2016"

The findings are published in the May 11 online issue of Nature.   The team, headed by Alysson R. Muotri, PhD, associate professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine departments of Pediatrics and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, and co-corresponding senior author Patricia C.B. Beltrao-Braga, PhD, at the University of Sao Paulo, conducted studies in mouse models, human stem cells and in cerebral organoids   miniature brains grown in vitro.  Rising infection rates of Zika virus in places like Brazil, with a corresponding increase in cases of microcephaly, have powerfully suggested an association, but until now hard evidence has been lacking,  said Muotri.  Our findings provide direct experimental proof that the Brazilian Zika virus strain causes severe birth defects   and that the full adverse effect upon health, even beyond microcephaly, is not yet fully understood.  Muotri said the model developed to determine Zika cause-and-effect provides a new tool to assess the effectiveness of potential therapies to counteract the virus during human neurodevelopment.  Our platform can now be used to understand what is unique about the Brazilian Zika virus and to test drugs to prevent the neurological problems associated with the infection,  he said.  Moreover, we now have a robust animal model that will be useful during validation of potential vaccines against the virus.  The Zika virus is not new. It was first described in 1947 in rhesus monkeys in Uganda, but researchers say the twin lineages of Zika   African and Asian   did not cause meaningful infections in humans until 2007, when the Asian strain, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, caused an epidemic on the Pacific island of Yap. Further outbreaks occurred in New Caledonia and French Polynesia from 2013 to 2015. In 2013, the Asian lineage of Zika reached Brazil and subsequently other countries in South and Central America. In Brazil, the virus has aroused international attention and concern, with infections of pregnant women alarmingly linked to congenital malformations, including microcephaly (an undersized head and brain) in newborns and other severe neurological diseases, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. In the Nature paper, authors used mouse models to track Brazilian virus infections to birth defects.  This is the first animal model to document Zika-induced birth defects. It shows that the virus can cross the placenta membrane and infect the fetus,  said Muotri. Like humans, newborn mouse pups infected via their mothers with the Brazilian Zika virus strain displayed smaller-than-normal heads and stunted body growth. Tissue and genetic analyses revealed other abnormalities, including eye problems and ongoing cell death.  The data in mice also suggest that microcephaly is only the tip of the iceberg. The animals have extensive intra-uterine growth arrest, which essentially means poor fetal development in the womb. Media covering the Zika story have focused upon affected babies with small heads because such images are profoundly dramatic, but the true health impact is likely to be more widespread and devastating.  Interestingly, Muotri noted that not all mouse models tested showed a causal effect when infected by the Zika virus. In at least one strain of mice, the Brazilian Zika virus could not cross the placenta of the mother to infect her unborn pups. Muotri said the finding suggests that in mice   and humans   some individuals may be more susceptible to infection than others, possibly due to genetic differences or varying robustness of the immune system response. The researchers also conducted studies using human pluripotent stem cells to generate cortical progenitor cells that ordinarily would differentiate into neurons forming the brain s cerebral cortex or folded outer layer. Infection of these cortical progenitor cells by the Brazilian viral strain resulted in increased progenitor cell death. The effects of the African virus is not as pronounced, indicating that the mutations of the Brazilian strains made the virus more aggressive in human cells. Finally, researchers exposed human brain organoids   three-dimensional buds of cells created from pluripotent stem cells that structurally represent specific organs writ small   to the Zika virus. They noted that infection resulted in reduced areas of growth in the organoids and disrupted cortical layers. Again, the Brazilian virus had a more dramatic impact on cortical malformations in these human organoids. Muotri said they tested the Brazilian Zika virus in organoids derived from chimpanzees to assess its adaptability compared to the African strain.  The Brazilian virus has a slow replication rate in the chimp organoid compared to the African virus,  Muotri said,  which suggests that the Brazilian strain has, somehow, adapted to humans. We are investigating how genetic differences might cause that difference. ","Published: May 13, 2016"

""Our study found that next generation sequencing could shine a diagnostic light on an especially challenging group of genetic disorders that impact the brain's white matter."" ""We were delighted by the power of this approach,"" adds co-author Ryan J. Taft, Ph.D., Director of Scientific Research at Illumina. ""In this study, use of next-generation sequencing-based WES dramatically increased the diagnostic yield and reduced the time to diagnosis."" ""White matter disorders can have a devastating impact on patients and their families,"" said study co-author Cas Simons, Ph.D., from the Institute for Molecular Bioscience Centre for Rare Diseases Research at UQ. ""Access to a timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to inform many health care decisions and improve quality of life for patients."" More than 100 genetic disorders are linked to white matter abnormalities in the central nervous system. At least 10 different chemicals make up the myelin, a fatty insulation layer, and the myelin sheath plays a critical role in smooth transmission of electrical impulses along nerve cells. A cluster of rare genetic disorders known as the leukodystrophies, which cause progressive degeneration of the brain's white matter, are tied to genetic flaws in how myelin makes or uses its essential mix of chemicals. Standard approaches to diagnose white matter disorders fail in nearly 50 percent of these children, complicating their care and exacting a substantial psychological toll on families, Dr. Taft says. The human genome contains roughly 3 billion letters of DNA. The exome, the protein-coding region of the genome, represents just 2 percent of this genetic code but contains most of the variants known to be related to disease. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has been tapped for the last 20 years to recognize telltale patterns of leukodystrophies, yet nearly half of patients lack concrete diagnoses. Because WES ferreted out diagnoses for other stubbornly unsolved genetic disorders, the research team has proposed that the technique could answer genetic cold cases thought to be leukodystrophies. The research team identified 191 families with unresolved cases of leukoencephalopathy thought to be genetic in nature. Of this group, they diagnosed 101 families using MRI pattern recognition followed by standard biochemical and genetic testing. For the 90 cases that remained undiagnosed, 71 family groups of at least three people were included in the study and provided the high-quality samples needed for WES analyses by the research team. While patients ranged from 3 to 26 years old at the time of sequencing, for some, symptoms began at birth. This research was performed utilizing Illumina technology. According to the study, adding WES to the diagnostic tools already at clinicians' disposal ""may decrease the number of patients with unsolved genetic white matter disorders from 50 percent to less than 30 percent. Taking into consideration the clinical and psychosocial costs of prolonged diagnostic odysseys in these families, this is substantial."" The diagnoses led to additional precision in some patients' clinical care, with families with certain mutations being referred to specialized clinics to undergo monitoring for cancer. Based on these results the team is now investigating the use of whole genome sequencing, which could further increase the diagnostic yield, in a multi-site prospective study of children with neurodevelopment disorders.","Published: May 13, 2016"

This is one of the findings of the third BfR consumer monitor. On the one hand, almost three quarters of the representatively selected participants interviewed in February 2016 believe that foods offered in the market are safe. On the other hand, more than half of the respondents are concerned about topics such as pesticide residue and microplastics in food, and genetically modified foods, all of which are closely associated with the general issue of food safety. ""This contradictory assessment shows that the context in which consumers are asked about food safety is decisive"", said Professor Dr. Dr. Andreas Hensel, President of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), in his comments on the findings of the representative survey of over 1,000 persons in Germany as part of the current BfR Consumer Monitor. ""When consumers are asked in the context of general food risks, a majority sees food as safe. However, if the question is put to them in the context of a topic which is publicly discussed predominantly in terms of its risk aspect as is the case with antimicrobial resistance and pesticides, a high degree of concern about food safety becomes apparent."" This shows, once again, that risk perception is influenced by the way topics are portrayed in the media. The BfR consumer monitor is an important instrument allowing the BfR to steer and adjust its risk communication-related activities in response to the topics discussed in the German public sphere. For this reason, a representative survey on the public s perception of health risks has been conducted on a half-yearly basis since 2014. According to the latest survey results, consumers rate climate change and / or environmental pollution as the most significant risks to health. They are seen as even worse than smoking. These are followed in their ranking of risks by malnutrition and alcohol consumption. Compared to the previous year, many more people see malnutrition as a health risk than alcohol consumption. In contrast, unhealthy and contaminated foods are seen as somewhat more relevant than in the year before. As regards awareness levels in relation to topics of consumer health protection, there were major differences compared to 2015. The best known topics are pesticide residue in fruit and vegetables, antimicrobial resistance and mineral oils in personal care products. More than three quarters of respondents are aware of those. Despite its great media presence, only a small proportion of respondents were aware of glyphosate. It is true that the debate on approval of this active ingredient used in pesticides, conducted predominantly in the media, increased public awareness of the issue by four per cent compared to the previous year. However, in terms of public awareness it is still the lowest-ranking topic among the eight consumer topics mentioned. As regards food safety, respondents were, as had already been the case in 2015, first and foremost concerned about antimicrobial resistance, closely followed by genetically modified foods and pesticide residues. While microbial contamination of food is certainly perceived as an important health risk, significantly fewer participants in this survey are worried about this potential risk than in the previous one. As last year, respondents are least concerned about food hygiene in their own household. Consumers continue to be sceptical about the safety of certain products. Almost half of the respondents do not believe that textiles, toys and cosmetic products are safe. Compared to the preceding year, consumer scepticism in relation to cosmetic products in particular has increased. The public perceives the state as playing a central role in consumer health protection and food safety. Over half of the interviewees would even like to see more measures such as bans and strict regulations in order to make foods safer and protect consumers. In addition, government institutions should provide objective and reliable information to help individuals protect themselves better. Only one tenth of respondents think that they can adequately protect themselves even without government institutions.","Published: May 13, 2016"

Marquardt will officially receive the award in September at the SCIX Conference held in Minneapolis, Minn. Marquardt is no stranger to innovation, in addition to being the co-founder of MarqMetrix , he is the director and senior principal engineer with the Center for Process Analysis and Control (CPAC) in the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington. For more than 20 years, he has brought new thinking to the fields of Raman spectroscopy, sensors and applied physics. ""FACSS is honored to recognize Brian Marquardt with the 2016 Charles Mann award in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field of Raman spectroscopy, as well as his tireless dedication to the Raman spectroscopy community and the SciX Conference,  said Steven Ray, FACSS Governing Board Chairman.  Brian s achievements are an exemplar of the spirit of this award and a fitting tribute to the memory of Professor Charlie Mann.  The most significant advancement, produced by MarqMetrix , is the development of the TouchRamanTM immersion BallProbe . For the first time, users have a sampling interface for Raman spectroscopy that is effective for measuring many different sample types including solids, slurries, powders, liquids, and gases. A stable and reproducible sample interface facilitated the application of Raman in a variety of process applications from pharma to food to the deep ocean at high temperatures and pressures.  Our goal with the TouchRamanTM immersion BallProbe  was to create a technology that allowed Raman to be more accessible across several industries and applications,  said Marquardt.  We created something that has a simple interface, and doesn t require depths of scientific knowledge to operate. It is also fairly cost-effective compared to other Raman measurement options and can be used outside the laboratory in the field.  Notably, one of the most interesting uses for the TouchRamanTM immersion BallProbe  is the ability to provide real-time validated quantitative monitoring of continuous flow reactors (CFR). The information-rich data provided by in-line Raman allows companies to quickly perform complex design of experiment (DoE) studies and optimize more effectively. Raman is now being used as a quality assurance tool for the measurement and control of final product quality for many CFR applications in both the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.  We are working on several projects where high precision, accuracy, and long-term stability of process Raman measurements are important,  said Marquardt.  We want to continually add new elements that are relevant for our customers. A good example of this is the recent launch of the disposable tip, for use when cross-contamination must be avoided.

This methodology could be useful for treating diseases in which electrical nerve activity is altered. Ballerini and Maurizio Prato (University of Trieste) are the principal investigators of the project within the European flagship on graphene, a far-reaching 10-year international collaboration that studies innovative uses of the material. See Also: Synapses: Stability in transformation Traditional treatments for neurological diseases generally include drugs that act on the brain or neurosurgery. Today however, graphene technology is showing promise for these types of applications, and is receiving increased attention from the scientific community. The method studied by Ballerini and colleagues uses ""graphene nano-ribbons"" (flakes) which buffer activity of synapses simply by being present. ""We administered aqueous solutions of graphene flakes to cultured neurons in 'chronic' exposure conditions, repeating the operation every day for a week. Analyzing functional neuronal electrical activity, we then traced the effect on synapses"" says Rossana Rauti, SISSA researcher and first author of the study. Scanning electron micrograph of a powder containing graphene flakes. Credit: ??????? ?????? ???????????, Wikimedia Commons  In the experiments, size of the flakes varied (10 microns or 80 nanometers) as well as the type of graphene: in one condition graphene was used, in another, graphene oxide. ""The 'buffering' effect on synaptic activity happens only with smaller flakes of graphene oxide and not in other conditions,"" says Ballerini. ""The effect, in the system we tested, is selective for the excitatory synapses, while it is absent in inhibitory ones"" What is the origin of this selectivity? ""We know that in principle graphene does not interact chemically with synapses in a significant way- its effect is likely due to the mere presence of synapses,"" explains SISSA researcher and one of the study's authors, Denis Scaini. ""We do not yet have direct evidence, but our hypothesis is that there is a link with the sub-cellular organization of the synaptic space."" Learn More: Only a small portion of synapses may be active during neurotransmission A synapse is a contact point between one neuron and another where the nervous electrical signal ""jumps"" between a pre and post-synaptic unit. There is a small gap or discontinuity where the electrical signal is ""translated"" by a neurotransmitter and released by pre-synaptic termination into the extracellular space and reabsorbed by the postsynaptic space, to be translated again into an electrical signal. The access to this space varies depending on the type of synapses: ""For the excitatory synapses, the structure's organization allows higher exposure for the graphene flakes interaction, unlike inhibitory synapses, which are less physically accessible in this experimental model,"" says Scaini. Another clue that distance and size could be crucial in the process is found in the observation that graphene performs its function only in the oxidized form. ""Normal graphene looks like a stretched and stiff sheet while graphene oxide appears crumpled, and thus possibly favoring interface with the synaptic space, "" adds Rauti. Administering graphene flake solutions leaves the neurons alive and intact. For this reason the team thinks they could be used in biomedical applications for treating certain diseases. ""We may imagine to target a drug by exploiting the apparent flakes' selectivity for synapses, thus targeting directly the basic functional unit of neurons""concludes Ballerini.

But when researchers saw the mice they were working with doubling their weight within a month or two, they knew they were on to something. See Also: Brain mechanism that drives us to eat glucose discovered ""About twenty years ago there was a big step forward in our understanding of obesity when researchers discovered that our appetite is controlled by a key molecule called leptin. Leptin is a hormone which is produced by our fat cells, and is delivered by the blood to the brain to signal the brain that we are full and can stop eating,"" explains Dr. Maia Kokoeva who is affiliated both with McGill University and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. ""But even though receptors for leptin were discovered soon after in the hypothalamus, a brain area that regulates food intake and body weight, it has remained unclear how exactly leptin is detected."" So about four years ago, Kokoeva and her team set out to explore which brain cells might play a role in the process of leptin sensing and weight gain. The answer, it turns out, lies in the median eminence. The median eminence is a brain structure at the base of the hypothalamus. It is a bit like a busy hub or market place through which hormones and molecules of various kinds travel in both directions between the brain and the bloodstream to ensure that the body functions smoothly. The McGill research team has now discovered that without a particular group of cells (known as NG2-glia cells) in place in the median eminence, the leptin receptors in the brain never receive the messages from the body telling it that it is sated. Learn More: Research indicates food craving is  hard-wired  in the brain ""Most of the brain is a well-protected fortress, designed to shelter delicate nerve cells,"" says Kokoeva. ""The median eminence is outside these protections, and so can be a dangerous environment for the nerve cells that detect leptin. We think that the NG2-glia cells act to support and shelter the leptin receptor neurons, enabling them to instruct the body when to stop eating."" ""We developed an interest in NG2-glia cells in this specific part of the brain because unlike neurons, during much of our adult lives these cells are constantly dividing and they do so most actively in the median eminence,"" says Tina Djogo, a McGill doctoral student and one of two lead authors on the study which is published in Cell Metabolism. ""But though these cells were first described about thirty years ago it has been difficult so far to pinpoint their exact functions in the adult brain."" Because of their particularly high turnover in the median eminence, the researchers wondered if the NG2-glia cells might play a role in leptin sensing and therefore in appetite control. So they used a drug to kill the NG2-glia cells in the median eminence of a group of mice and then watched to see whether there was a difference in food intake. The results were stunning. Within three days after they started to receive the medication, some of the mice dubbed ""gainers"" had already started to eat more compared with the control group of mice who had not received medication. And by 30 days afterwards, the weight of some of the mice had doubled - from 25 grams to around 50 grams. ""But what was most exciting to us, was that even though NG2-glia are found across the brain"" explains Sarah Robins, a research associate who was also a lead author on this study, ""it was only when we removed these cells from the median eminence that we saw this clear increase in body weight."" The researchers then corroborated the role of the NG2-glia cells in the median eminence in appetite control through experiments using genetically modified mice, and also by using irradiation. This latter discovery suggested an explanation for a previously unexplained phenomenon in human brain cancer survivors. Don't Miss: Obese teens' brains unusually susceptible to food commercials, study finds ""People who have been treated for brain tumours using radiation to block cell proliferation often become overweight,"" says Kokoeva. ""However, there has never been any satisfactory explanation, but our experiments in mice now suggests that the reason for this weight gain may be the loss of NG2-glia in the median eminence as a result of radiation."" The researchers are hopeful that the identification of NG2-glia in the median eminence as crucial elements in body weight and appetite control will pave the way to new targeted anti-obesity approaches directed towards maintaining or raising the NG2-glia population in the median eminence.

While much Alzheimer's research has focused on accumulation of the protein amyloid beta, researchers have begun to pay closer attention to another protein, tau, long associated with this disease but not studied as thoroughly, in part, because scientists only recently have developed effective ways to image tau. See Also: Immunotherapy used to reduce memory problems with Alzheimer s disease Using a new imaging agent that binds to tau protein and makes it visible in positron emission tomography (PET) scans, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have shown that measures of tau are better markers of the cognitive decline characteristic of Alzheimer's than measures of amyloid beta seen in PET scans. The new study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Comparing brain images of people who are cognitively normal to patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, the researchers found that measures of tau better predict symptoms of dementia than measures of amyloid beta. To determine degrees of cognitive impairment, some of the participants who underwent brain imaging also were assessed with the traditional clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale, cerebrospinal fluid measures, and widely used pen and paper tests of memory and other brain functions. ""Our work and that of others has shown that elevated levels of amyloid beta are the earliest markers of developing Alzheimer's disease,"" said senior author Beau M. Ances, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurology. ""But in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, even with amyloid buildup, many patients are cognitively normal, meaning their memory and thought processes are still intact. What we suspect is that amyloid changes first and then tau, and it's the combination of both that tips the patient from being asymptomatic to showing mild cognitive impairment."" Top panels: Compilations of PET brain scans of people who are cognitively normal. Bottom panels: Compilations of PET brain scans of patients with symptoms of mild Alzheimer's disease. The difference between scans of healthy people and scans of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease is much more apparent in the images that measure tau (right four images), suggesting tau protein buildup in the brain is a better marker of Alzheimer's disease symptoms than the long-studied amyloid beta buildup (left four images). Credit: Matthew R. Brier  The study included 36 control participants who were cognitively normal and 10 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. While Ances called for larger follow-up studies, he said this analysis helped establish that the new tau agent, called T807, is an important tool for understanding the timeline of Alzheimer's progression and for defining which regions of the brain are involved. ""Usually we can only diagnose patients later in the disease process, when brain function already is diminished,"" he said. ""We want to develop ways to make an earlier diagnosis and then design trials to test drugs against amyloid buildup and against tau buildup. While we currently cannot prevent or cure Alzheimer's disease, delaying the onset of symptoms by 10-15 years would make a huge difference to our patients, to their families and caregivers, and to the global economy."" Beyond establishing a timeline, Ances said the new tool is vital to gathering spatial information about affected brain areas. Elevated tau measured in cerebrospinal fluid has long been a marker of dementia, but Ances said this type of data could not pinpoint which parts of the brain are gathering abnormal proteins. Learn More: New insights could result in changes to the therapeutic strategy to combat Alzheimer s ""The spinal fluid measures are very important, but they don't give us a complete spatial picture,"" he said. ""Our new study suggests you can tolerate a certain amount of tau clumped in the hippocampus, but once it starts spreading into other areas, especially the lateral temporal and parietal lobes, that seems to be the tipping point."" With imaging agents for amyloid beta and now tau available, Ances said researchers have the tools necessary to assess the effectiveness of investigational therapies against the buildup of both proteins. The new agent is approved for use in the context of clinical research trials and likely will prove to be important in imaging the brain for other types of disorders that also involve excess tau buildup, including traumatic brain injury.

In them, the virus migrated from the pregnant mouse's bloodstream into the placenta, where it multiplied, then spread into the fetal circulation and infected the brains of the developing pups. The models provide a basis to develop vaccines and treatments, and to study the biology of Zika virus infection in pregnancy. See Also: Zika virus tested in brain precursor cells ""This is the first demonstration in an animal model of in utero transmission of Zika virus, and it shows some of the same outcomes we've been seeing in women and infants,"" said co-senior author Michael Diamond, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine, molecular microbiology and pathology and immunology. ""This could be used in vaccine trials, to find out whether vaccinating the mother can protect against uterine infection. You also could test therapeutics, once the mother got infected, to see if they could arrest the transmission to the fetus or prevent damage to the fetus."" Since mice with normal immune systems are able to fight off Zika infection, Diamond and colleagues weakened the mice's immune systems before infecting them with the virus. In one model, the researchers genetically modified mice to lack a molecule called interferon alpha receptor that plays a key role in the immune response to viral infections. In the other model, they injected mice with antibodies against the molecule. The scientists infected pregnant mice with Zika virus about a week after conception and examined their placentas and fetuses six to nine days later. Both mouse models reflected some of the key aspects of human Zika infection. In the mice, as in humans, the virus crossed from the mother's bloodstream into the fetus's and infected the developing brain, where damage to neurons was observed. Microcephaly which is marked by abnormally small heads, the most striking result of human infection was not observed in either model. This may be due to differences in how mouse and human brains develop. ""Unlike in humans, a significant amount of neurodevelopment in mice actually occurs after birth, especially in the cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain damaged in microcephaly,"" Diamond said. Indira Mysorekar, PhD, co-senior author of the study and postdoctoral fellow Bin Cao, PhD, co-first author, found the virus in the placenta at 1,000 times the concentration in the maternal blood, suggesting that it had not just migrated to the placenta, but multiplied there. In the genetically-modified mice, Zika infection caused the death of most of the fetuses, and the remaining fetuses were much smaller than normal. The placentas showed damage: They were shrunken, with a reduced number of blood vessels. Such placentas would be unable to supply enough oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus, a condition known as placental insufficiency, which causes abnormally slow fetal growth and, in severe cases, fetal death. Placental insufficiency, abnormally small fetuses and miscarriages have been reported in pregnant women infected with Zika virus, as well. In both models, the virus also was detected in the fetal brain. The researchers observed cell death in the brains of infected fetuses, but there were no obvious abnormalities in the overall structure of the brain. In the model in which mice were injected with antibodies, the effect of Zika infection was less severe. The fetuses survived, although some were smaller than normal. Diamond and colleagues plan to use this model to study whether prenatal Zika virus infection causes long-term neurological problems in pups born without obvious brain damage. Learn More: Why neural stem cells may be vulnerable to Zika infection Not all babies born to women infected with Zika during pregnancy develop microcephaly; some seem healthy at birth. But it is unknown whether such babies will face developmental or intellectual challenges as they grow up. Diamond and Mysorekar, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology, and of pathology and immunology, also want to identify the molecules the virus latches onto to get into and through the placenta, so they can block them. Zika's greatest health threat is to developing fetuses; if that threat can be eliminated, the public health emergency would be significantly lessened. ""For years, we've been studying transplacental infections and what prevents them,"" Mysorekar said. ""It's gratifying to be able to apply all that expertise to something that's suddenly become very important around the world."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

UT Southwestern Medical Center has announced the opening of a new $17 million cryo-electron microscope (cryo-EM) facility housing a unique collection of instruments that researchers can use to view 3-D images of objects as tiny as an atom all the way up to intact cells.  We are the only institution in the world with this configuration of instruments,  said Dr. Sandra Schmid, Chair of the Department of Cell Biology and holder of the Cecil H. Green Distinguished Chair in Cellular and Molecular Biology.  It establishes UT Southwestern as one of the world s top facilities for cryo-EM structural biology. The facility s three cutting-edge instruments   a Titan Krios, a Talos Arctica, and a Scios Dual Beam for thin-slice cryo-electron tomography   are expected to provide the technologies to help accelerate UT Southwestern s biomedical investigations on everything from cancer biology to drug discovery and will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. These instruments will analyze specimens that have been rapidly frozen to prevent the formation of damaging ice crystals. The specimens will then be viewed in special holders under conditions that keep them at cryogenic temperatures (minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit). The three advanced instruments and the special climate- and humidity-controlled, vibration-protected building to house them received funding from an anonymous donor, UT Southwestern, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), the UT System s Science and Technology Acquisition and Retention program, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).  This facility marks a milestone in the evolution of our structural biology research efforts at UT Southwestern. We are grateful to our supporters whose visionary generosity has helped us create this exceptional facility aimed at making fundamental basic discoveries that can be foundational for advances in medicine,  said Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky, President of UT Southwestern, who holds the Philip O Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science. In April, a symposium to commemorate the opening of the cryo-EM facility brought international cryo-EM leaders to campus. Other grand opening events included tours of the facility for faculty members, staff, and students. Cryo-EM and EM tomography allow biological specimens to be viewed in a more life-like state and environment than X-ray crystallography, the longtime gold standard of structural biology that requires assembling molecules into crystals. Many of biology s most intriguing molecules have proved notoriously resistant to crystallization, Dr. Schmid explained. The new facility is a joint effort of the Departments of Cell Biology and Biophysics. Dr. Schmid and Dr. Michael Rosen, Chair of Biophysics and an HHMI Investigator at UT Southwestern, led a team that spent four years planning and building the facility, which will be a shared resource across the academic medical center.  In addition to the unique configuration, we are planning to use these instruments collaboratively to further research all across campus   from basic research to answer fundamental scientific questions to translational investigations in which those answers may result in potential treatments for human disease,  said Dr. Rosen, who has additional appointments in Biochemistry and in the Cecil H. and Ida Green Comprehensive Center for Molecular, Computational, and Systems Biology, and who holds the Mar Nell and F. Andrew Bell Distinguished Chair in Biochemistry.  This facility will align closely with our outstanding Structural Biology Core (SBC)   the University s world-renowned facility for X-ray crystallography   led by Dr. Diana Tomchick, Professor of Biophysics and Biochemistry. That way, the University will provide a continuum of approaches across a spectrum of resolution ranges, from atoms to molecules,  he said. Each microscope has its own room with many automated elements. Because temperature changes as small as those from a human body could disrupt the precision machinery, all researchers will remain in control rooms outside the microscope rooms during operation. For example, a robotic arm inside the Titan Krios transfers frozen samples from their storage containers into the microscope for viewing, while maintaining a vacuum and cryogenic temperatures. The microscope, which is about 121 2 feet tall and weighs 2 tons, can hold and precisely move 12 samples in an automated manner so that thousands of images can be recorded, processed via computers, and interpreted to generate 3-D images for study. Like the Titan Krios, the Talos Arctica is a fully automated, but less powerful instrument that will enable researchers to screen for optimal conditions before moving onto the Titan Krios. The Scios Dual Beam is a molecular sand-blaster that precisely carves very thin slices of cells that can be transferred to and imaged in three dimensions on the Krios. In combination, these instruments will enable researchers at UT Southwestern to view the structure of cellular machines, which carry out bodily processes, in their native states and across scales from cells to molecules to atoms. This imaging is facilitated by new high-tech cameras capable of directly recording electrons rather than conventional cameras that must first convert the electron s energy to light, losing sensitivity in the process.  Advances in direct electron detector technology in the past five years have been credited with what many scientists call the  resolution revolution  that enabled cryo-EM to rival X-ray crystallography. The UT Southwestern facility will have three of the advanced detectors, Dr. Schmid said. Testing will begin on the first two instruments in May. The Talos Arctica, acquired by the HHMI and housed at UT Southwestern, will arrive this fall and will accelerate researchers  access to cryo-EM, Dr. Rosen said. Scientists will be able to schedule time on the microscopes and even view their images from remote locations via computer, enabling international collaborations, he added. The pre-opening symposium, called  The Resolution Revolution: New Windows into Cellular Structure and Function,  was held on April 25. The event, which received support from the Keith R. Porter Endowment for Cell Biology, was organized by the first new cryo-EM facility s faculty recruit, Dr. Daniela Nicastro, Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Biophysics and a CPRIT Scholar whose expertise is in cellular cryo-EM tomography. With funding from a CPRIT grant, Dr. Nicastro will study mistakes in DNA repair that are thought to drive the development of cancer.  Before you can understand how a process goes wrong, you have to understand how it works,  she explained.  And seeing is believing! ","Published: May 12, 2016"

Published in Nature and Nature Communications, two studies from the Wellcome Genome Campus pinpoint where genetic variations in breast cancers occur. The findings provide insights into the causes of breast tumours and demonstrate that breast-cancer genomes are highly individual. Each patient s cancer genome provides a complete historical account of the genetic changes that person has acquired throughout life. As they develop from a fertilised egg into full adulthood, a person s DNA gathers genetic changes along the way. Human DNA is constantly being damaged, either by things in the environment or simply from regular wear and tear in the cell. These mutations form patterns mutational signatures that can be detected, and give us clues about the causes of cancer. An international collaboration, led by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute with contributions from EMBL-EBI, analysed 560 breast cancer genomes from cancer patients from the US, Europe and Asia. The team hunted for mutations that encourage cancers to grow and looked for mutational signatures in each patient s tumour. They found that women who carry mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, who therefore have increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, had whole-cancer genome profiles that were very different to other breast cancers and highly distinctive from one other. This discovery could be used to classify patients more accurately for treatment.  In the future, we d like to be able to profile individual cancer genomes so that we can identify the treatment most likely to be successful for a woman or man diagnosed with breast cancer,  says Dr Nik-Zainal of the Sanger Institute.  It is a step closer to personalised healthcare for cancer.  Exactly where mutations occur in breast cancer genomes is important, too. Dr Ewan Birney, Senior Scientist and Director of EMBL-EBI, used new computational techniques to analyse the sequence of genetic information held in each of the sample genomes.  We know that genetic changes and their position in the cancer genome influence how a person responds to a cancer therapy,  he explains.  For years we have been trying to figure out if parts of DNA that don t code for anything specific have a role in driving cancer development. This study gave us the first large-scale view of the rest of the genome, uncovering some new reasons why breast cancer arises. It also gave us an unexpected way to characterise the types of mutations that happen in certain breast cancers.   Unpicking the genetic variations between cancers is crucial to developing improved therapies,  says Professor Sir Mike Stratton, Director of the Sanger Institute.  This huge study, the largest of any one cancer type to date, gives insights into which genetic variations exist, and where they are in the genome. This has implications for other types of cancer, too. The study itself shows it is possible to sequence individual cancer genomes and this should lead to benefits for patients in the long term.

It is well known that social and other environmental factors influence education, but these findings, reported by the Social Science Genetics Association Consortium (SSGAC) and supported in part by the National Institutes of Health, suggest that large genetics analyses may be able to help discover biological pathways as well. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) was supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, both part of NIH, and appears in the May 11, 2016, issue of Nature.  This is an interesting development in behavior genetics,  said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D.  It extends our understanding of the connection between the genetic components of cognition and years of formal education.  The SSGAC, led by Daniel J. Benjamin, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California, found 74 separate areas (loci) on human chromosomes that are associated with more years of education. These loci are also associated with other areas that correlate with increased cognitive performance and intracranial volume, decreased levels of emotional instability (neuroticism) and decreased risk of Alzheimer s disease. The researchers conducted the GWAS on almost 294,000 people, of primarily European descent, from research across the globe. Genetic samples were obtained from several ongoing studies, including many funded by NIA: the Health and Retirement Study, the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavic Study, and the SardiNIA Study of Aging, as well as dozens of other cohorts. Crucially, the team then replicated these findings in an independent sample of more than 111,000 people from the UK BioBank study. Previous research has shown that genetic factors account for about 20 percent of variation in educational attainment. In this study, 74 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The investigators note that, as a group, these SNPs only account for a very small portion (0.43 percent) of the variation across individuals in the sample; individually, each SNP has a very small influence. The study team regards this study as preliminary and exploratory. Because educational attainment is a complex phenomenon, there are many additional sources of molecular genetic variation to be discovered. Other genetic and environmental effects and their interactions are important topics for future research.  These study results will enable us to ask more refined questions about the genetic and environmental underpinnings of educational attainment and their health consequences,  said Jonathan W. King, Ph.D., program director in NIA s Division of Behavioral and Social Research, which supports the SSGAC.  For example, we ve known for quite a while that education appears to be a protective factor against Alzheimer s. But, education is itself a very complicated outcome. It depends on genetic contributions to cognitive ability and other characteristics that motivate individuals to continue education, as well as substantial environmental contributions to educational success.  The results of this study and future work will enable us to better understand how these pathways interact,  King continued.  Perhaps ultimately, we ll be able to learn why and how educational attainment seems to be protective of cognition in later life.  The size of the study made it possible to answer questions not able to be addressed previously. For example, the researchers were able to identify many more loci that appear to contribute to cognitive ability than had been previously known because of the large number of participants. The study has implications for future research, where these links can be further explored. Data on the level of education attained by participants is routinely collected. With that information and a DNA sample, investigators can conduct additional GWAS of other racial and ethnic groups, which could allow identification of new variants and genetic pathways associated with educational attainment and further validate the contribution of loci from the study reported. The research was coordinated by SSGAC. Funded by the NIA, the SSGAC is a cooperative enterprise among biomedical researchers and social scientists that coordinates genetic association studies for social science outcomes and provides a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration.","Published: May 12, 2016"

These injuries occur most frequently from falling, but can also result from military combat, car accidents, contact sports or domestic abuse. Recently, physicians and researchers have become increasingly concerned that even mild cases of repetitive brain trauma could have long-term, unanticipated consequences. See Also: Impact of traumatic brain injury on long-term memory explored Given the prevalence of these injuries, it's surprising that the genes and cellular pathways that can blunt TBI's harmfulness are relatively unknown, said Kim Finley, an associate professor at the San Diego State University (SDSU) Donald P. Shiley BioScience Center. A new study led by SDSU scientists and recently published in the journal Scientific Reports suggests that using fruit flies as a TBI model may hold the key to identifying important genes and pathways that promote the repair of and minimize damage to the nervous system. ""Fruit flies actually have a very complex nervous system,"" said Finley, the study's co-lead author. ""They are also an incredible model system that has been used for over 100 years for genetic studies, and more recently to understand the genes that maintain a healthy brain."" In humans, changes in mood, headaches and sleep problems are just a few of the possible symptoms associated with suffering mild traumatic brain injury. The timeline for these symptoms can vary greatly: Some people experience them immediately following injury, while others may develop problems many years after. Finley noted that because fruit flies grow old quickly, observing them allows researchers to rapidly study the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury. ""Traits that might take 40 years to develop in people can occur in flies within two weeks,"" she said. To test whether flies can be used to model traumatic brain injuries, Finley and colleagues used an automated system to vigorously shake and traumatize thousands of fruit flies. Learn More: Scientists test Actual Reality for functional assessment after traumatic brain injury ""Fruit flies come out of this mild trauma and appear perfectly normal,"" explained Eric Ratliff, an adjunct assistant professor at SDSU and the study's other co-lead author. ""However, the flies quickly begin to show signs of decline, similar to problems found in people who have been exposed to head injuries."" In their study, injured fruit flies showed damage to neurons within the brain, as well as an accumulation of a protein called hyper-phosphorylated Tau, a hallmark feature of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Furthermore, injured flies also began to experience insomnia and their normal sleep patterns deteriorated. The results suggest that studying traumatic injury in fruit flies may indeed reveal genetic and cellular factors that can improve the brain's resilience to injuries. ""It's really a unique model,"" Finley said. ""We've developed it to be reliable, inexpensive, and fast."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

The research marked the first time the approach has been used to calculate drug doses for a clinical trial in pediatric brain tumor patients. ""The approach used in this study should serve as a template for drug development, especially for rare diseases like ependymoma where the need for promising therapies is high but few patients are available for clinical trials,"" said corresponding author Clinton Stewart, PharmD, a member of the St. Jude Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The findings appeared recently in the journal CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology. See Also: Scientists find way to disrupt brain tumor stem cells Ependymoma occurs in about 200 US children and adults annually, but the disease is most common in infants and children. The five-year survival rate for pediatric patients is 72 percent. Effective chemotherapy for the tumor is lacking. Surgery and radiation therapy are the foundation of current treatment. A previous St. Jude-led study found that ependymoma tumors shrank and mice lived longer when high-dose chemotherapy with the drug 5-fluorouracil was administered rapidly as an intravenous bolus rather than infused gradually. Through bolus administration, researchers hoped to magnify the drug's therapeutic potential by helping to rapidly achieve a high therapeutic level of 5-fluorouracil in the bloodstream. The drug is widely used for treatment of colon cancer and has been administered as a bolus in adults, but nothing was known about how children would handle 5-fluorouracil after bolus dosing. A challenge for researchers designing the phase I clinical trial of bolus-administered 5-fluorouracil was how to use data from mice and adults to calculate the pediatric dose. Phase I studies are designed to evaluate drug safety, identify side effects and determine the drug dose to use in subsequent clinical trials of safety and effectiveness. The challenge was to identify a dose likely to kill tumor cells but not cause serious side effects. To answer the question, researchers in this study used applied mathematics, supercomputers and other tools to analyze data from mice and adults to model and simulate the optimal dose for pediatric ependymoma patients. The analysis included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data. Pharmacokinetic data included blood and brain levels of 5-fluorouracil collected at different times and at different doses. Pharmacodynamics focused on how the drug affected tumor growth and survival of the mice. Learn More: Chemotherapy-induced hearing loss affects neurocognition in pediatric brain tumor survivors Based on the analysis, researchers recommended patients enrolled in the St. Jude-led phase I trial receive a starting 5-fluorouracil dose of 500 milligrams per meter2 body surface area administered weekly as a bolus for up to 16 treatment cycles. The study included 26 patients, ages 22 years old and younger with ependymoma that recurred after treatment. ""The results of the phase I clinical trial supported the model-based dosing recommendations,"" Stewart said. The model helped to streamline identification of the optimal dose and reflects advances in supercomputing that have occurred since 2000, said co-first author Yogesh Patel, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Stewart's laboratory. ""The results gave us greater confidence going into the phase I study that the recommended dose would be sufficient for anti-tumor activity,"" he said.

A study at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reviewed 13 cancer types and provided a molecular understanding of sex effects in diverse cancers. The research revealed two cancer-type groups associated with cancer incidence and mortality, suggesting a  pressing need  to develop sex-specific therapeutic strategies for some cancers. The research findings are published in the May 9 online issue of Cancer Cell. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, a team led by Han Liang, Ph.D., associate professor of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, found more than half of the genes studied that were related to clinical practice of cancer treatment showed sex-biased signatures in certain cancer types.  Our study helps elucidate the molecular basis for sex disparities in cancer and lays a critical foundation for the future development of precision cancer medicine that is sex-specific,  said Liang.  This is a crucial finding as currently, male and female patients with many cancer types often are treated in a similar way without explicitly considering their gender.  Liang s group performed a comprehensive analysis of molecular differences between male and female patients, revealing two sex-effect groups associated with distinct incidence and mortality profiles and accounting for 53 percent of clinically actionable genes. Those genes are informative for clinical decisions and are either therapeutic targets or biomarkers that can help predict patient survival or tumor response. In the study, Liang found one group contained a small number of sex-affected genes (weak group), while the other showed a much greater number of sex-biased molecular signatures (strong group). Liang said the current equal treatment of both genders may be appropriate for those in the  weak  group, but observations in the  strong  group are clinically significant.  Special consideration should be given to those in the strong sex-effect group in terms of both drug development and practice,  said Liang.  For a therapeutic target with a strong sex-biased signature, sex-specific clinical trials may be more likely to succeed. This new information is vital as the fundamental issue of sex differences for cancer prevention and therapy has not been investigated systematically.  Liang s team analyzed data in patient cohorts of 30 or greater samples for each sex for various cancers of the bladder, colon, kidney, brain, rectum, thyroid, liver and lung as well as acute myeloid leukemia. They looked for specific molecular data including somatic mutations, copy alterations, protein and gene expression and DNA methylation. The study included controls for other factors such as race, age, disease stage, smoking status and tumor purity.  Interestingly, our analysis also suggested that sex bias might be amplified during the tumor formation process,  said Liang.  However this observation should be interpreted with caution at this early stage as further efforts are needed to determine the relative contributions of other factors, including tumorigenesis, sex chromosomes and hormones.

Infection is the leading cause of death in this fragile patient population. The Heart Rate Observation system, or HeRO, is an innovative monitoring technology that uses an algorithm to detect slight changes in a baby s heartbeat that could be an early sign of a major infection, like sepsis   a bacterial infection that is highly dangerous to babies born three pounds or less.  The challenge with diagnosing sepsis is a lot of symptoms for the early stages of the infection are subtle and nonspecific,  said Erika Fernandez, MD, director of the NICU at UC San Diego Health.  With the HeRO technology, we can detect symptoms of sepsis up to 24 hours before the infection actually happens. This allows us to begin an investigation and intervene with treatment before a baby becomes critically ill.  UC San Diego Health is the first health care provider in San Diego County to use the technology, which can detect infections in the blood stream and intestines. Historically, physicians and nurses have relied upon their own observations to detect signs of infection. The new system reports vital sign trends much earlier than the human eye or traditional equipment and requires no additional wiring to the baby.  This state-of-the-art technology lets babies be babies, and mothers can breastfeed without worrying about tangling up or unplugging wires,  said Lawrence Prince, MD, PhD, chief in the Division of Neonatology at UC San Diego Health.  It makes for a much less intimidating experience for families and a highly improved monitoring approach for medical staff. The HeRO system uses a zero-to-seven surveillance score generated after a heart rate is analyzed, with anything higher than a two considered an alert for possible infection. Prince says the technology is expected to reduce mortality rates in the NICU by 20 percent.  Physicians and nurses can evaluate a situation much more thoroughly,  said Prince.  When I look at the data on the monitor, I can ask myself,  is there something more going on with the patient and do we need to do further testing?  Fernandez added that the monitoring system represents part of the next generation of technology to save lives and help achieve the ultimate goal in the NICU:  To provide the highest quality of comprehensive and compassionate care to NICU babies so they can thrive and go home with their families as soon as possible.

The Oxford team has been led by Professor Matthew Wood, Professor of Neuroscience at Oxford, and Dr Samir El Andaloussi, Research Fellow at Oxford and Assistant Professor at Sweden's Karolinska Institutet. They found that by using the body's own mini-transporters   tiny circular nanostructures which shuttle materials between cells   they are able to smuggle drug therapies into the brain, targeting new treatments to the correct tissues. The mini-transporters are called exosomes. They are completely natural, made in the millions by the body's cells to communicate and carry molecules between cells. 'Getting drugs into the brain is one of the major roadblocks which stops us treating a huge number of diseases including Alzheimer's and many cancers,' said Professor Wood. 'Over 98% of current drug treatments do not cross the blood brain barrier, which is there as a protective mechanism, but also stymies the delivery of many treatments. 'What we are able to do is customise these exosomes to carry a therapeutic payload such as a protein or RNA drug, and to target this to particular tissues   including tissues in the brain. 'In doing this successfully, we should be able to improve the effectiveness of new medicines as well as limit their side-effects. Exosome therapies could be transformative for diseases involving neurodegeneration, dementia, and inflammation in the brain. Rather than injecting a drug directly into the brain, we could administer treatments intravenously or as a pill. 'We also believe this approach will be a turning point for delivery of next-generation RNA therapeutics and gene editing technologies.' The University's technology commercialisation company Isis Innovation supported the team by filing patents, building the business plan and marketing the opportunity.

This will enable TGAC researchers to store, categorise and analyse more genomic data in less time for decoding living systems and answering crucial biological questions.  This new TGAC platform comprises two SGI UV 300 systems totalling 24 terabytes (TB) of shared-memory, 512 Intel  Xeon  Processor E7 v3 cores and 64TB of Intel  P3700 SSDs with NVMe* storage technology. Each SGI UV 300 flash memory solution features 12TB  of shared-memory with 7th  generation SGI NUMAlink  ASIC technology, scaling up to 64 TB of global addressable memory as a single system.  Paired with flash storage, the combined 24TB SGI UV 300 supercomputers can increase processing speeds of heavy workloads in scientific research by 80 percent. This combination of leading-edge technology allows TGAC researchers to benefit from the faster processing capabilities of the SGI UV 300, providing an extraordinarily powerful platform for genomics analysis.  In particular, the system will dramatically reduce the time to perform large genome assembly that TGAC researchers specialise in, as well as the analysis of wheat genotype and phenotype data generated by the Seeds of Discovery programme. TGAC will use the pioneering SGI HPC technology to enable faster analysis of complex genomes which require both large memory and fast processing capabilities, providing a powerful boost to TGAC s research projects. This will include sequencing and assembling multiple lines of wheat with the Institute s  w2rap  assembly software - developed by the Algorithm Development team led by Bernardo Clavijo.  The new technology will also be used to aid the development of novel analysis techniques for data integration, by taking advantage of the larger, faster memory-per-core specifications of the system and its accelerated I/O capabilities from the NVMe SSDs. This will provide a significant speedup of data movement between the hardware and TGAC s genome analysis software.  Dr Tim Stitt, Head of Scientific Computing at TGAC, said:  Continuing our successful collaborations with SGI and Intel in deploying novel and innovative computing technology, the new SGI UV 300 appliance with NVMe SSDs will undoubtedly be a leader in field of genomic analysis.   With the unique shared-memory technology from SGI and Intel s leading processor and non-volatile memory storage solutions, this system will set the new yardstick for large-scale data-intensive bioinformatics computations. The combination of processor performance, memory capacity and one of the largest deployments of Intel SSD storage worldwide makes this a truly powerful computing platform for the life sciences.  Jorge Titinger, president and CEO, SGI, said:  The complexity of genomic data and workloads today requires high performance computing (HPC) to provide new insights for researchers and allow them to derive conclusions from the massive data jigsaw puzzle. This enables TGAC to tackle fundamental problems such as increasing the yield of crops to keep up with the population growth. SGI is honored to be extending the partnership with TGAC by providing the SGI UV 300 architecture. This system is designed for data intensive, in-memory, I/O demanding applications and includes the very latest NUMAlink 7 ASIC, scaling right up to 64TB of globally addressable memory as a single system. This is all done using Open Standards unmodified Linux allowing for the SGI UV to be run as one system, offering flexibility for exploring new algorithms and programming models without restriction.   By tightly coupling the Intel  P3700 SSDs with NVMe* storage technology with the latest generation SGI UV 300 system, SGI allows customers like TGAC to achieve extraordinary bandwidth and inputs/outputs per second (IOPS) and will keep TGAC research and productivity at the very top of this highly competitive worldwide domain of genomic analysis. We are very proud of such a successful collaboration and look forward to TGAC researchers achieving, even more, breakthroughs and accelerated productivity with this new system,  said Titinger. Ketan Paranjape, general manager of Intel s Life Sciences team, added:  Knowledge of plant and animal genomes can lead to breakthroughs in drug discovery, food safety, and more, helping us to better manage climate change, feed a growing population, and mitigate the impact of newly emergent diseases. With the SGI UV 300 system, Intel Xeon Processor E7 v3 product family and Intel DC P3700 SSDs with NVMe, TGAC can now assemble large plant and animal genomes in record times that, until a few months ago, were impossible.  Part of the SGI UV server line for high performance in-memory computing, the new SGI UV 300 are advanced symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems designed for compute-intensive, fast algorithm workloads such as genome assembly, computer-aided engineering (CAE) and scientific simulations. Limitations on computer clusters to perform analytics on very large data sets in-memory and scale without severe latency implications caused by the cluster networking have led to a surge in scale-up server platforms.  The SGI UV server, in its fifth generation,  is well placed to serve this need. For TGAC, a key benefit for using this most powerful system is the scalability and memory capabilities to execute some of the most demanding data and compute-intensive workloads including large, complex  genome assembly and analytics. The SGI UV with the Intel  Xeon  Processor E7 v3 product family create a powerful technology that can advance genomic breakthroughs.

To develop drugs that would prevent viruses from causing infections, researchers need to know the genetic mechanisms that viruses use to infect healthy cells. Those mechanisms become the drug targets. Determining what mechanisms to target requires screening the DNA in host cells for genetic modifications. This is done by removing or  knocking out  genes suspected of being key to viruses  infection or replication mechanisms. Led by Robert Damoiseaux, associate professor of pharmacology, UCLA scientists have recently partnered with the Sandia National Laboratory to develop special screening libraries based on a gene-editing technology called CRISPR, an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. CRISPR evolved in nature as a defense against bacteria and now it gives researchers a powerful genome-editing technology that is inexpensive and quick, Damoiseaux said. The current method of producing individual genetic constructs one-by-one is expensive and labor-intensive.  These new libraries enable more cost-efficient and rigorous research than traditional approaches, and are allowing us to screen for target genes that are of much more subtly different types with greater accuracy,  Damoiseaux said. Employing CRISPR technology also avoids problems with current gene-editing methods, which don t completely remove the targeted genes, resulting in some false negatives. CRISPR gene-editing totally removes the genes in question, giving a much more accurate screening of the desired genetic change, Damoiseaux said. Damoiseaux s team starts out with a mixture of CRISPR constructs   a pooled library of DNA segments   that is easy and inexpensive to produce, then separates the mixture into individual constructs using high-throughput robotic equipment in the Molecular Screening Shared Resource at the CNSI. By separating the mixtures into individual library members, or arraying, then screening them individually using fast robotics, genes in the human genome that are essential for Zika infection can be determined in a very short period. Researchers can then begin to design antiviral treatments targeting these identified genes and find cures more rapidly. With the Sandia National Laboratory as industrial partner, Damoiseaux s team is seeking to take their current work and create an arrayed CRISPR library that will further lower costs and increase the speed of antiviral drug development.  A pooled CRISPR library is a complex mixture of thousands of DNA fragments like a mix of jelly beans in a glass. An arrayed library is more like individually wrapped and labeled jellybeans  said Damoiseaux, who is also the director of the Molecular Screening Shared Resource at CNSI.  When you identify a set of genes involved in viral replication using CRISPR from a pooled screening campaign, you must still run a set of experiments to confirm each individual gene to know what you have,  Damoiseaux continued.  In an arrayed library, the researcher is ahead of the game because the screening identifies individual genes directly, making it more rigorous and able to capture more subtle effects than pooled approaches.  Arrayed CRISPR libraries also have many applications in other research specialties such as cancer treatment. Through enabling a better understanding of human health, CRISPR technology will lead scientists to very exciting discoveries and new cures for many genetic diseases.","Published: May 11, 2016"

The system described in the journal Science Advances also would allow point-of-care diagnosis, as it does not require the facilities and expertise available only in hospital laboratories.   Health-care-associated infections are a major problem that affects more than 600,000 patients each year, more than 10 percent of whom will die, and incurs more $100 billion in related costs,  says Ralph Weissleder, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Center for Systems Biology, Thrall Family Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and co-senior author of the report.  Rapid and efficient diagnosis of the pathogen is a critical first step in choosing the appropriate antibiotic regimen, and this system could provide that information in a physician s office in less than two hours.  While considered the gold standard for diagnosing bacterial infections, traditional culture-based diagnosis can take several days and requires specialized equipment, trained laboratory personnel and procedures that vary depending on the particular pathogen. Emerging genetic approaches that identify bacterial species by their nucleic acid sequences are powerful but still require complex equipment and workflows, restricting such testing to specialized hospital laboratories. The system developed by the MGH team, dubbed PAD for Polarization Anisotropy Diagnostics, allows for accurate genetic testing in a simple device. Bacterial RNA is extracted from a sample in a small, disposable plastic cartridge. Following polymerase chain reaction amplification of the RNA, the material is loaded into a 2-cm plastic cube containing optical components that detect target RNAs based on the response to a light signal of sequence-specific detection probes. These optical cubes are placed on an electronic base station that transmits data to a smartphone or computer where the results can be displayed. In this proof-of-principle study, the team used a prototype PAD system containing four optical cubes to test clinical samples from nine patients and compared the results with those acquired by conventional microbiology cultures. Testing for the presence of five important bacterial species   E. coli, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Staph aureus   and for factors indicating the virulence and antibiotic resistance of specific strains produced identical results with both procedures. But while PAD provided results in less than two hours, the bacterial culture process took three to five days. The team has now designed probes for more than 35 bacterial species and virulence factors, and the overall cost of running the PAD assay should not exceed $2.00.   This prototype still needs several improvements, including building a self-contained system housing all functions, further reducing the current assay time to less than one hour and expanding the panel of probes to even more pathogens and resistance factors,  says Hakho Lee, PhD, of MGH Center for Systems Biology (CSB), co-senior author of the report and an associate professor of Radiology at HMS.  But we can see three immediate applications for a system that can provide such rapid and accurate results   quickly diagnosing a patient s infection, determining whether antibiotic-resistant bacteria are present in a group of patients, and detecting bacterial contamination of medical devices or patient environments.

The research is published in a top scientific journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of USA.  Single-humped  Arabian camels , properly known as  dromedaries  (Camelus dromedarius), have been fundamental to the development of human societies, providing food and transport in desert countries, for over 3000 years. The dromedary continues to be a vital resource in trade and agriculture in hot, dry areas of the world, providing transport, milk and meat where other species would not survive. In the current context of climate change and advancing desert landscapes, the animal s importance is increasing and there is new interest in the biology and reproduction of the species. The researchers have collected and analysed genetic information from a sample of 1,083 living dromedaries from 21 countries across the world. The team combined this with an examination of ancient DNA sequences from bone samples from early-domesticated dromedaries from 400-1870AD and wild ones from 5,000-1,000BC to reveal for the first time ever an historic genetic picture of the species.  Professor of Genetics and Conservation, Olivier Hanotte, from the School of Life Sciences at Nottingham, said:  Our analysis of this extensive dataset actually revealed that there is very little defined population structure in modern dromedaries. We believe this is a consequence of cross-continental back and forth movements along historic trading routes. Our results point to extensive gene flow which affects all regions except East Africa where dromedary populations have remained relatively isolated.  Dr Faisal Almathen from the Department of Veterinary Health and Animal Husbandry at King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia, added:  The dromedary has outperformed all other domesticated mammals, including the donkey, in arid environments and continues to provide essential commodities to millions of people living in marginal agro-ecological areas. The genetic diversity we have discovered, thanks to restocking from wild  ghost  dromedary populations, is quite remarkable in the history of its domestication. It underlines the animal s potential to adapt sustainably to future challenges of expanding desert areas and global climate change. ","Published: May 11, 2016"

The novel approach builds on ground-breaking research results from Prof. Moritz Rossner and his team at the Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine in G ttingen. He will work closely together with the LDC team to identify and optimize novel compounds with strong therapeutic potential and develop it further to the stage of a validated pharmaceutical lead with in vivo efficacy. Moritz Rossner holds also a Professorship at Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich and is a co-founder of Systasy Bioscience GmbH. Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling mental disorder ranked among the 12 most debilitating diseases by the World Health Organization. It affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide, changing the way they behave, think and perceive the world. Although anti-psychotic medications and psychosocial interventions can effectively reduce symptoms and improve patients  lives, there remainsa strong need for new drugs truly addressing causative mechanisms and cognitive impairment.  Schizophrenia is an incredibly complex disorder which dramatically changes the life of the individual affected,  says Prof. Rossner.  We believe our approach holds strong potential to improve the treatment options for patients, and this collaboration with the LDC and Boehringer Ingelheim is a great opportunity to advance it from our laboratory into pharmaceutical development.  In this early discovery project Boehringer Ingelheim will take a seat on the project development team and will pay an option fee. In addition, the company will allocate internal resources to the program and support collaborating partners to strengthen the early development work. Once the project has attained proof-of-concept in relevant invivo models Boehringer Ingelheim can exclusively license the lead at pre-defined terms for subsequent preclinical and clinical development. Any revenue the LDC may receive from commercialization will be shared with the academic inventors and collaborating institutions. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder which affects how a person behaves, thinks and perceives the world.  Since the LDC s inception, we have been in close contact with Boehringer Ingelheim, establishing a relationship based on mutual trust over the years. We very much appreciate their expertise and commitment to driving forward innovative therapeutic approaches, says Dr. Bert Klebl, CEO of the LDC.  It is a great pleasure for us to be launching our first joint project in the field of mental disorders, which we believe is often underestimated.

People with this form of diabetes can t make their own insulin and require regular insulin injections to control their blood sugar. The new discovery suggests a personalized treatment approach to diabetes may be on the horizon   one that relies on the patients  own stem cells to manufacture new cells that make insulin. The researchers showed that the new cells could produce insulin when they encountered sugar. The scientists tested the cells in culture and in mice, and in both cases found that the cells secreted insulin in response to glucose. The research is published May 10 in the journal Nature Communications.  In theory, if we could replace the damaged cells in these individuals with new pancreatic beta cells   whose primary function is to store and release insulin to control blood glucose   patients with type 1 diabetes wouldn t need insulin shots anymore,  said first author Jeffrey R. Millman, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine and of biomedical engineering at Washington University School of Medicine.  The cells we ve manufactured sense the presence of glucose and secrete insulin in response. And beta cells do a much better job controlling blood sugar than diabetic patients can.  Millman, whose laboratory is in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Lipid Research, began his research while working in the laboratory of Douglas A. Melton, PhD, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a co-director of Harvard s Stem Cell Institute. There, Millman had used similar techniques to make beta cells from stem cells derived from people who did not have diabetes. In these new experiments, the beta cells came from tissue taken from the skin of diabetes patients.  There had been questions about whether we could make these cells from people with type 1 diabetes,  Millman explained.  Some scientists thought that because the tissue would be coming from diabetes patients, there might be defects to prevent us from helping the stem cells differentiate into beta cells. It turns out that s not the case.  Millman said more research is needed to make sure that the beta cells made from patient-derived stem cells don t cause tumors to develop   a problem that has surfaced in some stem cell research   but there has been no evidence of tumors in the mouse studies, even up to a year after the cells were implanted. He said the stem cell-derived beta cells could be ready for human research in three to five years. At that time, Millman expects the cells would be implanted under the skin of diabetes patients in a minimally invasive surgical procedure that would allow the beta cells access to a patient s blood supply.  What we re envisioning is an outpatient procedure in which some sort of device filled with the cells would be placed just beneath the skin,  he said. The idea of replacing beta cells isn t new. More than two decades ago, Washington University researchers Paul E. Lacy, MD, PhD, now deceased, and David W. Scharp, MD, began transplanting such cells into patients with type 1 diabetes. Still today, patients in several clinical trials have been given beta cell transplants with some success. However, those cells come from pancreas tissue provided by organ donors. As with all types of organ donation, the need for islet beta cells for people with type 1 diabetes greatly exceeds their availability. Millman said that the new technique also could be used in other ways. Since these experiments have proven it s possible to make beta cells from the tissue of patients with type 1 diabetes, it s likely the technique also would work in patients with other forms of the disease   including type 2 diabetes, neonatal diabetes and Wolfram syndrome. Then it would be possible to test the effects of diabetes drugs on the beta cells of patients with various forms of the disease.","Published: May 11, 2016"

Building off previous work done at Harvard s Wyss Institute by Collins and his team, along with collaborators from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Harvard Medical School (HMS), University of Toronto, Arizona State University (ASU), University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Boston University (BU), Cornell University, and Addgene, joined their efforts to quickly prototype the rapid diagnostic test and describe their methods in a study published online May 6 in the journal Cell, all within a matter of six weeks. Collins is the paper s corresponding author. Emerging innovation during the Ebola health crisis In October 2014, Collins  team developed a breakthrough method for embedding synthetic gene networks   which could be used as programmable diagnostics and sensors   on portable, small discs of ordinary paper. Stirred by the then-ongoing Ebola outbreak in Africa, they demonstrated a proof-of-concept color-changing diagnostic that could screen for Ebola by embedding in paper a novel kind of synthetic biomolecular sensor designed to screen for specific RNA sequences. These RNA sequences can mark not only the genetic signatures of Ebola but also other RNA viruses including Zika, SARS, measles, influenza, hepatitis C, and West Nile fever. The team believed that one day, the method could be applied in the field to identify viruses with blood, urine, or saliva samples. However, until recently, the team s paper-based technology has been challenged by the extremely low concentration of virus that is normally found in blood, urine, and saliva. Now, using blood samples from monkeys infected with Zika virus as well as virus recovered from cells infected in the laboratory, the team has validated a next generation technique that overcomes this problem. A leap for paper-based diagnostics, urged by the Zika outbreak ""The vivid images in the news stemming from the ongoing Zika crisis are heartbreaking,"" said Keith Pardee, Ph.D., one of the study s co-first authors and an Assistant Professor in the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy at University of Toronto, who was formerly a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and BU. ""We hope a tool like this can help reduce the impact of the outbreak until a vaccine can be developed."" With field use in mind, Collins' team designed a simple modular workflow comprising three steps: amplification, Zika detection, and CRISPR-Cas9-aided strain identification. CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing mechanism derived from the immune systems of bacteria, can be used to search entire sequences to find exclusive genetic markers. Leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 s talent for sequence recognition, the third part of the team s system uses a CRISPR-Cas9-aided paper-based diagnostic to discriminate between strains whose genetic profiles differ by as little as one nucleotide. Once a sample s RNA has been amplified using a mixture of enzymes and  primers , DNA sequences that trigger replication, a drop is administered to paper discs that are freeze-dried containing a mixture of cellular components and biological proteins. The droplet of amplified RNA activates the freeze-dried components so that the discs will change color to indicate a positive result for Zika virus. While the result can be read with the naked eye similar to a home pregnancy test, a specially designed electronic reader can also be used to get faster results and could, one day, quantify the amount of viral load in a sample. If Zika is detected, the third step involves mixing a sample with a freeze-dried CRISPR-Cas9 cocktail and then using that mixture to wet another set of color-changing paper discs. Depending on the type of Zika strain contained in the sample, these discs undergo another set of visible color changes. Although synthetic biologists and genetic engineers usually put CRISPR-Cas9 to work inside living cells, Collins  team discovered that it functions just as well - and even better in some cases - when freeze dried. ""We have tested our diagnostic systems against closely-related strains of the Dengue virus and found that within the first two steps, our system can readily distinguish Zika from Dengue,"" said Alexander Green, Ph.D., co-first author on the study and an Assistant Professor in the Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics at ASU s Biodesign Institute and School of Molecular Sciences, who was formerly a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and BU. ""The addition of the third CRISPR-based step   deploying Cas9 on a paper-based platform for the first time   only enhances the accuracy of detection. As we prepare this technology for translation, we plan to validate our system against dozens or even hundreds of clinical samples."" Combating future pandemics All components of the diagnostic system can be freeze-dried for storage and transport while retaining their efficacy. The ability to pinpoint a strain-specific diagnosis in the field could prove valuable to national and global health organizations for tracking the spread of a viral outbreak in real time and for preparing containment strategies and treatment plans. The diagnostic system developed by Collins  team could be tailored to identify a range of pathogens, and is an extremely cost effective diagnostic platform given its paper-based nature. What s more   the method is robust and could be used to quickly respond and develop new diagnostics in the face of emerging outbreaks. ""In response to an emerging outbreak, we envision a custom-tailored diagnostic system could be ready for use within one week s time,"" said Collins. ""We are currently pursuing multiple opportunities to secure private and public funding in order to commercialize this diagnostic system and make it available to the world s health responders."" ""The ability to recapitulate the genetic machinery of living cells in ordinary freeze dried paper provides a way to develop revolutionary sensors and diagnostics in a fraction of the time and with higher sensitivity and specificity than more conventional assays. These inexpensive paper-based tests also can be easily transported out of the laboratory and distributed virtually anywhere around the world. The potential for applications in health and environmental screening, particularly in low resource areas, is huge,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children s Hospital, and also Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

Current non-invasive detection methods like mammograms are unsatisfactory. Lipidomics, a promising detection method, may serve as a novel prognostic approach for breast cancer in high-risk patients. RESULTS: According the predictive model, the combination of 15 lipid species had high diagnostic value. In the training set, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the combination of these 15 lipid species were 83.3%, 92.7%, 89.7%, and 87.9%, respectively. The AUC in the training set was 0.926 (95% CI 0.869-0.982). Similar results were found in the validation set, with the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV at 81.0%, 94.5%, 91.9%, and 86.7%, respectively. The AUC was 0.938 (95% CI 0.889-0.986) in the validation set. METHODS: Using triple quadrupole liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, this study was to detect global lipid profiling of a total of 194 plasma samples from 84 patients with early-stage breast cancer (stage 0-II) and 110 patients with benign breast disease included in a training set and a validation set. A binary logistic regression was used to build a predictive model for evaluating the lipid species as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

See Also: Training brain patterns of empathy using functional brain imaging Researchers at The Ohio State University found, for example, that when participants who took acetaminophen learned about the misfortunes of others, they thought these individuals experienced less pain and suffering,when compared to those who took no painkiller. ""These findings suggest other people's pain doesn't seem as big of a deal to you when you've taken acetaminophen,"" said Dominik Mischkowski, co-author of the study and a former PhD student at Ohio State, now at the National Institutes of Health. ""Acetaminophen can reduce empathy as well as serve as a painkiller."" Mischkowski conducted the study with Baldwin Way, who is an assistant professor of psychology and member of the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center's Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research; and Jennifer Crocker, Ohio Eminent Scholar in Social Psychology and professor of psychology at Ohio State. Their results were published online in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. Acetaminophen the main ingredient in the painkiller known by its trade name, Tylenol is the most common drug ingredient in the United States, found in more than 600 medicines, according to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA), a trade group. Each week about 23 percent of American adults (about 52 million people) use a medicine containing acetaminophen, the CHPA reports. In an earlier study, Way and other colleagues found that acetaminophen also blunts positive emotions like joy. Taken together, the two studies suggest there's a lot we need to learn about one of the most popular over-the-counter drugs in the United States. See Also: New technologies can help short circuit chronic pain ""We don't know why acetaminophen is having these effects, but it is concerning,"" said Way, the senior author of the study. ""Empathy is important. If you are having an argument with your spouse and you just took acetaminophen, this research suggests you might be less understanding of what you did to hurt your spouse's feelings."" The researchers conducted two experiments, the first involving 80 college students. At the beginning, half the students drank a liquid containing 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, while the other half drank a placebo solution that contained no drug. The students didn't know which group they were in. After waiting one hour for the drug to take effect, the participants read eight short scenarios in which someone suffered some sort of pain. For example, one scenario was about a person who suffered a knife cut that went down to the bone and another was about a person experiencing the death of his father. Participants rated the pain each person in the scenarios experienced from 1 (no pain at all) to 5 (worst possible pain). They also rated how much the protagonists in the scenarios felt hurt, wounded and pained. Overall, the participants who took acetaminophen rated the pain of the people in the scenarios to be less severe than did those who took the placebo. A second experiment involved 114 college students. As in the first experiment, half took acetaminophen and half took the placebo. In one part of the experiment, the participants received four two-second blasts of white noise that ranged from 75 to 105 decibels. They then rated the noise blasts on a scale of 1 (not unpleasant at all) to 10 (extremely unpleasant). They were then asked to imagine how much pain the same noise blasts would cause in another anonymous study participant. Results showed that, when compared to those who took the placebo, participants who took acetaminophen rated the noise blasts as less unpleasant for themselves - and also thought they would be less unpleasant for others. ""Acetaminophen reduced the pain they felt, but it also reduced their empathy for others who were experiencing the same noise blasts,"" Mischkowski said. In another part of the experiment, participants met and socialized with each other briefly. Each participant then watched, alone, an online game that purportedly involved three of the people they just met. (The other participants weren't actually involved). In the ""game,"" two of the people the participants had met excluded the third person from the activity. Participants were then asked to rate how much pain and hurt feelings the students in the game felt, including the one who was excluded. Results showed that people who took acetaminophen rated the pain and hurt feelings of the excluded student as being not as severe as did the participants who took the placebo. ""In this case, the participants had the chance to empathize with the suffering of someone who they thought was going through a socially painful experience,"" Way said. Don't Miss: Your brain might be hard-wired for altruism ""Still, those who took acetaminophen showed a reduction in empathy. They weren't as concerned about the rejected person's hurt feelings."" While these results had not been seen before, they make sense in the light of previous research, Way said. A 2004 study scanned the brains of people as they were experiencing pain and while they were imagining other people feeling the same pain. Those results showed that the same part of the brain was activated in both cases. ""In light of those results, it is understandable why using Tylenol to reduce your pain may also reduce your ability to feel other people's pain as well,"" he said. The researchers are continuing to study how acetaminophen may affect people's emotions and behavior, Way said. They are also beginning to study another common pain reliever - ibuprofen - to see if it has similar results. Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

Their study in rats, published in the journal eLife, also suggests that using a drug that inhibits estrogen synthesis, called an aromatase inhibitor, may be an effective approach to controlling seizures. See Also: Human stem cell-derived neuron transplants reduce seizures in mice Seizures occur when connected groups of cells in the brain become over-active and fire together. Current treatments work by dampening brain activity generally, which is often effective in controlling seizures, but can also lead to negative side-effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, or difficulty concentrating. As a result, there is a need for new and effective therapies. ""One alternative to current treatments may be to target a factor that promotes activity more selectively during seizures,"" says corresponding author Catherine Woolley. ""Estrogens could play such a role. While most people think of estrogens as being female sex hormones, they are also synthesized in the brains of both males and females where they could influence seizure activity."" To test this idea, the team injected both male and female rats with kainic acid to induce a severe form of seizures known as status epilepticus. This common, life-threatening condition occurs when epileptic fits last too long or follow one another so closely that patients are unable to recover consciousness between them. The researchers found that, in both sexes, seizures stimulate the synthesis of estrogens in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is often involved in these episodes. Each rat was then randomly administered with either a substance without therapeutic action, known as a vehicle, or an aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole or letrozole, the latter of which is already in clinical use for breast cancer. The vehicle-treated rats displayed the expected progression of seizure activity, while the fadrozole and letrozole-treated rats showed much lower activity. This demonstrated that aromatase inhibitors strongly suppressed the escalation of seizures in both sexes, without the need for anti-seizure drugs. Don't Miss: Researchers find an important clue to potential treatments for absence seizures ""As estrogens are known to increase the activity of cells in the hippocampus, estrogen synthesis during seizures could contribute to this activity, making the episodes worse,"" Woolley explains. ""Our findings show that breaking this cycle with aromatase inhibitor therapy may be a novel approach to clinically controlling seizures."" Stephen M. Smith, Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, and Director of Medical Critical Care at the VA Portland Health Care System, adds: ""Building on past work that shows how estrogen increases neuronal activity in a number of ways, this study clearly demonstrates that inhibiting estrogen production suppresses seizures quickly and effectively in a rat model of status epilepticus. ""Given the unacceptably high mortality rate of status epilepticus in humans, these findings are likely to elicit great interest by physicians in the field. They will hopefully also trigger clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of currently available aromatase inhibitors in patients with this condition."" Learn More: Marijuana derivative reduces seizures in people with treatment-resistant epilepsy One concern over this approach is that aromatase inhibition would eliminate the ability of estrogens to protect neuronal structures and function, which could worsen seizure-related damage in the brain. The team investigated this, however, and found no negative effects of fadrozole or letrozole within the hippocampus. ""Further experiments with more detailed analyses of seizure-related neuronal damage are needed to investigate how aromatase inhibition during seizures affects the consequences of these episodes for the brain,"" says Woolley. ""It is also important to understand how exactly seizure activity leads to estrogen synthesis in the brain, how estrogen levels go back down after a seizure, and what other circumstances stimulate brain estrogen synthesis. Answers to these questions will provide context for future drug development."" Note: Material may have been edited for length and content.

See Also: Study findings challenge a scientific principle about amyloid beta When an ultrasonic wave is irradiated in solution with proteins, cavitation bubbles often repeatedly grow and collapse. This group found that these bubbles collect harmless proteins in solution, generating toxic substances whenever they collapse, changing into aggregates. This group also found that this phenomenon became prominent at the frequency of about 30 kHz. It is thought amyloid-  peptides form neurotoxic aggregates in the brain, developing AD. In developing drugs, it's important to identify and create toxic aggregates and explore drug candidates targeting them, but formation of A  aggregates often takes a very long time. Therefore, technology for accelerating the aggregation reaction in low concentrations has been greatly sought after. Accelerating the aggregation reaction of amyloid-  is also important in giving a diagnosis. For early detection of AD, it's effective to evaluate the aggregation capacity of amyloid- . Individuals who have an internal environment in which amyloid-  tends to aggregate have a high risk of developing AD. However, it's difficult to aggregate amyloid-  in the body, so technology for accelerating the aggregation reaction is required. In recent years, it was found that ultrasonic irradiation increases the aggregation reaction of various proteins. Using their own ultrasonic irradiation device, this group explored conditions for enhancing aggregation of amyloid-  by changing acoustic pressure and frequency in solution independently and accurately. Don't Miss: Is the amyloid hypothesis the right path to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease? As a result, this group succeeded in increasing the reaction velocity constant to 1,000 times by optimizing acoustic pressure at a frequency of 30 kHz. Furthermore, this group found out that this acceleration phenomenon was brought on by cavitation bubbles which generate and collapse along with the cycle of ultrasonic waves and succeeded in theoretically reproducing this phenomenon. This group's achievement can be applied to techniques for early diagnosis of AD and demonstrates the conditions for reducing various risks associated with diagnosis and treatment using ultrasonic waves.

They have observed, for example, that stress incurred early in life attenuates neural growth. Now a study in male mice exposed to stress shows that a particular region, the hippocampus, hits many developmental milestones early essentially maturing faster in response to stress. The findings, the first to track and report signs of stress-related early maturation in a brain region throughout mouse development, may lend some neuroscientific credence to the expression that children facing early adversity have to ""grow up too fast."" See Also: Stress resiliency and susceptibility: The neurocircuitry underlying the detrimental effects of chronic stress Lead author Kevin Bath, assistant professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University, said he became curious about whether some brain regions were maturing faster because he and other researchers had made observations in humans and rodents all suggesting that certain traits such as fear-driven learning and memory, sexual development and neural connectivity among some brain regions were accelerated, rather than stunted, after early life stress (ELS). Some of these qualities, particularly memory and emotion regulation, involve the hippocampus. ""There were a number of different indicators that [early maturation] might be happening,"" Bath said. ""We wanted to carefully assess this and look at a number of different markers of not only growth, but also maturation of these animals, and to measure it not only at the behavioral level but also at the neuromolecular level."" The study, co-authored by Brown graduate students Gabriela Manzano-Nieves and Haley Goodwill, appears online in the journal Hormones and Behavior. The experimental stress introduced to the mice in the study was a period of fragmented maternal care a condition comparable to one that might affect a child growing up in an economically challenged, single-parent household, for example. At four days of age, pups and their mothers were moved from standard cages to ones where the materials available to the mother for nest building were inadequate. Food and water remained plentiful, but the mother responded anxiously and would frequently depart to search for anything that might work as nesting material. Pups therefore received less consistent and attentive care from their harried and distracted mothers than experimental controls who were never moved from standard cages. After just a week of exposure to this manipulation (a significant span of time for mice who mature from birth to adulthood in just eight weeks), the mice returned to cages with everything they needed. By then, however, the effects of the ELS were underway. Bath and his co-authors made several measurements in mice aged four to 50 days (when mice reach young adulthood) to track how development in the hippocampus varied between mice with ELS and the unstressed controls. What they found from counting specific populations of cells, to measuring behavior, to gene expression was that the hippocampus appeared to mature significantly faster in the ELS mice during their seven weeks from birth to early adulthood. Related: Nurturing during preschool years boosts child s brain Based upon measures of gene expression and counting cells, the team saw that parvalbumin interneurons developed about a week early, attaining an abundance by day 21 in ELS mice that was not seen in control mice until day 28. In other measurements, the teams saw that developmental changes in synaptic receptor subunits that are important for developmental changes in learning occurred about nine days ahead of schedule. They also found that myelination, a key developmental process for neural communication, also started more than a week early. They also looked at a behavioral trait controlled by the hippocampus. Mice can be conditioned to associate shocks with a particular location, such that they will freeze in fear when they come back to that place. But for about a week during the maturation of the hippocampus, that freezing behavior temporarily disappears, Bath has found. In the new study, he saw that this was still the case, but the temporary suspension of the fear response happened a week earlier in ELS mice than in control mice. Also, in their study, the team confirmed the findings of previous researchers showing overall reduced neural growth. The results showing reduced growth but faster hippocampus maturation appear to support an evolution-based hypothesis that mice and perhaps people, too interpret ELS as a cue to adapt brain development to match a world where long-term survival seems unlikely, Bath said. ""In the case of development, the stress may be providing a signal about the hospitability of the environment,"" Bath said. Rather than invest for the long run in optimally refined systems in the cortex for learning rules and suppressing emotional responses, mice may instead invest in accelerating the maturation of more primal systems, such as the hippocampus, to support short-term priorities. The priority, Bath speculates, becomes racing to survive long enough to reproduce at least once. ""The evolutionary push is for you to pass on your genes,"" Bath said. ""We hypothesize that stress drives a reallocation of developmental resources from development of the full brain to development of limbic structures that are important for reproduction."" Learn More: 'Trigger' for stress processes discovered in brain To know for sure and to get hints about how mental health practitioners can help people who have experienced early life stress much more work is needed, Bath said. He's pursuing several lines of research including studying female mice, given observations that females are twice as prone as males to develop problems in response to stress, and that human girls who have experienced early life stress undergo menarche earlier. He's also tracking the behavioral implications of accelerated maturational traits (e.g. the early abundance of parvalbumin interneurons), measuring whether maturation is accelerated or delayed in other areas in the brain, and looking at the genetic mechanisms underlying the accelerated maturation to understand why some humans are resilient to ELS exposure.

""Interception! Drew Brees threw the ball right into the opposing linebacker's hands! Like he didn't even see him!"" The quarterback likely actually did not see the defender standing right in front of him, said Dobromir Rahnev, a psychologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Rahnev leads a research team making new discoveries about how the brain organizes visual perception, See Also: Novel therapeutic procedure helps stroke patient recover three-dimensional vision including how it leaves things out even when they're plainly in sight. Rahnev and researchers from the University of California, Berkeley have come up with a rough map of the frontal cortex's role in controlling vision. They have published their findings in the journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The frontal cortex is often seen as our ""thinking cap,"" the part of the brain scientists associate with thinking and making decisions. But it's not commonly connected with vision. ""Some people believe that the frontal cortex is not involved,"" said Rahnev, an assistant professor at the School of Psychology. The new research adds to previous evidence that it is, he said. The lack of association with that part of the brain may have to do with the fact it's other parts that transform information coming from the eyes into sight and others still that make sense of it by doing things like identifying objects in it. But the thinking cap of the brain controls and oversees this whole process, making it as essential to how we see as those other areas, Rahnev said. How that works also accounts for why we sometimes miss things right in front of us. ""We feel that our vision is like a camera, but that is utterly wrong,"" Rahnev said. ""Our brains aren't just seeing, they're actively constructing the visual scene and making decisions about it."" Sometimes the frontal cortex isn't expecting to see something, so although it's in plain sight, it blots it out of consciousness. To test out the fontal cortex's involvement in vision, the researchers ran a two-part experiment. First, they observed which regions of the brain in particular the frontal cortex lit up with activity while healthy volunteers completed visual tasks corresponding to three basic stages of conscious visual perception. Second, they inhibited those same regions using magnetic stimulation to confirm their involvement in each visual stage. The first stage of the visual perception the researchers tested for was selection, Rahnev said. That's when the brain picks out part of the vast array of available visual stimuli to actually pay attention to. In the case of the football quarterback, this might mean focusing on the route the receiver takes. The second stage is combination, he said. The brain merges the visual information it processed with other material. ""The quarterback's brain is putting what he actually sees together with expectations based on the play he called,"" Rahnev said. Then comes evaluation. The quarterback needs to decide whether to release the ball given everything he has processed. Expecting a blocker to stop the defending player (which didn't happen), he may have blotted him out of perception and thrown the ball right at him. Interception. ""The frontal cortex sends a signal to move your attention onto the object you select,"" Rahnev said. ""It does some of the combining with other information, and then it's probably the primary evaluator of what you think you saw."" Researcher Dobromir Rahnev demonstrates the application of temporary magnetic stimulation in a Georgia Tech psychology research center with graduate student Ji-Won Jung. This type of stimulation was used at the University of California, Berkeley for experiments on the frontal cortex's role in creating vision. Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech  In experiments, during a functional MRI (fMRI) scan, different parts of the frontal cortex of the participants lit up, corresponding to each vision function. he back of the frontal cortex activated during selection; its midsection lit up during combination, and the front, or anterior, part cranked up during evaluation. That's how the researchers arrived at a kind of vision map of the frontal cortex. ""It's a rudimentary map,"" Rahnev said. ""A very simple one that just says, 'This is the back. This in the middle. This is the front.'"" The critical evidence for this map came from the use of magnetic stimulation. When the researchers used it to inhibit the back and middle of the frontal cortex separately, subjects became less able to complete the corresponding functions of selection and combination. Don't Miss: At the edge of vision: Struggling to make sense of our cluttered world When they stimulated the front, the opposite happened. Subjects were slightly but significantly better able to evaluate the accuracy of what they think they saw. ""This is a really clear demonstration of the role that the frontal cortex, which is usually seen as the seat of thought, plays in controlling vision."" And there is a practical takeaway for health and safety. Instead of the quarterback telling the coach, ""I swear I didn't see that coming,"" often it's motorists telling police officers the same thing after a car accident. Distraction is often the culprit, because it overtaxes the organization of perception, Rahnev said. These three functions are going on all the time in multiple scenarios in our brains while it processes the world around us. But add too much to the pile, like texting behind the wheel, Rahnev said, and ""you can run right into a parked car without ever seeing it.""

The study may shed new light on the cellular causes of dementia. The work was directed by the University of Bonn and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). It is being published in the journal Neuron. Because of its shape, the control center of memory bears the poetic name of  hippocampus  (seahorse). New sensations to be stored continually enter this region of the brain. But at the same time, the hippocampus is also the guardian of memories: It retrieves stored information from the depths of memory. See Also: Electric current to brain boosts memory The hippocampus is also an important transport junction. And just like rush hour in a major city, it also needs a regulating hand to control the opposing flows of information. The researchers from Bonn, Los Angeles and Palo Alto have now identified such a memory traffic policeman. Certain cells in the brain, the hippocampal astrocytes, ensure that the new information is given priority. The mind thus switches into memorization mode; by contrast, the already saved memories must wait. However, the astrocytes themselves only take orders: They react to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released in particular in novel situations. It has been known for several years that acetylcholine promotes the storage of new information. How this happens has only been partly understood.  In our work, we were able to show for the first time that acetylcholine stimulates astrocytes which then are induced to release the transmitter glutamate,  explains Milan Pabst, who is a doctoral candidate at the Laboratory for Experimental Epileptology of the University of Bonn.  The released glutamate then activates inhibitory nerve cells which inhibit a pathways mediating the retrieval of memories.  The researchers working with the neuroscientist Prof. Dr. Heinz Beck genetically modified nerve cells so that they could be activated by light and then release acetylcholine. Using this trick, they were able to clarify the mechanism using recordings in living brain tissue sections.  However, we also show that, in the brains of living mice, acetylcholine has the same effect on the activity of the neurons,  explains Pabst s colleague, Dr. Holger Dannenberg. Another reason this result is interesting is because astrocytes themselves are not nerve cells. They belong to what are known as glial cells. Until the turn of the millennium, they were still considered to merely serve as mechanical support to the real stars of the brain, the neurons. Learn More: Researchers switch emotion linked to memory In recent decades, however, it has become increasingly clearer that this image is far from correct. It is known by now that astrocytes can release neurotransmitters or even remove them from the brain.  It was previously unknown that the astrocytes are involved in central memory processes through the mechanism which has now been discovered,  explains Prof. Beck. However, an observation made by US scientists in 2014 fits into this context: If astrocytes  function is inhibited, this has a negative effect on the recognition of objects. The results may also shed new light on the cellular causes of memory disorders. Thus there are indications that the controlled secretion of acetylcholine is disrupted in patients with Alzheimer s dementia.  However, we have not investigated whether the mechanism we discovered is also impacted,  stresses Pabst. University of Bonn  press release Pabst M et al.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/carrot-genome-uncovered-189820,Carrot Genome Uncovered Carrot genome paints picture of domestication  could help improve crops  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Sometimes, the evolutionary history of a species can be found in a fossil record. Other times, rocks and imprints must be swapped for DNA and genetic fingerprints. The latter is the case for the good-for-your-eyes carrot, a top crop whose full genetic code was just deciphered by a team of researchers led by University of Wisconsin Madison horticulture professor and geneticist Phil Simon. Simon is also a research scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Agricultural Research Service, which helped fund the work. The study is published in the journal Nature Genetics. It tells a story of how the carrot has been touched by domestication and breeding practices and influenced by environmental and geologic change, and it fills in a family tree of relatives that otherwise appear distinct. It also reveals how carrots have become so good at accumulating carotenoids, the pigment compounds that give them their characteristic colors and provide them with their nutritional strength.  The carrot has a good reputation as a crop and we know it s a significant source of nutrition   vitamin A, in particular,  Simon says.  Now, we have the chance to dig deeper and it s a nice addition to the toolbox for improving the crop.  The knowledge gained from the study could also lead to the improvement of similar crops, from parsnip to the yellow-fleshed cassava, a staple food throughout much of Africa.  This was an important public-private project, and the genomic information has already been made available to assist in improving carrot traits such as enhanced levels of beta-carotene, drought tolerance and disease resistance,  says co-author Allen Van Deynze, director of research at the University of California, Davis  Seed Biotechnology Center.  Going forward, the genome will serve as the basis for molecular breeding of the carrot.  Carrots have a long history as a domesticated root crop. The first cultivated carrots appeared 1,100 years ago in Central Asia. These carrots were   unlike their white wild ancestors   purple and yellow. The canonical orange carrot appeared later, in Europe in the 1500s, providing at the time an aesthetic subject for German and Spanish art. Even before domestication, wild carrot seeds showed up in 3,000- to 5,000-year-old primitive campsites in Germany and Switzerland. The study cannot answer why the first crops were purple and yellow, though it can verify that it is not because of flavor. The genes for color and the genes associated with preferred flavors are not connected. But that colored carrots became popular is fortuitous: The pigments are what make them nutritious, and orange carrots are the most nutritious of all, Simon says. Carrots are the richest crop source of vitamin A in the American diet. The new study reveals how that orange color happens.  The accumulation of orange pigments is an accumulation that normally wouldn t happen,  says Simon, one of just a few carrot researchers around the world, along with another UW Madison scientist, Irwin Goldman, who was not part of this study.  Now, we know what the genes are and what they do.  The research team used the Nantes carrot   a bright orange form of the vegetable named for a city in France   to assemble and analyze the full genetic sequence, peering into the machinery that drove the carrot s evolution, and the bread crumbs left through time. The carrot genome contains more than 32,000 genes arranged among nine chromosomes, which code for pest and disease resistance, colorful carotenoids and more. Carotenoids, like alpha- and beta-carotene, were first discovered in carrots. The researchers uncovered features traced to distantly related plant species, from grapes and tomatoes to kiwis and potatoes. Carrots more recently split from lettuce and they are in the same family as spice crops, like parsley and fennel. The researchers also sequenced 35 different types of carrots to compare them to their wild ancestors. They showed carrots were first domesticated in the Middle East and Central Asia, confirming the Vavilov Center of Diversity theory, which predicts cultivated plants arose from specific regions rather than randomly. They also learned that sometime between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods   roughly around the time dinosaurs went extinct   carrots picked up genetic advantages common to other plants of the era that allowed them to thrive. Additionally, the study confirmed a gene called Y is responsible for the difference between white carrots and yellow or orange ones, and that a variation of it leads to the accumulation of carotenoids.  They could keep their crops  clean  from a patch of wild carrots growing 50 meters away by choosing only the purple or yellow ones. Or maybe it was the food fad of the 10th century   Phil Simon But it also identified a new, previously unknown gene that contributes to the accumulation of the colorful compounds. Both genes are recessive, which means two copies of each are needed for carotenoids to build up in the plant, which is actually a defect in a metabolic pathway that appears to be related to light-sensing. Plants derive their own nutrition through light-sensing, or photosynthesis, but roots like carrots aren t normally exposed to light and do not need photosynthetic pigments like carotenoids.  It s a repurposing of genes plants usually use when growing in light,  says Simon. It appears these genes were inadvertently selected for by early growers, and Simon suggests it may have simply been to aid early domesticators   likely to have been women   differentiate between wild carrots and the plants they intended to grow.  They could keep their crops  clean  from a patch of wild carrots growing 50 meters away by choosing only the purple or yellow ones,  says Simon, who jokes:  Or maybe it was the food fad of the 10th century, with orange in the 16th.  Global carrot consumption quadrupled between 1976 and 2013 and over the last 40 years, breeding has led to more nutritious carrots with the selection of ever more intensely orange crops. In fact, carrots have 50 percent more carotene today than they did in 1970. While most Americans are not deficient in vitamin A, it is considered an essential nutrient and deficiency is a problem in some U.S. communities and around the world. While the study may not solve the problem, it does highlight the opportunity carrots present to improve health and economic outcomes in other nations.  Globally, we hand out vitamin A capsules, but why not have people grow their own?  Simon asks.  In one square meter you can grow a single crop of carrots per year to feed up to a half dozen adults. You can grow half now and half in six months to give you a sustainable source of vitamin A and a valuable crop in the marketplace.  The study also reflects a shift in how plant breeders operate, by taking advantage of new technologies to answer basic questions about cultivated crops.  It tells us things about the genome we expected but didn t know before,  says Simon.  Each crop has a story to tell.  The study also includes co-authors from Michigan State University and around the world, including Poland, Spain, Italy, Turkey, China and Argentina. It was funded by several seed companies and the carrot industry, as well as the National Science Foundation, the Polish National Science Center and the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. The authors declare no competing financial interests and Simon explains that industry funds make the work possible.","Published: May 10, 2016"

The interim analysis shows that a combination of CyTuVax s HBAI20 adjuvant and a standard vaccine induced protective anti-Hepatitis B titres after only 2 vaccinations in 60% of true non-responders. This promising result will be extended in a Phase II study in a larger group of true non-responders. The data of the phase I trial will be published in Q3, 2016. The Hepatitis B HBAI20 vaccine is intended to fulfill a high unmet medical need among persons requiring protective titres against hepatitis B, such as in a medical profession or for travel purposes. True non-responders have received at least 6 vaccinations with a standard vaccine but failed to build up sufficient immune protection against hepatitis B. The trial is conducted at the Ease Travel Clinic by the Department of Medical Microbiology of the MAASTRICHT UMC and coordinated by Dr. A.M. L. Oude Lashof, MD PhD, Internist and Consultant Infectious Diseases of Maastricht UMC. The trialThe study consists of 3 groups of subjects: 10 true non-responders (no protective anti-Hepatitis B titres after 6 Hepatitis B vaccinations) that were vaccinated with HBAI20 (CyTuVax s AI20 adjuvant added to HBVaxPro-10  g), 12 nai ve subjects (volunteers who have never received a hepatitis B vaccination before) that were vaccinated with HBAI20 and 12 nai ve subjects that were vaccinated with HBVaxPro 10  g. Currently, all subjects have been vaccinated twice. In the non-responders group, 60 days after the first vaccination and 30 days after the second vaccination, 60% had protective antibody titres. The adverse events and adverse reactions reported after the first and second vaccination with HBAI20 experimental vaccine were of the number and scale expected for a vaccine and comparable to the HBVaxPro-10 g. There were no serious adverse events reported. The immunogenicity of the HBAI20 is comparable with the immunogenicity of the HBVaxPro-10 g in healthy subjects. Interim resultsThis interim analysis shows that the combined AI20/HBVaxPro vaccination induced protective anti- Hepatitis B titres after 2 vaccinations in 60% of true non-responders.

(MTI) has signed a multi-million dollar exclusive licensing and distribution agreement with Atlantic Diagnostic Laboratories, LLC (ADL) for its flagship product, PolypDx , a urine-based diagnostic test for detection of adenomatous polyps, the precursor to colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death in North America with over 157,000 new cases reported in 2015 alone. With early detection in the adenomatous polyp stage, this form of cancer is preventable. Currently, only 39% of colorectal cancer cases in the United States are diagnosed at an early and treatable stage resulting in a five-year survival rate of 63.5%. The introduction of PolypDx  hopes to change those statistics. PolypDx  gives doctors a new tool in the prevention of colorectal cancer. In a Canadian-based clinical trial of nearly 1,000 patients, MTI's PolypDx  demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity than current fecal-based screening tests to detect adenomatous polyps. Once screened, patients presenting a risk of adenomatous polyps can be directed to a colonoscopy, during which the adenomatous polyps can be completely and safely removed, thus preventing the progression into colorectal cancer. PolypDx  is a simple and effective test requiring only a small urine sample. Early detection and ease of use are key distinguishing factors for a screening test in the prevention of colorectal cancer. The exclusive, three and a half year, multi-million dollar licensing and distribution agreement signed between MTI and ADL provides a valuable entry point into the U.S. market. Initially, PolypDx  will be available across twelve eastern states through existing distribution channels with the ability to grow distribution across the United States. ""The partnership and collaboration between MTI and Atlantic Diagnostic Laboratories will provide the opportunity for patients to access a simple and accurate test with proven capacity to detect adenomatous colonic polyps and thereby prevent colon cancer,"" said Dr. Richard Fedorak, President of MTI. ""ADL, with its extensive LC/MS/MS expertise, has long awaited a high-quality partner such as MTI,"" said Aaron Domenico, Chief Operating Officer of ADL.

The vaccine, known as the PfSPZ Vaccine, was developed and produced by Sanaria Inc., of Rockville, Maryland, with support from several Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. NIAID researchers and collaborators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, conducted the clinical evaluation of the vaccine, which involved immunization and exposing willing healthy adults to the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) in a controlled setting. The parasites that cause malaria are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. The PfSPZ Vaccine is composed of live, but weakened P. falciparum sporozoites   the early developmental form of the parasite. Previous research showed the PfSPZ Vaccine to be highly protective three weeks after immunization. In this trial, researchers assessed if protection could last for five months to a year.  Malaria remains one of the most devastating diseases in the world, especially among young children in Africa,  said NIAID director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  A malaria vaccine that provides long-term protection is urgently needed to reduce mortality and eliminate transmission. This study is an encouraging step forward in our goal to control and ultimately eradicate malaria.  The Phase 1 trial took place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and at the University of Maryland Medical Center and enrolled 101 healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years who had never had malaria. Of these volunteers, 59 received the PfSPZ Vaccine; 32 participants served as controls and were not vaccinated. Vaccine recipients were divided into several groups to assess the roles of the route of administration, dose, and number of immunizations in conferring short- and long-term protection against malaria. To determine if the number of immunizations influenced protection, vaccinated participants received either three (nine participants) or four (28 participants) intravenous (IV) immunizations of the PfSPZ Vaccine at a higher dose than tested in previous human studies. To compare the protective efficacy of different routes of administration, eight participants received four immunizations via intramuscular injection (IM) at a dose approximately 10-fold higher than the dose administered intravenously. This was done to help the research team assess if IV administration was necessary and more efficient based on the dose required. To evaluate how well the PfSPZ Vaccine prevented malaria infection, all participants   including the control participants who were not vaccinated   were exposed at varying times to the bites of mosquitoes carrying the same P. falciparum strain from which the PfSPZ Vaccine was derived. The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, carried out this controlled human malaria infection procedure a standard process in early phase malaria vaccine trials. To assess short-term protection, participants were exposed to the bites of parasite-infected mosquitoes three weeks after receiving their final vaccination. Scientists then took blood samples from each participant to measure parasite levels for evidence of protection. For nine participants who received three IV doses, three were protected, or had no detectable parasites in their blood. For the nine participants who received four IV doses, seven were protected. Only three of the eight participants who received four IM doses were protected, indicating that IV administration afforded higher levels of protection at a lower dose. To assess long-term protection, an additional group of 11 participants received four IV doses of the investigational vaccine and were exposed to the bites of malaria parasite-infected mosquitoes 21 weeks after their final vaccination. Scientists found that six of 11 participants (55 percent) had no detectable parasites in their blood after this exposure. Four of these six participants, plus one of the participants who received the same four doses via IV and had no parasites in the blood after exposures at three weeks and 21 weeks, were exposed to mosquito bites again at 59 weeks after their final vaccination. All five participants exposed at 59 weeks did not develop parasites in their blood, while all six unvaccinated control participants became infected with malaria parasites. Collectively, the data showed that the PfSPZ Vaccine provided malaria protection for more than one year in 55 percent of people without prior malaria infection. In those individuals, the PfSPZ Vaccine appeared to confer sterile protection, meaning the individuals would be protected against disease and could not further transmit malaria. The vaccinations were also well-tolerated among participants, and there were no serious adverse events attributed to vaccination. Additional results showed that antibodies may play a role in malaria protection early after the final immunization, but inducing T cells in the liver is likely necessary for durable protection.  It is now clear that administering the PfSPZ Vaccine intravenously confers long-term, sterile protection in a small number of participants, which has not been achieved with other current vaccine approaches,  said Robert A. Seder, M.D., chief of the Cellular Immunology Section of NIAID s Vaccine Research Center and principal investigator of the trial.  Based on the favorable safety profile, we re testing higher doses in larger trials to see if even greater protection can be achieved long-term against other P. falciparum strains different than the vaccine strain.  Long-term, reliable protection is important for people who are vaccinated but not exposed to malaria for months, such as travelers and military personnel. Durable protection is also important for mass vaccination campaigns in malaria-endemic regions aimed at interrupting transmission, according to the authors. NIAID conducts and supports research   at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide   to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.","Published: May 10, 2016"

The findings, published in the journal Diabetes, March 2016, may fuel the development of new therapies targeting these diseases. The molecular mechanisms that trigger the development of obesity and diabetes are still the subject of ongoing research. For example, limited information exists regarding the role of adhesion molecules in fat tissues   cell surface proteins that help cells stick to their surroundings or to each other. Scientists believe adhesion molecules may affect the build-up of excess fat during obesity. One such molecule, ACAM (adipocyte adhesion molecule), has been found on the surface of fat cells (or adipocytes) in rats, mice and humans, but its functional role remains unclear. Now, Jun Wada and co-workers at Okayama University, Japan, have shown that transgenic mice engineered to express high levels of ACAM appear to be protected from developing obesity and diabetes. The researchers generated mouse lines capable of higher levels of ACAM expression than wild-type mice. They engineered three groups of mice to express varying levels of ACAM expression driven varying promoter activities of  aP2    an adipocyte fatty acid binding prptein. Fluorescent tagging also allowed the team to monitor how ACAM behaved, and how it influenced other molecules inside the body. Wada s team fed the mice on a high fat, high sugar diet. They found that, in the group with the highest levels of ACAM, the mice appeared to be completely protected from obesity and diabetes. ACAM was abundantly expressed on mature adipocyte plasma membranes, and interacted with two further molecules, myosin II-A and  -actin. These interactions facilitated the formation of so-called  zonula adheren  structures on the cell surface. The researchers believe the zonula adherens may increase the mechanical strength of the adipocyte cell surface, restricting increases in cell volume and the accumulation of fat cells. The resulting alterations in molecular signalling may also improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. In their paper published in May 2016 in Diabetes, Wada s team hold great hopes for their results:  Our finding provides new therapeutic modalities targeting the processes of cell adhesion and actin polymerization of adipocytes in the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

Both lactose intolerance and schizophrenia are inherited. In addition, neither condition emerges in the first years of life, but rather both appear years or even decades later, says senior author Dr. Arturas Petronis, head of the Krembil Family Epigenetics Laboratory in the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). See Also: Schizophrenia-associated genetic variants affect gene regulation in the developing brain The study, published in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, showed that a combination of genetics and epigenetics factors that turn genes on or off could explain how lactose intolerance develops over time. These basic principles can be applied to the study of more complex mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or Alzheimer's disease. All these conditions also have DNA risk factors but take decades before clinical symptoms develop, says Dr. Petronis, who also is the Tapscott Chair in Schizophrenia Studies at the University of Toronto. More than 65 percent of adults worldwide are lactose intolerant and cannot process the milk sugar lactose. Lactose intolerance is influenced by one gene, which determines if a person will lose the ability to process lactose over time. More specifically, those with some variants of this gene will gradually produce less lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose, as they age. ""The question we asked is why does this change happen over time? All newborns are able to digest lactose, independently from their genetic variation,"" says Dr. Petronis. ""Now, we know that epigenetic factors accumulate at a very different pace in each person, depending on the genetic variants of the lactase gene."" Over time, these epigenetic changes build up and inactivate the lactase gene in some but not all individuals. At this point, these individuals would start experiencing symptoms of lactose intolerance. Don't Miss: Working to loosen the grip of severe mental illness Unravelling the epigenetic control of the lactase gene involved a collaborative effort of CAMH, University of Toronto, the Hospital for Sick Children, Vilnius University and the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. Mental illnesses are much more complex, and many more genes with their epigenetic ""surroundings"" are implicated. But in essence, the same molecular mechanisms may account for the delayed age of onset of illnesses, such as schizophrenia, in early adulthood, says Dr. Petronis. The combination of genes and epigenetic factors that build up over time with age, provide a plausible avenue to investigate in illnesses such as schizophrenia.

A small brain structure plays a central role in the many decisions like this we make each day. But it hasn't been clear how a limited number of neurons in this small part of the brain can support an unlimited number of choices. See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making Now, studying how macaque monkeys choose between juice drinks, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found that some of the neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) assign value to the options, while other neurons are related to making final choices. All of these neurons can re-map to make different decisions when circumstances change. The researchers report their findings in the journal Nature Neuroscience. In previous research, Camillo Padoa-Schioppa, PhD, an associate professor of neuroscience and the study's senior investigator, identified different groups of cells in the OFC. ""When we choose between an apple and a banana, some neurons assign a value to the apple, some neurons assign a value to the banana, and other neurons represent the choice outcome,"" he said. ""Taken together, these different groups of cells seem to form a neural circuit that generates economic decisions."" In this study, the researchers examined how this neural circuit reorganizes when decisions are made in different circumstances. During the experiments, Padoa-Schioppa and first author Jue Xie, a graduate student in Padoa-Schioppa's lab, used a dozen different juice drinks. In each tasting session, the macaques chose between two different drinks. Subsequently, they chose between two other juice drinks. ""An animal first might choose between grape juice and apple juice, and some neurons would represent the value of the grape juice,"" said Xie. ""Later, the animal might choose between kiwi punch and peach juice, and the same neurons that had assigned a value to the grape juice subsequently would assign a value to the kiwi punch. This means there is no such thing as a grape juice cell or an apple juice cell. The neurons become associated with one of the options available at any given time."" Added Padoa-Schioppa, who also is an associate professor of economics and of biomedical engineering: ""Think about the choices we make on a given day -- between foods, whether to watch TV or read a book, or between different investments in our retirement funds. Some cells in the orbitofrontal cortex assign values to individual options, and other cells represent the choice outcome. Neurons that assign the value to individual options are called offer-value cells. But if we are choosing between different foods, an offer-value cell might represent the value of roasted chicken, whereas if we are choosing between different financial investments, the same offer-value cell might represent the value of a mutual fund."" Although individual neurons re-map to represent the value of different options, the overall organization of the neural circuit remains stable, the researchers said. Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisions ""In our study, the functional role of each neuron remained the same,"" said Xie. ""Offer-value cells always represented the value of one of the options while neurons representing the choice outcome always represented the choice outcome, independently of which juice drinks were involved in a decision."" The researchers also noted that two neurons associated with the same juice drink in the first set of the macaques' decisions also were associated with the same juice drink in a second set of choices. ""If we look at individual cells, neurons are very flexible,"" said Padoa-Schioppa. ""However, if we consider the whole network, the decision circuit is remarkably stable. This combination of circuit stability and neuronal flexibility makes it possible for the same brain region to generate decisions between any two goods.""

Testing a multi-step therapeutic strategy, the scientists found a way to use a gene therapy to shut down a gene long-implicated in the formation of high-grade gliomas called Olig2. The protein encoded by Olig2 is expressed in the majority of gliomas. Removing the Olig2 gene halts tumor growth, while elimination of Olig2-producing cells blocks tumor formation. See Also: Gene sequencing project uncovers mutations tied to deadly pediatric high-grade glioma brain tumors ""We find that elimination of dividing Olig2-expressing cells blocks initiation and progression of glioma in animal models and further show that Olig2 is the molecular arbiter of genetic adaptability that makes high-grade gliomas aggressive and treatment resistant,"" said Qing Richard Lu, PhD, lead investigator and scientific director of the Brain Tumor Center at Cincinnati Children's. ""By finding a way to inhibit Olig2 in tumor forming cells, we were able to change the tumor cells' makeup and sensitize them to targeted molecular treatment. This suggests a proof of principle for stratified therapy in distinct subtypes of malignant gliomas."" The current study may apply to high-grade brain gliomas and a fatal brainstem tumor called DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), which expresses Olig2 and is inoperable because of its location in a brain region controlling vital functions. Even if these cancers do initially respond to a specific targeted treatment, they adapt by finding genetic/molecular workarounds, evade treatment and continue growing. Researchers caution the experimental therapeutic approach they describe requires extensive additional research and remains years away from possible clinical testing. Still, Dr. Lu said the data are a significant research breakthrough. The current study finds a potential chink in the molecular armor of these stubborn cancers that even after an initial round of successful treatment almost always relapse and kill the patients who get them. Related: New combination treatment strategy to 'checkmate' glioblastoma The cancers form from precursors of supporting brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help generate insulation for neural connections. Olig2 appears at the early stages of brain cell development. Through extensive analysis of human brain cancer cells and mouse models, the researchers observed Olig2 expression in early-stage dividing and replicating cells in tumors. Olig2 contributes to the transformation of normal precursor cells into abnormal malignant cells that divide uncontrollably. In the context of cancer cell formation, the researchers saw Olig2 drive molecular processes that allow forming glioma cells to be highly adaptable and susceptible to the tumor-promoting effects of additional genetic changes. Researchers then decided to eliminate Olig2-positive dividing cells during tumor formation. To use an approach more rapidly translatable from the laboratory bench to clinical bedside, they successfully tested a gene therapy that uses an engineered herpes simplex virus (viral vector) to deliver a suicide gene into replicating Olig2-positive cancer cells. They next administered an anti-herpes drug already in clinical use, ganciclovir. The Olig2-deleted tumors were not able to grow. Researchers also found that after Olig2 was inhibited, the forming brain cancer cells switched directions and molecular composition- going from the cells resembling oligodendrocyte precursors to assume astrocyte-like brain cell characteristics. They continued to form tumors, however these newly formed astrocyte-like brain cancer cells produce the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene at high levels. Learn More: Longer telomeres linked to risk of brain cancer EGFR is a common and effective target for chemotherapy drugs used clinically to treat tumors such as breast cancers. In repeated tests in mouse models, Olig2 inhibition prompted the glioma-forming cells to transform into EGFR-expressing astrocyte-like cells. Then, in subsequent and repeated testing on the transformed human and mouse model astrocyte-like cancer cells, the researchers treated the cells with an EGFR-targeted chemotherapy drug called gefitinib. The treatment stopped the growth of new tumor cells and tumor expansion. Dr. Lu said that with additional testing, verification and refinement the experimental therapy could be especially helpful in preventing a recurrence of brain cancer in patients who have undergone an initial round of successful treatment. He added the new treatment approach would likely be used in combination with other existing therapies like radiation, surgery, other chemotherapies and targeted molecular treatments. The scientists continue their research with additional testing in human cell lines and ""humanized"" mouse models of high-grade glioma. The mouse models are engineered to grow brain tumors derived from the tumor cells of specific patients whose families have donated biopsy samples for research. This allows researchers to test different targeted drugs in their therapeutic protocol that may best match the genetic makeup of tumors from specific individuals.Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Lu F et al.

The review summarizes the capability and capacity of all cell and gene therapy manufacturing facilities in the UK that hold an MHRA-licence. The survey, initiated in 2013 has continued annually following a recommendation by the UK government House of Lords 2013-14 Regenerative Medicine report. The report highlights a number of key changes in the cell and gene therapy manufacturing landscape over the last 12 months, including:  A continued increase in the number of GMP manufacturing facilities; 22 facilities in 2016, rising from 18 in 2015 and 13 in 2014. Of this increase, 3 are gene therapy manufacturing facilities and an additional facility in cell therapy. An increase in the number of people employed across UK cell and gene therapy manufacturers by a further 20% - from 324 to 391. An increased geographical spread of facilities throughout the UK. New additions for 2016 were based in London, Glasgow, Oxford and Birmingham. A 9% increase in total clean room footprint for cell therapy facilities, now totalling nearly 1900m2, whilst gene therapy clean room footprint almost trebled to more than 2400m2.  Ensuring our manufacturing capability and capacity is continuing to grow is critical to the further development of a world leading cell and gene therapy industry for the UK. This is why we were asked by Government to produce these annual reviews, to ensure we are on track,  said Keith Thompson, CEO at the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult.  The data in the 2016 report shows growth across all the markers that we analyse and forecasts a considerable increase again in the next 12 months. The opening of our own 7,200m2 cell and gene therapy facility in the UK next year will provide a step change to the UKs manufacturing offering that will help deliver revolutionary treatments for patients and assist companies to develop manufacturing in the UK.   The UK is making fantastic progress in manufacturing cell and gene therapies and shown great foresight by developing the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult. It is vital that the UK has the capacity and skills needed to stay globally competitive in advanced therapy manufacturing,  said Ian McCubbin, SVP North America, Japan & Global Pharma Supply, GSK and chair of the Medicines Manufacturing Industry Partnership (MMIP).  The newly formed MMIP Advanced Therapy Manufacturing Taskforce, co-chaired by myself and George Freeman, Minister for Life Sciences, aims to build on this success and anchor the manufacturing and associated supply chain of advanced therapy products here in the UK.

This work, which appeared online today in Cell, sheds light on the development and function of a cell type that is increasingly recognized as having an important role in the body's immune defense. NIAMS is part of the National Institutes of Health. ""Up until now, researchers have focused on T cells -- another type of immune cell,"" said John J. O'Shea, M.D., scientific director of NIAMS and senior author of the paper. ""ILCs are coming into the spotlight because they appear to have a critical role in defending the body's barrier regions, such as the skin, lungs, and gut, where microbes must first pass to make their way into the body."" Our immune system has two arms -- innate and adaptive. ILCs are innate immune cells that respond quickly against pathogens at the first site of invasion. They release small molecules called cytokines that transmit signals to fight infection. The adaptive immune response kicks in more slowly to build an army of cells that can target specific offending pathogens. T cells, especially helper T cells, are a key part of the adaptive immune system. They produce different cytokines depending upon the type of pathogen they are trying to combat. The importance of T cells became apparent during the 1980's with the emergence of HIV and AIDS. HIV attacks a certain class of T cells, destroying a person's immune defenses and leaving him or her susceptible to infection and cancer. Since that time, investigators around the world have identified the distinct functions of T cell subclasses, providing new insights into their roles in host defense and opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies. ILCs have received less attention despite their critical role in mounting the innate immune response. Recent work has revealed that ILCs and T cells mirror each other in their subclasses, which are defined by the kinds of cytokines they produce. However, the relationships between the two types of cells have been unclear. To determine what sets ILCs apart from T cells, Dr. O'Shea's team looked to the foundation of a cell's identity -- its genetic information, which provides detailed instructions for how a cell functions. Part of what makes each cell type unique is its distinctive pattern of DNA structure and regulatory factors. The combination of a stretch of DNA and a set of regulatory factors can be thought of as a switch -- it helps determine whether a gene is turned off (inactive) or on (active). Inactive regions of DNA are twisted into tight coils, whereas active regions are open and accessible to the cellular machinery that reads the genetic information. The open portions of the genome include genes themselves, as well as many regions that contribute to the regulation of their activities (the switches). The areas of the genome and the factors that control whether or not the information is read, in total, are referred to as the cell's regulome. Working in mice, the researchers analyzed regions of the genome that control the cytokine genes produced by both ILCs and T cells. They found that each subclass of ILCs is associated with a distinct pattern of accessible regions. These patterns can be viewed as a type of barcode for each subclass. Further experiments showed that ILCs acquire their barcodes in a stepwise manner over the course of cellular development. Importantly, the analysis showed that the barcodes are in place in ILCs before they encounter infection. This open, accessible configuration surrounding the switches that control cytokine genes may be instrumental in enabling ILCs to rapidly launch an assault upon infection. In contrast, the researchers found that many of the DNA regions controlling cytokine genes in the mice's T cells are inaccessible and silenced prior to exposure to a pathogen. But upon infection, T cells adopted barcodes similar to those of their ILC counterparts. This result reflected earlier findings that ILC and T cell subclasses produce similar sets of cytokines, but also revealed differences in how the two cell types control the activities of these key immune response genes. While the regulatory landscapes of ILCs are primed for a quick defense upon infection, those of T cells are minimally prepared when the pathogen invades. Only following infection are modifications in the landscape made that enable T cells to launch their attack. ""ILCs and T cells appear very different, but in the end, the way they control key responses is amazingly similar,"" said Han-Yu Shih, Ph.D., a post-doctoral fellow at NIAMS and first author of the paper. ""ILCs were discovered less than a decade ago, but the parallels between them and T cells will enable us to more quickly understand how they work and to develop ways to enhance or inhibit their function in treating a variety of immune and inflammatory diseases."" This work was supported by the NIAMS intramural research program under project number ZIA-AR041159. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center also provided support for the study. The mission of the NIAMS, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health, is to support research into the causes, treatment and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases.","Published: May 7, 2016"

Being able to look at nanoscale chemical gradients and reactions as they take place is just such a fundamental tool in biology, chemistry and all of material science,  said Nathan Gianneschi, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry who headed the team that detailed the development in a paper in this week s issue of the journal Microscopy and Microanalysis. With this new tool, we ll be able to look at the kinetics and dynamics of chemical interactions that we ve never been able to see before.  Scientists have long relied on Transmission Electron Microscopy, or TEM, to see structures at the nanoscale. But that technique can take only static images and the subjects must be dried, or frozen and mounted within a vacuum chamber in order to be seen. As a result, researchers have been unable to view living processes or chemical reactions at the nanoscale, such as the growth and contraction within living cells of tiny fibers or nanoscale protrusions, essential in cell movement and division, or the changes caused by a chemical reaction in a liquid.  As chemists, we could only really analyze the end products or bulk solution changes, or image at low resolution because we could never see events directly occur at the nanoscale,  said Gianneschi. Recent developments in Liquid Cell TEM, or LCTEM, have allowed scientists to finally take videos of nanoscale objects in liquids. But that technique has been limited by the inability to control the mixing of solutions, a requirement when trying to view and analyze the impact of a drug on a living cell or the reaction of two chemicals. Joseph Patterson, a postdoctoral researcher in the Gianneschi laboratory, working with SCIENION researchers both in the US and in Germany and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, has taken a big step to resolving that problem by developing a technique as well as a tool that allows scientists to deposit tiny amounts of liquid about 50 trillionths of a liter within the viewing area of the LCTEM microscope  With this technique, we can view multiple components mixed together at the nanoscale within liquids, so, for example, one could look at biological materials and perhaps see how they respond to a drug,  said Gianneschi.  That was never possible before.   The benefits to basic research are huge,  he added.  We will now be able to directly see the growth at the nanoscale of all kinds of things, like natural fibers or microtubules. There s a lot of interest on the part of researchers in understanding how the surfaces of nanoparticles affect chemical reactions or how nanoscale defects on the surfaces of materials develop. We can finally look at the interfaces on nanostructures so that we can optimize the development of new kinds of catalysts, paints and suspensions.

The authors of the study, funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) at the National Institutes of Health, say those outcomes would have been unimaginable about 10 years ago, prior to the drugs  availability. The results were published in the journal Ophthalmology and presented May 2nd at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in Seattle.  This is the most comprehensive study of anti-VEGF therapy for AMD to date,  said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.  It points to the importance of long-term follow-up in studies evaluating disease treatments.  AMD is the leading cause of vision loss among older Americans. It causes damage to the central part of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. AMD often has very few symptoms in its early stages; but in later stages, it causes loss of the central, straight-ahead vision needed for activities like reading and driving. There are two types of late AMD geographic atrophy, and the more common neovascular AMD, also known as wet AMD. In neovascular AMD, fragile blood vessels grow under the retina and leak fluid. This usually starts in one eye, and is stimulated by a protein called VEGF. Just 10 years ago, people diagnosed with neovascular AMD were almost certain to develop severe vision loss in their affected eye and likely to lose vision in their other eye, too. The new study looked at people with AMD who had regular treatment with drugs designed to block VEGF. After five years, 50 percent of them had 20/40 vision or better, 20 percent had 20/200 vision or worse, and the rest were in-between. Ten years ago, the best available treatment for AMD was photodynamic therapy in which an intravenous drug (injected into a vein) and laser are used to seal off leaking blood vessels. Past studies have found that just one year after diagnosis, less than 15 percent of patients given this therapy alone retain 20/40 vision, and up to 40 percent decline to 20/200 vision. Without any treatment, less than 10 percent of patients retain 20/40 vision at one year, and up to 75 percent of untreated patients decline to 20/200 vision. In the U.S., state drivers  licenses generally require 20/40 vision in at least one eye. A best-corrected vision of 20/200 in both eyes is considered legally blind for the purpose of federal disability benefits. The Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) began in 2008 and was designed to compare the anti-VEGF drugs Avastin and Lucentis. VEGF is important in the growth and development of new blood vessels in normal and cancerous tissues. Avastin (bevacizumab) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer. Other drugs were later developed specifically to target blood vessels in the retina, with Lucentis (ranibizumab) coming to the market in 2006 and Eylea (aflibercept) in 2011. For treating AMD, the drugs are injected into the eye. Before Lucentis was available, many ophthalmologists began treating the disease with Avastin, which appeared to have similar benefits, at least in the short-term. The difference in the cost of the drugs also made Avastin appealing; the approximate per-dose price was $50 for Avastin and $2000 for Lucentis. In the trial, more than 1200 participants with neovascular AMD were randomly assigned to receive either Lucentis or Avastin for two years, through monthly or as-needed injections. During that time, the two drugs were equally effective at preserving visual acuity. These results were later confirmed in five multicenter clinical trials around the world. The current study followed up with CATT participants between March 2014 and 2015, an average of 5.5 years after enrollment in the trial. After two years on their assigned drug, participants were free to work with their eye care providers to choose their own course of therapy. During that 3.5-year period, more than half received at least one treatment with a drug or therapy other than the drug assigned to them. The investigators obtained visual acuity measurements for 647 of 914 participants who were still living. In addition to the overall effects of anti-VEGF therapy at five years, the investigators compared the outcomes of participants who received Avastin or Lucentis during the trial.  Some experts had speculated that two years of treatment with ranibizumab might have long-term benefits superior to bevacizumab. However, at five years, there were no differences in visual acuity between the two drugs,  said Daniel F. Martin, M.D., chair of the Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute and CATT study chair. The study also found that after five years, participants assigned to Lucentis during the trial had a higher rate of strokes and heart attacks (7.6 percent) than those assigned to Avastin (4.5 percent). Since most participants received treatments other than their assigned drug after the two year-trial, the investigators are cautious about attributing this difference to the study drugs. Finally, the study provides information on the general course of AMD with treatment. It was already known that many people with neovascular AMD eventually develop geographic atrophy, which has no treatment. In the trial, participants were more likely to develop geographic atrophy when they received monthly, rather than as-needed injections of Avastin or Lucentis. After the trial, almost all participants stopped monthly injections in favor of as-needed treatment, with an average of 4-5 injections per year. By five years, the rate of geographic atrophy increased from 20 percent of participants at two years to 41 percent at five years. The fraction of participants with geographic atrophy was similar between the Avastin and Lucentis groups.  Although anti-VEGF treatment has greatly improved the prognosis for patients overall, we still need to find ways to avoid poor vision in these patients and to decrease the burden of ongoing treatment,  said Maureen G. Maguire, Ph.D., the study s principal investigator and a professor of ophthalmology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.","Published: May 7, 2016"

SFX-01 is a synthetic version of sulforaphane, a known neuroprotective and anti-cancer agent, which is stabilised in a novel patented complex using a proprietary manufacturing process. The Phase II trial, SAS (SFX-01 after Subarachnoid Haemorrhage), is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study comparing oral SFX-01 with placebo. The trial will recruit 90 patients, 45 in each treatment arm with all patients receiving nimodipine, the current standard of care. Patients will be dosed within 48 hours of experiencing SAH and approval has also been obtained in this study to provide for emergency dosing prior to consent. The primary endpoints include safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Nimodipine has been generic for more than 20 years, during which time there have been no significant clinical advances in the treatment of SAH. Whilst SAH is relatively rare, the market potential for this devastating condition, with its high unmet clinical need, is significant. In October 2015, Credit Suisse (commissioned by a US peer) estimated potential peak sales of $1.7bn by 2032 for a Phase III development product based on the intraventricular delivery of a nimodipine-based formulation. SFX-01 potentially represents a new class of drug in aneurysmal SAH with a mechanism of action that specifically targets the Nrf-2 pathway, which in turn reduces the oxidative stress and the toxicity caused by free haemoglobin from the haemorrhage. Sulforaphane, the active ingredient of SFX-01, has been shown to be neuroprotective in multiple models of cerebral damage, including SAH.","Published: May 7, 2016"

The researchers describe online in Nature Materials a new class of technology that provides greater resolution for measuring electrical activity in space and time that matches or exceeds existing methods. See Also: Wireless brain sensor could unchain neuroscience from cables ""Dissolvable silicon electronics offer an unprecedented opportunity to implant advanced monitoring systems that eliminate the risks, cost, and discomfort associated with surgery to extract current devices used for post-operative monitoring,"" said senior co-author Brian Litt, MD, a professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Bioengineering. Litt co-led the study with long-time collaborator John A. Rogers, PhD, a material scientist from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""This study tested the usefulness of temporary, dissolvable monitoring systems capable of providing continuous streams of data for guiding medical care over predetermined periods of time from days to months before dissolving."" The device is made of layers of silicon and molybdenum that can measure physiological characteristics and dissolve at a known rate, as determined by its thickness. For example, the team used the device to record brain waves in rats under anesthesia, as well as voltage fluctuations between neurons (EEGs), and induced epileptic spikes in intact live tissue. A separate experiment demonstrated a complex, multiplexed array made from these materials that could map rat-whisker sensing capabilities at high resolution. These electrophysiological signals were recorded from devices placed at the surface of the brain cortex and the inner space between the scalp and skull. Chronic measurements were made over a 30-day period, while acute experiments demonstrated device operations over three to four hours. Don't Miss: Electrical signals could help repair injured spinal cords The type of neurophysiologic features measured by the new device are commonly used for diagnosing and treating such disorders as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, chronic pain, and conditions of the peripheral nervous system. ""These measurements are critically important for mapping and monitoring brain function during and in preparation for neurosurgery, for assisting in device placement, such as for Parkinson's disease, and for guiding surgical procedures on complex, interconnected nerve structures,"" Litt said. Other applications include post-operative monitoring and recording of physiological characteristic after minimally invasive placement of vascular, cardiac, orthopaedic, neural or other devices. At present, post-operative monitoring is based on clinical examination or interventional radiology, which is invasive, expensive, and impractical for continuous monitoring over days to months. Comparative studies showed that the new sensor performed as well or better relative to conventional electrodes used in the clinic, with regard to tissue reactivity as measured by tissue pathology, as well as cellular and immune staining after the studies' end. The team sees many uses for this new technology. ""We also want to develop this implant to monitor post-operative seizures and recovery of brain function after surgery,"" Litt said. ""Recent evidence suggests that up to three months of intracranial recording may be required to adequately locate seizures before epilepsy surgery or device placement.

Most insects, for whom humidity levels can mean life or death, do have such systems, but little has been known about how they work. Now, a research team from Northwestern University and Lund University in Sweden is the first to discover a sensory system that directly detects air humidity. The scientists have identified key genes involved in the fruit fly's ability to detect changes in external humidity, and they also discovered the sensory neurons the fly's humidity receptors in a strange, small sac in the insect's antennae. See Also: Neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations ""That insects are able to detect humidity levels has been known since the beginning of the 20th century, but how they do it has remained enigmatic,"" said Marcus C. Stensmyr, associate professor at Lund University and co-corresponding author. ""Our study reveals for the first time the genes and neurons that underlie this ability, which is very exciting."" What the researchers have learned about Drosophila melanogaster a major model system for the genetics of behavior could help scientists better understand the mosquito and improve mosquito population control by preventing the insects from finding suitable bodies of water in which to lay their eggs. ""Insects are generally very small, and humidity is a very big deal for them,"" said Marco Gallio, assistant professor of neurobiology in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a co-corresponding author of the study. ""They are careful to not lose moisture, which could cause them to die, and they also use humidity detectors to find water. Our discovery is very important for sensory biology and offers a possible tool for fighting mosquitos and the disease they can carry."" In the finding, published in the journal Current Biology, Stensmyr, Gallio and their colleagues identified the neurons in the antenna that respond to humidity by using a variety of genetic methods. ""Human engineers have devised a few different ways to measure air humidity,"" Gallio said. ""The oldest relies on a human hair under tension. The hair retains moisture, so its length changes with humidity, and that can be easily measured. It turns out the fly may use a very similar strategy to measure humidity: the mechanical deformation of a specialized little organ inside the antenna, called the sacculus, could tell the brain about humidity levels."" Learn More: Switching off brain circuit renders mice  out of touch  with environment The researchers also directly investigated how the fly brain responds to humid stimuli and found that humidity activates a region of the brain right next to the one activated by temperature. ""Yet the fly's response to humidity and temperature are separate, and this may allow the animal to better adapt its behavior to the changing environment,"" Gallio said. Indeed, the researchers believe that understanding how animals detect and respond to environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity also may help scientists better predict what will happen to the distribution and survival of different species under global warming.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/shining-a-light-on-bladder-cancer-209329,Shining A Light On Bladder Cancer Researchers scrutinize patterns of mutations in bladder tumor genomes  gleaning insights into the roles of DNA repair and tobacco related DNA damage  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Over the last several years, research teams across the world have scoured the genomes of cancer cells in a quest to uncover the genes that drive tumor growth. Meticulous analyses of the many thousands of genetic mutations that can accumulate in each tumor s DNA have brought an increasing number of  driver genes  into view. Now, scientists are also turning their attention to another key question: What are the biological processes that lead to these DNA mutations in the first place?  The mutations we see in a patient s tumor are an amalgamation   genetic relics left behind by multiple different processes in the cell,  says Gad Getz, director of Cancer Genome Computational Analysis at the Broad Institute and an associate professor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).  We don t know what those processes are up front, but with sophisticated computational methods, we can now uncover them, and in doing so, gain insights into the biology of different cancers and how they can be more effectively treated.  In this week s issue of Nature Genetics, Getz and his colleagues report the results of a deep analysis of nearly 300 urothelial tumors, a type of bladder cancer responsible for roughly 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. Their work highlights the role of a well-known DNA repair process, known as nucleotide-excision repair (NER) and, for the first time, reveals genomic evidence for the role of tobacco smoking in this form of cancer. Signature searches To retrace the biological steps that lead to genetic mutations in cancer, Getz and other leading cancer genomics experts are studying so-called  mutational signatures    patterns of mutations that are left behind in tumor DNA and reflect different mutation-causing events or exposures. For example, cigarette smoke leaves a characteristic imprint on the genomes of lung cancer cells. This imprint (known as Signature 4 in the COSMIC database), can be uncovered by surveying the genomes of lung tumors through large-scale sequencing, and then harnessing advanced computational algorithms   pioneered by multiple groups, including Getz s team   to reveal the precise arrangement of genetic typos that emerge from continued cigarette use. Similar approaches can reveal mutational signatures tied to other mutagens as well as sloppy housekeeping functions, like DNA maintenance and repair. Although studies of driver genes rely on mutations that land in and around genes (and thus exert substantial biological effects), analyses of mutational signatures cast a wide view, examining mutations that land in any and all parts of the genome, including areas that carry little or no functional consequence.  Here, we really aren t concerned with the driver mutations,  says Getz.  Most of these mutations are passenger mutations that didn t necessarily cause the cancer, but instead were byproducts of the biological forces that led to mutations in the tumor genome.  Signs of impaired repair Getz and his colleagues, including researchers working on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), recently uncovered some intriguing findings related to urothelial cancer. They found that the ERCC2 gene   a core component of the NER pathway   is frequently mutated in urothelial tumors. Importantly, this is the only tumor type found to date in which ERCC2 is significantly mutated beyond what is expected by chance. In addition, Broad and Dana-Farber researcher Eliezer Van Allen and his colleagues revealed an interesting association between ERCC2 mutations and cancer therapeutic response in bladder cancer: Patients carrying ERCC2 mutations were found to be more sensitive to cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy that induces DNA damage, which is mended through NER as well as other repair pathways. Together, these findings suggested that DNA repair, specifically NER, might play an important role in bladder cancer. To dig more deeply into this area, Getz s team, led by first authors Jaegil Kim (Broad Institute), Ken Mouw (Dana-Farber), and Paz Polak (MGH) in collaboration with Dana-Farber s Alan D Andrea, began analyzing the mutational signatures   the characteristic patterns of DNA mutations   in a TCGA cohort of urothelial tumors. They identified four key signatures, including one that seems nearly identical to a previously uncovered signature that is shared across many tumor types, including bladder cancer. Despite its near ubiquity, the biological roots of this signature, known as Signature 5, are not known. To probe it further, the researchers searched for mutated genes that are associated with increased Signature 5 activity in bladder cancer. Sure enough, their top find was ERCC2. This was true not only in the TCGA cohort, but also in two other independent collections of urothelial tumor samples.  That was a big finding, because it suggests that the cause of the Signature 5 mutations might be related to DNA repair , says Getz.  We hypothesize that these mutations are generated across all cancers in the setting of increased levels of DNA damage from tobacco or other mutagens, but in most cancers, the DNA repair machinery works well and repairs most of them   so they are relatively infrequent.  adds Jaegil Kim, co-first author of the paper. Yet in bladder tumors that harbor ERCC2 mutations, the repair machinery is crippled, so Signature 5 DNA mutations persist and accrue over time. Although ERCC2 was by far the strongest genetic association with Signature 5, Getz and his colleagues noticed that several tumors lacked the ERCC2 mutation yet nevertheless showed increased Signature 5 activity. Interestingly, a handful of these tumors carry mutations in a different NER pathway gene. Although the number is small (and not statistically significant), the discovery further underscores the role of this form of DNA repair in bladder cancer. These results also add to scientists  growing but far-from-complete knowledge of the mutational signatures linked with faulty DNA repair. So far, just two other modes of DNA repair (homologous recombination and mismatch-repair) have been assigned mutational signatures. A smoking gun For years, it has been known that smoking can raise a person s risk of developing bladder cancer. Despite this clinical knowledge, there has been little additional proof to corroborate smoking s biological impact in the disease. Indeed, Getz and his colleagues did not see any of the typical  smoking  signatures in bladder tumor genomes. (These include Signature 4 as well as a related signature connected to chewing tobacco.) However, they did uncover a significant association with Signature 5 activity. Regardless of whether or not their tumors harbored ERCC2 mutations, patients who smoked showed a significantly higher prevalence of Signature 5 mutations than patients who did not.  Prior to this work, there was no direct genomic evidence of how smoking contributes to mutations in bladder cancer, due to a lack of the typical smoking signatures,  says Kim.  Our study provides a genomic fingerprint to suggest its role biologically.  In addition to reflecting the genomic impact of cigarette smoke in bladder cancer, Getz s studies of Signature 5 provide other important clinical inroads.  Having a defect in a DNA repair mechanism could represent a vulnerability that can be targeted therapeutically,  says Getz. Uncovering these vulnerabilities   not just in bladder cancer but also in other major tumor types   represents one of the holy grails of mutational signature studies.  As an international community, we are in the process of mapping these signatures across all cancers, explaining their biological meaning and hopefully uncovering new vulnerabilities that can be leveraged for more effective cancer treatments,  says Getz.","Published: May 6, 2016"

New research from scientists at The Rockefeller University shows, for the first time, molecular and cellular processes in human development that occur up to day 14 after fertilization. Published in Nature on May 4, the breakthrough system is the first in which the process of implantation has successfully been replicated in an experimental setting, outside of the uterus. This novel technique vastly expands the ability to answer basic questions about our own development, as well as to understand early pregnancy loss. Implantation is a crucial step in human development. Occurring shortly after fertilization, implantation is the process by which the small, hollow ball of cells called a blastocyst attaches to the uterus, allowing an embryo to begin to take shape.  This portion of human development was a complete black box,  says Ali Brivanlou, Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor and head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Molecular Embryology. To shed light inside that box, the researchers overcame several key problems: they surrounded the blastocyst with just the right chemical environment, and provided a suitable scaffolding for it to attach to. Previous research from co-author Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz and colleagues at the University of Cambridge established a similar method using mouse blastocysts, after multiple attempts to define the right combination of factors. This prompted Brivanlou and colleagues, including research associates Alessia Deglincerti and Gist Croft, research specialist Lauren Pietila, and fellow Rockefeller scientist Eric Siggia, Viola Ward Brinning and Elbert Calhoun Brinning Professor and head of the Laboratory of Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics, to adapt the technique and create an attachment culture for human embryos.  Through this international and multidisciplinary collaboration combining mouse embryology, human embryology, and physics, we were able to create a system that properly recapitulates what happens during human implantation,  says Deglincerti. One known difference between mouse and human development is the shape the blastocyst is in as implantation occurs it is oblong in mice but shaped like a disk in humans.  We actually reproduced the disk,  says Deglincerti. Human variations Once the system was in place, the researchers determined that the embryos displayed the landmarks characteristic of normal development, including the timing of key events that occur in early embryonic development up to 12 days after fertilization. Viewing this stage of development in such detail for the first time also uncovered some surprises. For one thing, there were unexpected differences between the team s observations in humans and previous findings from the mouse experiments.  With this work, we can really appreciate the differences between human and mouse, and across all mammals,  says Brivanlou.  Because of the variations between species, what we learn in model systems is not necessarily relevant to our own development, and these results provide crucial information we couldn t learn elsewhere.  Early cellular distinction: Different cells types are shown above in an early human embryo, 6 days after fertilization. Cell boundaries are indicated in white, cells of the inner cell mass (which will give rise to the embryo proper) are in green, and trophoblast cells (which will give rise to extraembryonic tissues) are in purple and magenta.  Early cellular distinction: Different cell types are shown above in an early human embryo, six days after fertilization. Cell boundaries are indicated in white, cells of the inner cell mass (which will give rise to the embryo proper) are in green, and trophoblast cells (which will give rise to extraembryonic tissues) are in purple and magenta. Also unexpected was a phenomenon they observed known as self-organization. In simple terms, self-organization is when parts of a system become ordered without any outside influence, and it is seen across both living and nonliving systems. One example is the formation of a snowflake, where independent water molecules get together in symmetrical shapes and forms with no external force. On a larger scale, self-organization is a factor in the formation of galaxies and cosmos.  We had seen self-organization using this system in the mouse embryo, and also in human embryonic stem cells, but we did not anticipate we d see self-organization in the context of a whole human embryo,  says Brivanlou.  Amazingly, at least up to the first 12 days, development occurred normally in our system in the complete absence of maternal input.  The scientists originally hypothesized that implantation induced molecular cross talk necessary for development. They continue to believe this dialogue happens, but their findings indicate that this is not required up to day 12. Implications for infertility and beyond In addition to insights into the molecular details of this process, the findings from Brivanlou and colleagues have several clinical implications. In the near future, the ability to study implantation in culture is likely to shed light on why some early miscarriages occur and why in vitro fertilization has a high failure rate. Over the longer term, the work could advance the treatment of a variety of diseases with human embryonic stem cells.  In order for that approach to be effective, we have to understand where these cells are coming from, and what decisions they ve made and are about to make at the molecular level,  Croft says.  Only with that knowledge, specifically from human cells, can we control their ability to become cell types that are useful for drug screening or transplantation.  Perhaps most importantly, this new method opens the door to a wide variety of studies, never before possible, on the molecular events that occur during the very earliest stages of human development.","Published: May 6, 2016"

Unfortunately, most children are not diagnosed until about age 4, when communication and social disabilities become apparent. This neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by social interaction and communication challenges, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. In a recent edition of Scientific Reports, UT Southwestern researchers reported on the identification of a blood biomarker that could distinguish the majority of ASD study participants versus a control group of similar age range. In addition, the biomarker was significantly correlated with the level of communication impairment, suggesting that the blood test may give insight into ASD severity.  Numerous investigators have long sought a biomarker for ASD,  said Dr. Dwight German, study senior author and Professor of Psychiatry at UT Southwestern.  The blood biomarker reported here along with others we are testing can represent a useful test with over 80 percent accuracy in identifying ASD.  Since other studies have found abnormalities in the immune systems of autistic children, researchers set out to search for antibodies in the blood related to ASD. In this study, researchers found that boys with ASD had significantly reduced levels of a serum IgG1 antibody. Investigating further, researchers analyzed 25 peptoid compounds that bound to IgG1 and zeroed in on one   ASD1   that was 66 percent accurate in diagnosing ASD. When combined with thyroid stimulating hormone level measurements, the ASD1-binding biomarker was 73 percent accurate at diagnosis. More testing, including analysis of blood samples from girls with ASD, is needed to further validate the findings, Dr. German said. Girls made up a small ratio of the study group, and the biomarker did not correlate as strongly with ASD diagnosis as with boys.","Published: May 6, 2016"

Precise dosing in intensive care units is critical, as up to two-thirds of patients in the ICU experience serious kidney injury. Medications contribute to this injury in more than 20 percent of cases, largely because many intensive care drugs are potentially dangerous to the kidneys. Determining a safe dosage, however, can be surprisingly difficult. Today, doctors and drug developers rely mainly on animal testing to measure the toxicity of drugs and determine safe doses. But animals process medications more quickly than humans, making it difficult to interpret test results and sometimes leading researchers to underestimate toxicity. The new technique offers a more accurate way to test medications, closely replicating the environment inside a human kidney. It uses a microfluidic chip device to deliver a precise flow of medication across cultured kidney cells. This is believed to be the first time such a device has been used to study how a medication behaves in the body over time, called its ""pharmacokinetic profile."" ""When you administer a drug, its concentration goes up quickly and it's gradually filtered out as it flows through the kidneys,"" said Shuichi Takayama, U-M professor of biomedical engineering. ""A kidney on a chip enables us to simulate that filtering process, providing a much more accurate way to study how medications behave in the body."" Takayama said the use of an artificial device provides the opportunity to run test after test in a controlled environment. It also enables researchers to alter the flow through the device to simulate varying levels of kidney function. ""Even the same dose of the same drug can have very different effects on the kidneys and other organs, depending on how it's administered,"" said former U-M researcher Sejoong Kim, an associate professor at Korea's Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. ""This device provides a uniform, inexpensive way to capture data that more accurately reflects actual human patients."" In the study, the team tested their approach by comparing two different dosing regimens for gentamicin, an antibiotic that's commonly used in intensive care units. They used a microfluidic device that sandwiches a thin, permeable polyester membrane and a layer of cultured kidney cells between top and bottom compartments. They then pumped a gentamicin solution into the top compartment, where it gradually filtered through the cells and the membrane, simulating the flow of medication through a human kidney. One test started with a high concentration that quickly tapered off, mimicking a once-daily drug dose. The other test simulated a slow infusion of the drug, using a lower concentration that stayed constant. Takayama's team then measured damage to the kidney cells inside the device. They found that a once-daily dose of the medication is significantly less harmful than a continuous infusion even though both cases ultimately delivered the same dose of medication. The results of the test could help doctors better optimize dosing regimens for gentamicin in the future. Perhaps most importantly, they showed that a kidney on a chip device can be used to study the flow of medication through human organs. ""We were able to get results that better relate to human physiology, at least in terms of dosing effects, than what's currently possible to obtain from common animal tests,"" Takayama said. ""The goal for the future is to improve these devices to the point where we're able to see exactly how a medication affects the body from moment to moment, in real time."" Takayama said the techniques used in the study should be generalizable to a wide variety of other organs and medications, enabling researchers to gather detailed information on how medications affect the heart, liver and other organs. In addition to helping researchers fine-tune drug dosing regimens, he believes the technique could also help drug makers test drugs more efficiently, bringing new medications to market faster. Within a few years, Takayama envisions the creation of integrated devices that can quickly test multiple medication regimens and deliver a wide variety of information on how they affect human organs. PHASIQ, an Ann Arbor-based spinoff company founded by Takayama in conjunction with the U-M Office of Technology Transfer, is commercializing the biomarker readout aspect of this type of technology.","Published: May 6, 2016"

But no such test has existed for a progressive neurodegenerative disease, called Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), that typically is not diagnosed until at least age 2, after neurological symptoms have begun to develop. Now, a study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis describes a newborn screening test that identifies infants with NPC, an often fatal condition in which cholesterol builds up and eventually destroys brain cells. While there is no cure, early detection and treatment with disease-modifying therapies eventually may save lives and improve prospects for managing the disease in the future. According to the study, the screening test meets all federal requirements for clinical laboratory testing. The investigators verified the accuracy of the screen by testing it on more than 5,000 dried blood spot specimens. Of these, 44 were known to be samples from NPC patients; 134 were samples from people who were known carriers; and the remaining 4,992 were control samples from people without the condition. Using a two-tiered testing strategy, the new test quickly identified all of the NPC patients with no false positives and no false negatives. The progressive loss of brain cells in NPC causes severe developmental disabilities. Life expectancy varies, with affected individuals typically succumbing to the disease by the second decade of life. Treatment with miglustat, an inhibitor of lipid synthesis that is approved outside the U.S. for treatment of NPC, has shown evidence of slowing disease progression. Senior author Daniel S. Ory, MD, and his colleagues currently are evaluating in clinical trials a compound called cyclodextrin that has proved an effective treatment in animal models of NPC. When administered directly into the space surrounding the spinal column, cyclodextrin causes a release of the cholesterol trapped inside the brain cells of NPC mice and cats, reducing neuronal damage and prolonging survival in the animals up to eightfold.  We wanted to develop a newborn screen for NPC because we know that the earlier we intervene with investigational treatments in animal models of the disease, the longer the animals live,  said Ory, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor of Medicine.  If we can identify infants with NPC early, we could direct these children to clinical trials, potentially beginning treatment before they have begun to show symptoms of neurological damage, hopefully slowing disease progression and improving quality of life.  With collaborators at the New York State Department of Health, Ory and colleagues have begun to transition the newborn screening test from the laboratory to the state screening facility. The plan is over the next few years to perform a trial run to assess the ability of the test to prospectively identify newborns with NPC. The pilot program will include specimens from babies whose parents have given permission for the blood samples to be used for research. The investigators said the infants participating in the pilot program won t undergo any additional blood sampling since the new screening test is designed to utilize the standard dried blood spot samples already collected from all babies born in the United States. With miglustat therapy available off-label in the U.S. and potential therapies in clinical trials, the researchers said their goal is to see the test added to the recommended uniform screening panel defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Newborn screening programs vary by state, but most include the disorders recommended by the HHS, and many states test for additional diseases.  One of the considerations for adding a new test to the recommended screening panel is whether we can do anything for patients once they are identified,  Ory said.  Many of these drugs, including cyclodextrin, are still in the experimental stages. But in the context of clinical trials, we do have therapies to offer NPC patients.  The new test measures levels of a bile acid produced by the liver. The researchers suspected bile acids might make good markers for early detection of NPC because these compounds are waste products of cholesterol processing, which is abnormal in these patients. The researchers showed that NPC patients have about thirtyfold higher amounts of this bile acid in the blood than healthy individuals. Importantly, levels of this bile acid also could distinguish between patients with NPC and carriers of the disease who show no symptoms. In the two-tiered testing strategy, the first-tier screening run returns results in about two minutes, according to the researchers. Ory said the first run must be short to make screening feasible for hundreds of samples per day. If any results are ambiguous in the quick test, the second tier test gives results in about seven minutes. Ory said of the more than 5,000 samples they tested, only one required the longer test to clarify an uncertain result. Despite the complexity of the science behind the test, Ory speculated it would be no more expensive to run this new test than other standard newborn screening tests.  These types of tests can be quite automated,  he said.  If you re running 500 samples per day, you can test many specimens at once at robotic handling stations that many state lab facilities already have. The cost of materials and labor would be on par with current accepted newborn screening tests. Once established, a reasonable estimate of the cost of running these tests would be less than $1 per sample.  While cases of NPC are rare, Ory pointed out that the benefits of studying rare diseases can extend beyond patients with the condition.  In studying what causes NPC and how it progresses, we learn more about normal cholesterol metabolism,  Ory said.  Cyclodextrin is being developed as a drug for NPC, but it currently is being tested in the laboratory in other much more common conditions, including atherosclerosis and Alzheimer s disease. The drug has shown positive results in recent studies of mouse models of these diseases. Those researchers would not be studying cyclodextrin if not for the initial work that was done by the NPC community. ","Published: May 6, 2016"

The study, published Monday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, examines the role of human milk hormones in the development of infants  microbiome, a bacterial ecosystem in the digestive system that contributes to multiple facets of health.  This is the first study of its kind to suggest that hormones in human milk may play an important role in shaping a healthy infant microbiome,  said Bridget Young, co-first author and assistant professor of pediatric nutrition at CU Anschutz.  We ve known for a long time that breast milk contributes to infant intestinal maturation and healthy growth. This study suggests that hormones in milk may be partly responsible for this positive impact through interactions with the infant s developing microbiome.  Researchers found that levels of insulin and leptin in the breast milk were positively associated with greater microbial diversity and families of bacteria in the infants  stool. Insulin and leptin were associated with bacterial functions that help the intestine develop as a barrier against harmful toxins, which help prevent intestinal inflammation. By promoting a stronger intestinal barrier early in life, these hormones also may protect children from chronic low-grade inflammation, which can lead to a host of additional digestive problems and diseases. In addition, researchers found significant differences in the intestinal microbiome of breastfed infants who are born to mothers with obesity compared to those born to mothers of normal weight. Infants born to mothers with obesity showed a significant reduction in gammaproteobacteria, a pioneer species that aids in normal intestinal development and microbiome maturation. Gammaproteobacteria have been shown in mice and newborn infants to cause a healthy amount inflammation in their intestines, protecting them from inflammatory and autoimmune disorders later in life. The 2-week-old infants born to obese mothers in this study had a reduced number of gammaproteobacteria in the infant gut microbiome.  I eagerly anticipate our follow-up studies to know whether these early results will help us understand what factors help make up a healthier immune system in infants born to obese mothers over the first year of life,  said Jed Friedman, corresponding author and professor of pediatrics at CU Anschutz.  What happens if you restore these bacteria in the infant born to an obese mother remains an open question.  To examine the role of breast milk hormones, leptin and insulin, researchers analyzed the bacteria present in stool samples from 30 two-week-old infants who were exclusively breastfed  18 infants born to normal weight mothers and 12 born to obese mothers. The researchers not only analyzed what bacteria were growing, but the metabolism of the bacteria that were active in the infants  intestines.  Just like children learn language and social cues as they grow, their digestive system learns how to regulate itself,  said co-first author Dominick Lemas, now an assistant professor at the University of Florida.  What we ve found is that hormones in breast milk are linked to the development of infants  microbiome, potentially having long-term effects on children s intestinal and autoimmune health.  Young and Lemas hypothesize that human milk hormones affect the microbiome by binding to specific receptors in the infants  intestines. These hormones may stimulate the body to produce proteins, called anti-microbial peptides, which kill off certain types of bad bacteria and may stimulate infant intestinal cells to secrete molecules that allow good bacteria to flourish.","Published: May 6, 2016"

But that health benefit could be costly, due to exposure to potentially harmful compounds in motor vehicle exhaust. In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers analyzed breath samples to find out how much of these compounds are absorbed by the body. They report their findings in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology. Previous reports have suggested that cycling in more rural areas and on off-street paths can reduce exposure to traffic-related toxicants. Absorption of compounds in the body   which can lead to deleterious health effects   is not always directly proportional to exposure, say this study s researchers. It is a complex analysis because pollution levels and the way the human body processes compounds can vary. A few teams have investigated this for bicyclists, and they focused on the analysis of blood, urine and saliva samples from those riding in urban or rural areas. But until now, no one has looked at bicyclists  absorption of pollutants while riding on multiple types of routes. So, Alexander Bigazzi and colleagues took a more in-depth look at the issue by using breath analysis. The researchers studied the breath of three cyclists in Portland, Oregon, who rode on off-street bike paths, local streets with lighter traffic and main streets with heavier traffic. They also measured pollution levels in ambient air. Using a pollution detector mounted on the bicycles, the team found that the on-road exposure levels (above the urban background) of volatile organic compounds, a kind of pollution, were 100 to 200 percent higher when the cyclists took routes through high-traffic or industrial areas as compared to low-traffic or off-street routes. Using breath analysis, the team found that absorbed compounds were 40 to 100 percent higher in these situations. The study confirms that people can reduce their exposure and absorption of these toxicants   and potentially mitigate their health effects   by riding farther away from city traffic.

These are small, centimeter-long organs that filter fluids, get rid of waste materials, and trap pathogens, e.g. bacteria or viruses. Lymph nodes are packed with immune cells, and are known to grow in size, or  swell , when they detect invading pathogens. But now, EPFL scientists have unexpectedly discovered that lymph nodes also produce more immune cells when the host is infected with a more complex invader: an intestinal worm. The discovery is published in Cell Reports, and has significant implications for our understanding of how the immune system responds to infections. The discovery was made by the lab of Nicola Harris at EPFL. Her postdoc and first author Lalit Kumar Dubey noticed that the lymph nodes of mice that had been infected with the intestinal worm Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri had massively grown in size. This worm is an excellent tool for studying how the worm interacts with its host, and is therefore used as a standard throughout labs working in the field. Lymph nodes have microscopic compartments called  follicles , where they store a specific type of immune cells, the B-cells. Stored in the follicles, B-cells pump out antibodies into the bloodstream to attack invading pathogens. The researchers found that the mouse lymph nodes were actually producing more follicles, suggesting they were producing more B-cells in response to the worm infection. Of course, this is not a simple event. Like many biological processes, it involves an entire sequence of molecular signals that result in the formation of new cells and tissue. The EPFL scientists were able to reconstruct the molecular sequence, which is fairly complex: when the mouse is infected with the intestinal worm, a  cytokine  molecule is produced. This cytokine then stimulates B-cells in the lymph nodes to produce a molecule called a lymphotoxin. The lymphotoxin then interacts with the cells that form the foundation of the actual lymph node   the so-called  stromal cells . The stromal cells then produce another cytokine, which stimulates the production of new follicles in the lymph node. Until now, formation of new B-cell follicles in the lymph nodes was thought to only happen just after birth. This study provides the first detailed evidence to show that this phenomenon can take place in an adult mammal. The researchers also showed that formation of new follicles is important for fighting infection, as it encourages the production of more antibodies. Unlike bacterial or viral infections, worm infections are enormously complex.  Worms are large creatures that produce a host of their own molecules upon infection,  says Nicola Harris.  Some of these molecules stimulate the host s immune system while some others suppress it. The field is investigating every one of these molecules, but it is slow work.  It must be noted that the new production of B-cell follicles has only been confirmed in worm infections.  We did not see the same effect with bacterial infections in mice,  says Nicola Harris.  Nonetheless, we are pursuing a deeper understanding of this process to see if it is involved in producing adequate antibodies in response to vaccines.  This work was lead by Nicola Harris s lab at EPFL s Global Health Institute, and included contributions from the Institute of Immunobiology of Kantonsspital St. Gallen and the Center for Immunity and Infection at the University of Lausanne.

In a new study published in PLoS Genetics, USC Stem Cell researcher Lindsey Barske from the laboratory of Gage Crump and her colleagues identify the roles of key molecular signals that control this critical timing. Previous work from the Crump and other labs demonstrated that two types of molecular signals, called Jagged-Notch and Endothelin1 (Edn1), are key for shaping the face. Loss of these signals results in facial deformities in both zebrafish and humans, revealing these as essential for patterning the faces of all vertebrates. Using sophisticated genetic, genomic and imaging tools to study zebrafish, the researchers discovered that Jagged-Notch and Edn1 work in tandem to control where and when stem cells turn into facial cartilage. In the lower face, Edn1 signals accelerate cartilage formation early in development. In the upper face, Jagged-Notch signals prevent stem cells from making cartilage until later in development. The authors found that these differences in the timing of stem cells turning into cartilage play a major role in making the upper and lower regions of the face distinct from one another.  We ve shown that the earliest blueprint of the facial skeleton is set up by spatially intersecting signals that control when stem cells turn into cartilage or bone. Logically, therefore, small shifts in the levels of these signals throughout evolution could account for much of the diversity of shapes we see within the skulls of different animals, as well as the wonderful array of facial shapes seen in humans,  said Barske, lead author and an A.P. Giannini postdoctoral research fellow. Additional co-authors included Amjad Askary, Elizabeth Zuniga, Bartosz Balczerski and Paul Bump from USC as well as James T. Nichols from the University of Oregon.

Medherant s patch, known as the TEPI-patch , is a thin, strong, easy-to-apply and easy-to-remove patch capable of delivering higher doses of drugs directly to the areas where they are needed. The therapy is delivered by the patch over a period of one to twelve hours or more, depending on the patient s requirements and the drug being administered. The technology, which is initially being developed for Ibuprofen and Methyl Salicylate (used in topical pain relief), is capable of working with a wide range of products, including drugs that have failed clinical trials because of their unsuitability for oral consumption.  The patches are easy to manufacture because, unlike other patch technologies, this does not involve the use of any solvents. They can also use less material, so this technology also has the potential to relieve huge cost burdens from healthcare systems. The investment, which totals  250,000 from both Mercia s third-party University Growth Fund and Growth Fund 4, will allow Medherant to exploit the high levels of interest in its technology following significant recent media reporting. The investment will also be used to enable the company to continue product development. Since Mercia s first investment last June 2015, the company has secured an exclusive deal with Bostik SA, a leading adhesive specialist, to use a novel pressure sensitive adhesive material in the development of the patch.  Medherant has also moved to new laboratories, and has validated that its technology works successfully on drugs that were previously not suitable for transdermal delivery. During this time, Medherant has worked closely with Mercia s Head of Technology Transfer, Dr. Nicola Broughton, who commented:  It is wonderful to see Medherant achieve such impressive results, whilst still being at a relatively early stage in its development.   Medherant, which is a spinout from our partner the University of Warwick, is testament to the potential that lies within the Midlands in Life Sciences & Bio-Sciences, and I look forward to the continued relationship with the team.  Nigel Davis, CEO of Medherant Ltd, said:  Medherant has benefitted from a lot of commercial and media interest over the past few months, and we are grateful to Nicola and Mercia for their support as we continue to harness this awareness and build on our existing patch technology.

Bruce Springsteen's ""Born to Run"" on the car radio, for example, may remind you of your first love or your first speeding ticket. But a Dartmouth- and Princeton-led brain scanning study shows that people can intentionally forget past experiences by changing how they think about the context of those memories. The findings have a range of potential applications centered on enhancing desired memories, such as developing new educational tools, or diminishing harmful memories, including treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study appears in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. See Also: Manipulating memory with light, researchers erase specific memories in mice Since Ancient Greece, memory theorists have known that we use context the situation we're in, including sights, sounds, smells, where we are, who we are with to organize and retrieve our memories. But the Dartmouth- and Princeton-led team wanted to know whether and how people can intentionally forget past experiences. They designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to specifically track thoughts related to memories' contexts, and put a new twist on a centuries-old psychological research technique of having subjects memorize and recall a list of unrelated words. In the new study, researchers showed participants images of outdoor scenes, such as forests, mountains and beaches, as they studied two lists of random words, manipulating whether they were told to forget or remember the first list prior to studying the second list. ""Our hope was the scene images would bias the background, or contextual, thoughts that people had as they studied the words to include scene-related thoughts,"" says lead author Jeremy Manning, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth. ""We used fMRI to track how much people were thinking of scene-related things at each moment during our experiment. That allowed us to track, on a moment-by-moment basis, how those scene or context representations faded in and out of people's thoughts over time."" The study's participants were told to either forget or remember the random words presented to them interspersed between scene images. Right after they were told to forget, the fMRI showed that they ""flushed out"" the scene-related activity from their brains. ""It's like intentionally pushing thoughts of your grandmother's cooking out of your mind if you don't want to think about your grandmother at that moment,"" Manning says. ""We were able to physically measure and quantify that process using brain data."" But when the researchers told participants to remember the studied list rather than forget it, this flushing out of scene-related thoughts didn't occur. Further, the amount that people flushed out scene-related thoughts predicted how many of the studied words they would later remember, which shows the process is effective at facilitating forgetting. See Also: Memory replay prioritizes high-reward memories The study has two important implications. ""First, memory studies are often concerned with how we remember rather than how we forget, and forgetting is typically viewed as a 'failure' in some sense, but sometimes forgetting can be beneficial, too,"" Manning says. ""For example, we might want to forget a traumatic event, such as soldiers with PTSD. Or we might want to get old information 'out of our head,' so we can focus on learning new material. Our study identified one mechanism that supports these processes."" The second implication is more subtle but also important. ""It's very difficult to specifically identify the neural representations of contextual information,"" Manning says. ""If you consider the context you experience something in, we're really referring to the enormously complex, seemingly random thoughts you had during that experience. Those thoughts are presumably idiosyncratic to you as an individual, and they're also potentially unique to that specific moment. So, tracking the neural representations of these things is extremely challenging because we only ever have one measurement of a particular context. Therefore, you can't directly train a computer to recognize what context 'looks like' in the brain because context is a continually moving and evolving target. In our study, we sidestepped this issue using a novel experimental manipulation we biased people to incorporate those scene images into the thoughts they had when they studied new words. Since those scenes were common across people and over time, we were able to use fMRI to track the associated mental representations from moment to moment."" Dartmouth CollegeManning JR et al.

The substances form during food processing, in particular, when refining vegetable oils at high temperatures (approx. 200 C). The highest levels of GE, as well as 3-MCPD and 2-MCPD (including esters) were found in palm oils and palm fats, followed by other oils and fats. For consumers aged three and above, margarines and  pastries and cakes  were the main sources of exposure to all substances. Glycidyl fatty acid esters   genotoxic and carcinogenic EFSA s expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) considered information on the toxicity of glycidol (the parent compound of GE) for its risk assessment of GE, assuming a complete conversion of the esters into glycidol following ingestion. Dr Helle Knutsen, Chair of the CONTAM Panel, said:  There is sufficient evidence that glycidol is genotoxic and carcinogenic, therefore the CONTAM Panel did not set a safe level for GE.  When assessing genotoxic and carcinogenic substances that are unintentionally present in the food chain, EFSA calculates a  margin of exposure  for consumers. In general, the higher the margin of exposure is, the lower the level of concern for consumers. The Panel concluded that GE is a potential health concern for all younger age groups with average exposures, and for consumers with high exposure in all age groups.  The exposure to GE of babies consuming solely infant formula is a particular concern as this is up to ten times what would be considered of low concern for public health,  said Dr Knutsen. The Panel s review revealed that levels of GE in palm oils and fats halved between 2010 and 2015, due to voluntary measures taken by producers. This has contributed to an important fall in consumer exposure to these substances. Exposure to 3-MCPD over safe level; insufficient data on 2-MCPD  We have set a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.8 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day ( g/kg bw/day) for 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters based on evidence linking this substance to organ damage in animal tests,  explained Dr Knutsen. She added that,  the toxicological information is too limited, however, to set a safe level for 2-MCPD.  Estimated average and high exposures to 3-MCPD from both forms for young age groups including adolescents (up to 18 years of age) exceed the TDI and are a potential concern for health. Palm oil is a major contributor to 3-MCPD and 2-MCPD exposure for most individuals. Levels of 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters in vegetable oils were largely unchanged over the last five years. What happens next? This risk assessment will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate EU food safety. They will use EFSA s scientific advice to consider how to manage the potential risks for consumers from exposure to these substances in food. The Panel has also made several recommendations for further research to fill data gaps and improve the knowledge on the toxicity of these substances, particularly 2-MCPD, and on consumer exposure to them through food.","Published: May 5, 2016"

With resistance growing to existing antibiotics, there is a vital and urgent need for the discovery and development of new antibiotics that are cost effective.  Promising developments are derivatives of the antibiotic pleuromutilin, which are isolated from the mushroom Clitopilus passeckerianus. These new compounds are some of the only new class of antibiotics to join the market recently as human therapeutics.  Furthermore, with their novel mode of action and lack of cross-resistance, pleuromutilins and their derivatives represent a class with further great potential, particularly for treating resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XTB). However, mushrooms are basidiomycete fungi which are not generally amenable to strain improvement and fermentation. Therefore, in collaboration with pharmaceutical company GSK, Bristol scientists carried out research to identify the genes involved in the production of pleuromutilin.  They discovered that a seven-gene cluster is required to produce the antibiotic in C. passeckerianus.  The seven-gene pleuromutilin cluster was then reconstructed within a more industrial fungus, Aspergillus oryzae which belongs to a different group of fungi, the ascomycetes.  This resulted in a significant increase (2,106 per cent) in production. This is the first gene cluster from a basidiomycete to be successfully expressed in an ascomycete, and paves the way for the exploitation of a metabolically rich but traditionally overlooked group of fungi. Co-author of the research, Professor Gary Foster said:  This was a massive team effort over many years to achieve this major breakthrough.  It involved, in the School of Biological Sciences, the drug discovery team led by myself and Dr Andy Bailey, with Dr Colin Lazarus on alternative expression platforms.

With this development, we are now ideally placed to develop novel derivatives and new antibiotics and produce them rapidly and cost effectively   something which is desperately needed globally.

This metabolite singularly reversed depression-like behaviors in mice without triggering any of the anesthetic, dissociative, or addictive side effects associated with ketamine.  This discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of how this rapid antidepressant mechanism works and holds promise for development of more robust and safer treatments,  said Carlos Zarate, M.D. of the NIH s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a study co-author and a pioneer of research using ketamine to treat depression.  By using a team approach, researchers were able to reverse-engineer ketamine s workings from the clinic to the lab to pinpoint what makes it so unique.  NIMH grantee Todd Gould, M.D. (link is external), of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in collaboration with Zarate and other colleagues, report on their findings May 4, 2016 in the journal Nature. The team also included researchers at the NIH s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the University of North Carolina.  Now that we know that ketamine s antidepressant actions in mice are due to a metabolite, not ketamine itself, the next steps are to confirm that it works similarly in humans, and determine if it can lead to improved therapeutics for patients,  explained Gould. Clinical trials by Zarate and others have shown that ketamine can lift depression in hours, or even minutes   much faster than the most commonly used antidepressant medications now available, which often require weeks to take effect. Further, the antidepressant effects of a single dose can last for a week or longer. However, despite legitimate medical uses, ketamine also has dissociative, euphoric, and addictive properties, making it a potential drug of abuse and limiting its usefulness as a depression medication. In hopes of finding leads to a more practical treatment, the research team sought to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which ketamine relieves depression. Ketamine belongs to a class of drugs that block cellular receptors for glutamate, the brain s chief excitatory chemical messenger. Until now, the prevailing view was that ketamine produced its antidepressant effects by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptors. However, human trials of other NMDA-receptor blockers failed to produce ketamine s robust and sustained antidepressant effects. So the team explored the effects of ketamine on antidepressant-responsive behaviors in mice. Ketamine harbors two chemical forms that are mirror images of each other, denoted (S)- and (R)-ketamine. The investigators found that while (S)-ketamine is more potent at blocking NMDA receptors, it is less effective in reducing depression-like behaviors than the (R) form.A team of NIH intramural scientists and grantees traced ketamine s rapid antidepressant effects to activation of AMPA receptors by a byproduct of its chemical breakdown called (2R,6R)-HNK (above)   a different mechanism than had been previously assumed.NCATS The team then looked at the effects of the metabolites created as the body breaks down (S)- and (R)-ketamine. It was known that ketamine s antidepressant effects are greater in female mice. NIA researchers Irving Wainer, Ph.D., and Ruin Moaddel, Ph.D. identified a key metabolite (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK (hydroxynorketamine) and showed that it is pharmacologically active. The team then discovered that levels of this metabolite were three times higher in female mice, hinting that it might be responsible for the sex difference in the antidepressant-like effect. To find out, the researchers chemically blocked the metabolism of ketamine. This prevented formation of the metabolite, which blocked the drug s antidepressant-like effects. Like ketamine, this metabolite includes two forms that mirror each other. By testing both forms, they found that one   (2R,6R)-HNK   had antidepressant-like effects similar to ketamine, lasting for at least three days in mice. Notably, unlike ketamine, the compound does not inhibit NMDA receptors. It instead activates, possibly indirectly, another type of glutamate receptor,  -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA). Blocking AMPA receptors prevented the antidepressant-like effects of (2R,6R)-HNK in mice. The experiments confirmed that the rapid antidepressant-like effects require activation of AMPA receptors, not inhibition of NMDA receptors. Ketamine also has effects in mice that mimic its dissociative, euphoric effects in humans and underlie its abuse and addictive potential; however, these effects were not observed with (2R,6R)-HNK. (2R,6R)-HNK did not cause the changes in physical activity, sensory processing, and coordination in mice that occur with ketamine. In an experimental situation where mice were able to self-administer medication, they did so with ketamine but not the (2R,6R)-HNK metabolite, indicating that (2R, 6R)-HNK is not addictive.  Working in collaboration with NIH and academic researchers, NCATS chemists played a critical role in isolating the specific metabolite of ketamine responsible for fighting depression,  said Christopher P. Austin, M.D., NCATS director.  Overall, our collective efforts exemplify how a collaborative, team science approach can help advance the translational process in ways that help get more treatments to more patients more quickly.   Unraveling the mechanism mediating ketamine s antidepressant activity is an important step in the process of drug development,  said Richard J. Hodes, M.D., NIA director.  New approaches are critical for the treatment of depression, especially for older adults and for patients who do not respond to current medications.   Pending confirmation in humans, this line of studies exemplifies the power of mouse translational experiments for teasing out brain mechanisms that hold promise for future treatment breakthroughs,  added NIMH acting director Bruce Cuthbert, Ph.D.,.  The researchers are now following up on their discovery with safety and toxicity studies of the metabolite as part of a drug development plan in advance of a NIMH clinical trial in humans for the treatment of depression.","Published: May 5, 2016"

Ten minutes ago you made the turn. Still no restaurant in sight. How far will you be willing to drive in the same direction?

Is it possible the directions are incorrect? See Also: The role of dopaminergic neurons in decision making Human brains are constantly processing data to make statistical assessments that translate into the feeling we call confidence, according to a study published in Neuron. This feeling of confidence is central to decision making, and, despite ample evidence of human fallibility, the subjective feeling relies on objective calculations. ""The feeling ultimately relies on the same statistical computations a computer would make,"" says Professor Adam Kepecs, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and lead author of the new study. ""People often focus on the situations where confidence is divorced from reality,"" he says. ""But if confidence were always error-prone, what would be its function? If we didn't have the ability to optimally assess confidence, we'd routinely find ourselves driving around for hours in this scenario."" Calculating confidence for a statistician involves looking at a set of data perhaps a sampling of marbles pulled from a bag and making a conclusion about the entire bag based on that sample. ""The feeling of confidence and the objective calculation are related intuitively,"" says Kepecs. ""But how much so?"" In experiments with human subjects, Kepecs and colleagues therefore tried to control for different factors that can vary from person to person. The aim was to establish what evidence contributed to each decision. In this way they could compare people's reports of confidence with the optimal statistical answer. ""If we can quantify the evidence that informs a person's decision, then we can ask how well a statistical algorithm performs on the same evidence,"" says Kepecs. He and graduate student Joshua Sanders created video games to compare human and computer performance. They had human volunteers listen to streams of clicking sounds and determine which clicks were faster. Participants rated confidence in each choice on a scale of one (a random guess) to five (high confidence). What Kepecs and his colleagues found was that human responses were similar to statistical calculations. The brain produces feelings of confidence that inform decisions the same way statistics pulls patterns out of noisy data. Kepecs's model for human confidence stood up to a follow-on experiment in which participants answered questions comparing the populations of various countries. Unlike the perceptual test, this one had the added complexity of each participant's individual knowledge base. Learn More: Modelling how the brain makes complex decisions The development of a model for confidence is a first step toward Kepecs' ultimate goal to find out where this inner statistician sits in the brain and how it does its data processing. It is Kepecs' thesis that statistics - generated by the objective processing of sensory and other data - is the ultimate language of the brain.

Peter Kuhn, PhD, of the University of Southern California (USC), will lead the project team for  High Definition Single Cell Analysis of Blood and Tissue Biopsies in Patients with Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Hepatic Metastasectomy  (HD-SCA). The team is comprised of experts from the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, USC, Scripps Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic and four sponsoring pharmaceutical companies. Tumor characterization by biopsy has the potential to be used to make decisions at every stage of cancer therapy. Traditional solid tumor biopsy use is limited because the procedure is often invasive, cannot be done sequentially and does not always provide enough material for analysis. The HD-SCA project addresses the challenges of traditional solid tumor biopsy by measuring the characteristics of tumor cells from an easily accessible source: tumor cells found in the blood (liquid biopsy). The primary goal of this Biomarkers Consortium project is to determine how well biological marker (biomarker) measurements compare between solid tumor and liquid biopsies from patients with colorectal cancer. If liquid biopsy proves to perform as well as solid-tissue biopsy analysis, it could allow detailed, rapid and non-invasive tumor testing. This type of tumor analysis is essential for the broad application of personalized medicine in cancer.","Published: May 4, 2016"

In fact, the increase in levels of obesity in dogs mirrors that in humans, implicating factors such as reduced exercise and ready access to high calorie food factors. However, despite the fact that dog owners control their pets  diet and exercise, some breeds of dog are more susceptible to obesity than others, suggesting the influence of genetic factors. Labradors are the most common breed of dog in the UK, USA and many other countries worldwide and the breed is known as being particularly obesity-prone. In a study published today in the journal Cell Metabolism, an international team led by researchers at the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, report a study of 310 pet and assistance dog Labradors. Independent veterinary professionals weighed the dogs and assessed their body condition score, and the scientists searched for variants of three candidate obesity-related genes. The team also assessed  food motivation  using a questionnaire in which owners reported their dog s behavior related to food. The researchers found that a variant of one gene in particular, known as POMC, was strongly associated with weight, obesity and appetite in Labradors and flat coat retrievers. Around one in four (23%) Labradors is thought to carry at least one copy of the variant. In both breeds, for each copy of the gene carried, the dog was on average 1.9kg heavier, an effect size particularly notable given the extent to which owners, rather than the dogs themselves, control the amount of food and exercise their dogs receive.  This is a common genetic variant in Labradors and has a  significant effect on those dogs that carry it, so it is likely that this helps explain why Labradors are more prone to being overweight in comparison to other breeds,  explains first author Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge.  However, it s not a straightforward picture as the variant is even more common among flat coat retrievers, a breed not previously flagged as being prone to obesity.  The gene affected is known to be important in regulating how the brain recognises hunger and the feeling of being full after a meal.  People who live with Labradors often say they are obsessed by food, and that would fit with what we know about this genetic change,  says Dr Raffan. Senior co-author Dr Giles Yeo adds:  Labradors make particularly successful working and pet dogs because they are loyal, intelligent and eager to please, but importantly, they are also relatively easy to train. Food is often used as a reward during training, and carrying this variant may make dogs more motivated to work for a titbit.  But it s a double-edged sword   carrying the variant may make them more trainable, but it also makes them susceptible to obesity. This is something owners will need to be aware of so they can actively manage their dog s weight.  The researchers believe that a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the POMC gene, which is also found in humans, might have implications for the health of both Labradors and human. Professor Stephen O Rahilly, Co-Director of the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, says:  Common genetic variants affecting the POMC gene are associated with human body weight and there are even some rare obese people who lack a very similar part of the POMC gene to the one that is missing in the dogs. So further research in these obese Labradors may not only help the wellbeing of companion animals but also have important lessons for human health.

It is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in UK women, with around 9,000 new cases being diagnosed each year. Researchers at the University of Cambridge, Oxford University and QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane studied the DNA of over 7,000 women with endometrial cancer and 37,000 women without cancer to identify genetic variants that affected a woman s risk of developing the disease. The results are published in the journal Nature Genetics. Dr Deborah Thompson from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge said:  Our findings help us to paint a clearer picture of the genetic causes of endometrial cancer in women, particularly where there no strong family history of cancer. Prior to this study, we only knew of four regions of the genome in which a common genetic variant increases a woman s risk of endometrial cancer.  In this study we have identified another five regions, bringing the total to nine. This finding doubles the number of known risk regions, and therefore makes an important contribution to our knowledge of the genetic drivers of endometrial cancer.  Interestingly, several of the gene regions we identified in the study were already known to contribute to the risk of other common cancers such as ovarian and prostate.  Although each individual variant only increases risk by around 10-15%, their real value will be in looking at the total number of such variants inherited by a woman, together with her other risk factors, in order to identify those women at higher risk of endometrial cancer so that they can be regularly checked and be alert to the early signs and symptoms of the disease.  The study also looked at how the identified gene regions might be increasing the risk of cancer, and these findings have implications for the future treatment of endometrial cancer patients.  As we develop a more comprehensive view of the genetic risk factors for endometrial cancer, we can start to work out which genes could potentially be targeted with new treatments down the track,  said Associate Professor Amanda Spurdle from QIMR Berghofer.  In particular, we can start looking into whether there are drugs that are already approved and available for use that can be used to target those genes.  The study was an international collaboration involving researchers from Australia, the United Kingdom, German, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, the United States and China. The UK part of the study received funding from Cancer Research UK. Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK s science information manager, said:  The discovery of genetic changes that affect women s risk of developing endometrial   or womb   cancer could help doctors identify women at higher risk, who could benefit from being more closely monitored for signs of the disease.  It might also provide clues into the faulty molecules that play an important role in womb cancer, leading to potential new treatments. More than a third of womb cancer cases in the UK each year could be prevented, and staying a healthy weight and keeping active are both great ways for women to reduce the risk.

The authors identified 43 specific genes with autism susceptibility that also have an association with cancer.  This striking coincidence of a remarkably large number of genes implicated in both autism spectrum disorder and cancers has not been previously highlighted in the scientific literature,  said Jacqueline Crawley, MIND Institute distinguished professor and endowed chair.  Potentially common biological mechanisms suggest that it may be possible to repurpose drug treatments for cancer as potential therapeutics for neurodevelopmental disorders.   Autism and Cancer Shared Risk Genes, Pathways and Drug Targets,  is published online in Trends in Genetics, a Cell Symposia publication. Crawley collaborated on the work with professor and chair of the UC Davis Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Wolf-Dietrich Heyer, who is affiliated with the Cancer Center and Janine LaSalle, professor of medical microbiology and immunology, who is associated with the MIND Institute.  Autisms  are best conceptualized like cancers, the authors write: in the plural. Like cancers, the behaviorally defined condition encompasses a broad range of putative causes, symptoms and outcomes. Included in the dozens of genes implicated in both cancer and autism are genes for relatively rare syndromes, such as Rett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, whose sufferers experience an array of physical and neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability, as well as communication deficits characterized as autism. What does tumor cell proliferation have in common with synapse formation and brain development?  Errors associated with genome maintenance during fetal life may occur at critical time periods for [brain development] resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders,  said Heyer,  whereas errors more commonly occur during adult life in cell types susceptible to tumors.   Genes encoding nuclear proteins involved in epigenetic functions were frequently shared between cancer and ASD, implicating the importance of aberrant gene regulation in both disease states,  La Salle said. Considerable translational value can be gained from a new focus on understanding the genetic commonalities of autisms and cancers.  It may be possible to repurpose available cancer drugs with reasonable safety profiles as targeted treatments for ASD,  the authors write.  Stratifying individuals with ASD who harbor a risk gene for autism that is also a risk gene for cancer may enable therapeutic development of personalized medicines based on the specific causal mutation.

The Rice lab of Jeffrey Tabor has released FlowCal, an open-source software package that improves the ability of researchers to quantitatively compare flow-cytometry data. The software is detailed in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Synthetic Biology.  This is a much-needed software tool to help standardize data in synthetic biology,  Tabor said.  Specifically, it will allow biologists in different laboratories and across different publications to compare their measurements to one another. It should help advance synthetic biology from an ad hoc to a mature engineering discipline.  Labs use cytometry to gather information about biological processes within cells as they flow through the instrument.  It can measure fluorescent signals from tens of thousands of cells in a couple of minutes,  said Sebasti n Castillo-Hair, who led the project with John Sexton. Both are graduate students in the Tabor lab.  This is useful because fluorescent signals represent a lot of things in cells. In synthetic biology, for example, fluorescence represents the output of a genetic circuit.  The lab programs genetic circuits in cells   the biological equivalent of electronic circuits   to sense, compute and respond to their environments. Fluorescent reporter proteins are placed into the circuitry because they are easy to detect and allow researchers to measure and debug the circuit s performance.  We can get a lot of information from flow cytometry,  Castillo-Hair said.  We can not only get the average fluorescence of many cells; we actually obtain the fluorescence of each individual cell. This gives us a nice fluorescence distribution across the whole cell population. And there s a ton of biological information that can be extracted from that.  The problem for bioengineers has been that results from different labs   or even from different instruments in the same lab   are impossible to compare quantitatively. Flow cytometers produce data in what researchers call  arbitrary units  that are subject to variables like the instrument brand and its settings and calibration. By using commercially available calibration particles to establish a baseline, these units can be converted to more standardized  molecules of equivalent fluorophore  that allow for comparison. But because no convenient, nonproprietary tool existed to perform the calibration, arbitrary units have been impossible to match up. So the project was born out of frustration.  We both have backgrounds in more traditional engineering disciplines,  Castillo-Hair said.  I m from mechanical engineering; John is from electrical engineering. We re familiar with having numbers that actually mean something.   We re engineers at heart, and we need to characterize the things we build,  Sexton added.  To date, in this field, we ve largely been playing in our own sandboxes, which is very frustrating for somebody who s trying to take things that other people have made and use them in your own research. It was clear to us that we needed to use the same yardstick everywhere.   This software is a big step,  Castillo-Hair said.  It allows you to refer gene expression units to a common number that you can very easily compare to what other people have measured in your lab, even when completely different instrument settings have been used. With a few additional steps, data from different instruments and labs can become comparable as well.  To make it accessible to the largest number of researchers, the program has been designed to work with Microsoft Excel, for which the Rice team has designed templates. Once a simple Excel file is prepared, FlowCal reads and processes data from calibration particles. This information is then used to convert cell fluorescence to calibrated units. Finally, the program generates an Excel file with cell fluorescence statistics and a set of plots of calibration particles and cell samples. Sexton said FlowCal has become a standard tool in the Tabor lab.  This is easy enough to use that even people without any programming knowledge can pick it up really quickly,  he said. The researchers programmed FlowCal in the common Python language and encourage others to add on or modify it to suit their own needs.  We ve made it pretty easy to collaborate, if other people want to add to it,  Sexton said.  We re open to feedback.  Co-authors of the paper are Rice graduate students Brian Landry and Evan Olson, and Oleg Igoshin, a Rice associate professor of bioengineering. Tabor is an assistant professor of bioengineering.

According to the researchers, the statistical method called Monovar detailed in Nature Methods will help them determine the human genome s role in how diseases like cancer evolve. They expect it will advance cancer diagnostics and treatment, personalized medicine and prenatal genetic diagnostics.The project led by Ken Chen, an assistant professor of bioinformatics and computational biology at MD Anderson and an adjunct assistant professor of computer science at Rice, aims to detect slight alterations in DNA known as single nucleotide variants.  Because NGS measures large numbers of cells, genomic variations within tissue samples are often masked,  Chen said. The subsequent development of single-cell sequencing has had an impact on cancer research, neurobiology, microbiology and immunology and has improved the understanding of tumors, he said.  If we can resolve genomic data to a single cell, then we can have much more and better data to understand the biology of cancer genomes,  said Hamim Zafar, a graduate student at Rice and co-lead author with Yong Wang, a senior postdoctoral fellow at MD Anderson. Rice computer scientist Luay Nakhleh, a co-author of the paper, said tumors are known to have a variety of mutations.  This is known as tumor heterogeneity,  he said.  The cells don t all have the same genome in them, in the sense that they don t all have the same mutation. Biologists recognize this, but neither data nor the methods have been available to read and analyze it.  Monovar should fill that gap, he said.  Does heterogeneity play a role in a cancer becoming metastatic or not responding to a drug? This will allow us to ask questions and start looking at heterogeneity from an evolutionary perspective.  Pinpointing real mutations and eliminating errors will be key to designing custom therapies, Nakhleh said.  These methods are being designed to catalog all the mutations in cells and understand the implications. When people talk about personalized medicine and cancer genomics, this is what they want to know.  He said it was helpful that Zafar had steady access to people and data at MD Anderson during the two years it took to develop Monovar, which was also the basis for his doctoral thesis.  This is a great success story about the value of collaboration between Rice and the Texas Medical Center,  Nakhleh said.  Though Hamim is a Rice student, has an office here and an office there, is co-advised by Dr. Chan and works closely with Nicholas Navin, one of the authorities in this field whose lab is developing methods for obtaining single-cell data.

They promote the proliferation of B cells that produce highly selective antibodies against invading pathogens while weeding out those that generate potentially harmful ones. In their latest study, researchers at La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology identified a key signal that drives the commitment of immature Tfh cells into fully functional Tfh cells and thus driving the step-by-step process that results in a precisely tailored and effective immune response. Specifically, the study published in the May issue of Nature Immunology and led by La Jolla Institute Professor Shane Crotty, Ph.D., and Instructor Kok-Fai Kong, Ph.D., reported that an enzyme called TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) controls the maturation of antibodies by associating with a key signaling molecule known as Inducible T cell Co- Stimulator or ICOS. While ICOS was known to be clearly essential for most Tfh cell functions, the underlying mechanism had remained unclear. Understanding the molecular details of how ICOS exercises its critical influence may allow scientists to manipulate antibody specificity to design better vaccines and create novel treatments for autoimmune disorders. Autoimmunity lies at the root of over 80 disease including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.  Tfh cells have recently been recognized as important players in the immune system, and we now know they are essential for almost all antibody responses,  said Crotty.  Tfh cells control the whole process of generating high affinity antibodies, and ICOS is a receptor molecule strongly required for Tfh cells to work. Understand ICOS better, and you can make more Tfh when needed, and block it when not needed.  In fact, TBK1 may also be a contributor to debilitating diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig s disease) and childhood herpes simplex virus encephalitis, if its connection with ICOS somehow triggers B cell activation and specific antibody production against the body s own cells in ALS or an excessive response to the invading viruses in childhood encephalitis. Knowing how ICOS is regulated will help scientists understand how these diseases erupt, as much as it could help further vaccine development. ICOS gets antibody production started by promoting the maturation of Tfh cells, which migrate into compartments or follicles of immune organs such as spleens and lymph nodes, which themselves are full of B cells. The body has billions of B cells, each one and its daughter cells recognize something different, so very few of which can recognize the structure of any given germ. Once in contact with Tfh, some B cells become activated, migrate to an area of the follicle called the germinal center and start dividing rapidly under influence from Tfh. While most B cells have a low affinity for pathogens, which might effectively fend off a relatively mild virus, Tfh (with the stimulation of ICOS) allows the select few that produce highly specific and more strongly reactive antibodies to proliferate and outcompete their less specific brethren. The survivors undergo successive rounds of mutation resulting in better and better antibodies during the course of an immune response.  We were looking to find out a specific signaling pathway that impacted ICOS,  said Kong.  There is a family of such checkpoint molecules like ICOS, but ICOS has a capability that is not shared with other checkpoint molecules. Its ability to drive antibody differentiation is found only in ICOS, and not in other family members. The connection between ICOS and TBK1 provides important clues to this mystery.  Kong and Crotty s team discovered that ICOS recruits the signaling TBK1 enzyme, which activates certain genes in Tfh cells, thus beginning the whole process of high-affinity antibody production. The team led by Dr. Kong identified a region of the ICOS molecule that recruits TBK1, and moreover, disrupting this area prohibits the association between ICOS and TBK1 and severely impairs Tfh and ultimately antibody production. Therefore, this could provide an important target for disease interventions or vaccine designs. The researchers are now looking at how ICOS signals can be altered to diminish autoimmune disorders and augmented for more effective vaccine development, and are beginning research on how ICOS signaling may benefit Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapies, which involves engineering of patient s own immune cells to recognize and attack their cancers.

For this reason, NK cell transfer therapy is a promising cancer treatment. Expansion and persistence of donor NK cells correlates with tumor clearance, suggesting that therapeutic efficacy can be enhanced by augmenting NK cell survival. Now, Whitney Rabacal, Eric Sebzda, Ph.D., and colleagues show in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that a transcription factor called KLF2 is critical for NK cell expansion and survival. They discovered that KLF2 both limits immature NK cell proliferation and instructs mature NK cells to home to niches rich in interleukin 15 (IL-15), which is necessary for their continued survival. Importantly, this report suggests that tumors avoid immune clearance by promoting KLF2 destruction within the NK cell population, thereby starving these cells of IL-15. Therefore, recruiting IL-15 transpresenting cells to tumor microenvironments may improve NK cell-mediated cancer therapy by preventing NK cell exhaustion and restoring antitumor immunity.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), the University of California Santa Barbara, and Washington University in St. Louis have shown for the first time how neurons in the SCN are connected to each other, shedding light on this vital area of the brain. Understanding this structure, and how it responds to disruption, is important for tackling illnesses like diabetes and posttraumatic stress disorder. The scientists have also found that disruption to these rhythms such as shifts in work schedules or blue light exposure at night can negatively impact overall health. The research was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science. ""The SCN has been so challenging to understand because the cells within it are incredibly noisy,"" said John Abel, first author of the paper and graduate student at SEAS. ""There are more than 20,000 neurons in the SCN, each of which not only generates their own autonomous circadian oscillations but also communicates with other neurons to maintain stable phase lengths and relationships. We were able to cut through that noise and figure out which cells share information with each other."" The SCN looks like a miniature brain, with two hemispheres, inside the hypothalamus. It receives light cues from the retina to help it keep track of time and reset when necessary. When functioning probably, the neurons inside both hemispheres oscillate in a synchronized pattern. Learn More: New  reset  button discovered for circadian clock Neurons in the SCN resynchronize after being exposed to a neurotoxin. Courtesy: The Doyle lab  In order to understand the structure of the network, Abel and the team had to disrupt that pattern. The researchers used a potent neurotoxin commonly found in pufferfish to desynchronize the neurons in each hemisphere, turning the steady, rhythmic pulse of oscillations into a cacophony of disconnected beats. The team then removed the toxin and observed the network as it reestablished communication, using information theory to figure out which cells had to communicate to resynchronize the whole network. ""It's like trying to figure out if a group of people are friends without being able to look at their phone calls or their text messages,"" Abel said. ""In a large group of other people, you might not be able to tell who is in contact with each other, but if a certain group shows up together at a party, you can probably assume they're friends because they show similar behavior."" By observing the SCN at single-cell resolution, Abel and the team identified a core group of very friendly neurons in the center of each hemisphere that share a lot of information during resynchronization. They also observed dense connections between the hubs of each hemisphere. The neurons outside these central hubs, in the area called the shell, behaved more like acquaintances than friends, sharing little information amongst themselves. Related: Biologists explore link between memory deficit and misfiring circadian clock ""We were surprised to find that the shell lacked a functionally connected cluster of neurons,"" said Abel. ""We've known that exposure to an artificially long day can split the SCN into core and shell phase clusters which oscillate out of sync with each other. We've assumed that the neurons in the shell communicated to synchronize that rhythm but our research suggests that phase clustering in the shell is actually mediated by the core neurons."" Previous research also assumed that the core SCN was dominant only due to its role in receiving light cues from the eyes. By using the neurotoxin to disrupt circadian rhythms, Abel and the team demonstrated that the core is the key to resynchronization even without light cues. ""For the last 15 years our group has been studying the complex control mechanisms that are responsible for the generation of robust circadian rhythms in the brain,"" said Frank Doyle, the John A. Paulson Dean and John A. & Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor of Engineering & Applied Sciences, who co-authored the paper. ""This work brings us one step closer to reverse engineering those paradigms by elucidating the topology of communication amongst neurons, thus demonstrating the importance of a systems perspective to link genes to cells to the SCN tissue.""

Now, a University of Missouri (MU) research team has determined that children and adolescents physically react to their social networks and the stress those networks may cause. Scientists believe that the quality and size of the social relationships nurtured in childhood may have important physiological consequences for physical and mental health for youth. See Also: Stress resiliency and susceptibility: The neurocircuitry underlying the detrimental effects of chronic stress Cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase are secreted in response to outside pressure or tension. A part of the autonomic nervous system, release of cortisol in the system is quick, unconscious and can be measured in saliva; therefore, measuring cortisol is a good indicator of stress in the body, said Mark V. Flinn, professor of biomedical anthropology and chair of the Department of Anthropology in the MU College of Arts and Science. ""The typical physiological response to stress is the release of hormones like cortisol into the system,"" Flinn said. ""In this study, we wanted to explore the association between children's personal social networks, as well as perceived social network size and density with biomarkers like cortisol and alpha-amylase that can indicate levels of stress in youth. Our goal was to determine if children experience stress because they perceive their networks to be inferior compared to their peers. Determining if social relationships cause stress in children is important because stress can influence human behavior and health later in life."" Flinn and his team, including Davide Ponzi, a post-doctoral fellow who is now with the University of Utah, have been conducting a one-of-a-kind project on an island in the Caribbean. For the study, the team has been using data collected over more than two decades from a small village on the east coast of Dominica. For years, Flinn has integrated himself within the culture, documenting socioeconomic, demographic, and health data as well as relationship data within a small community of about 500 residents. ""Over the years, we've collected data on grandparents, parents and their children; I've observed real kids in their communities, not in a controlled laboratory setting, so the data is unique and highly useful,"" Flinn said.

Three samples of saliva were collected before, during and after the interview and cortisol and alpha-amylase levels were measured. ""We found that, using the data we collected from the one-on-one interviews, children who were stressed about the size and density of their perceived social networks had elevated anticipatory cortisol levels, and responded by secreting more alpha-amylase,"" Flinn said.

That's the conclusion of a new study that tracked developing cells in an adult mouse brain in real time. New brain cells began with a period of overgrowth, sending out a plethora of neuronal branches, before the brain pruned back the connections. The observation, described in Nature Neuroscience, suggests that new cells in the adult brain have more in common with those in the embryonic brain than scientists previously thought and could have implications for understanding diseases including autism, intellectual disabilities and schizophrenia. See Also: An initiation mechanism for dendritic spines discovered ""We were surprised by the extent of the pruning we saw,"" says senior author Rusty Gage, a professor in the Salk Institute's Laboratory of Genetics and holder of the Vi and John Adler Chair for Research on Age-Related Neurodegenerative Disease. While most of the brain's billions of cells are formed before birth, Gage and others previously showed that in a few select areas of the mammalian brain, stem cells develop into new neurons during adulthood. In the new study, Gage's group focused on cells in the dentate gyrus, an area deep in the brain thought to be responsible for the formation of new memories. The scientists used a new microscopy technique to observe new cells being formed in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. ""This is the first time we've been able to image dentate neurons growing in a living animal,"" says Tiago Gon alves, a research associate in the Gage lab and first author of the new paper. Salk scientists show how adult brains prune back branched connections of new neurons. Over a period of over a month, the Salk team kept track of each new neural branch, called a dendrite, on the growing neurons, as well as each dendrite that was pruned away. Here, the branches of one cell are shown new dendrites are in green, those pruned away are orange, and dendrites that both developed and were pruned away since the last snapshot are in pink. Credit: Salk Institute  Gon alves and Gage followed on a daily basis the growth of neurons over several weeks. When animal were housed in environments with lots of stimuli running wheels, plastic tubes, and domes the new cells grew quickly, sending out dozens of dendrites which receive electrical signals from surrounding neurons. When kept in empty housing, the new neurons grew slightly slower and sent out, on average, a few less dendrites. But, in both cases, the dendrites of the new cells began to be pruned back. ""What was really surprising was that the cells that initially grew faster and became bigger were pruned back so that, in the end, they resembled all the other cells,"" says Gon alves. He and his colleagues went on to show that changing signaling pathways could mimic some of the effects of the complex environment cells grew more initially, but also pruned back earlier. Learn More: How neurons get their branching shapes So why would the brain spend energy developing more dendrites than needed? The researchers suspect that the more dendrites a neuron starts with, the more flexibility it has to prune back exactly the right branches. ""The results suggest that there is significant biological pressure to maintain or retain the dendrite tree of these neurons,"" says Gage. Defects in the dendrites of neurons have been linked to numerous brain disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, epilepsy and autism. Charting how the brain shapes these branches both during embryonic development and in adulthood may be the key to understanding mental health. ""This also has big repercussions for regenerative medicine,"" says Gon alves. ""Could we replace cells in this area of the brain with new stem cells and would they develop in the same way? We don't know yet."" Salk Institute  press release Gon alves, JT et al. In vivo imaging of dendritic pruning in dentate granule cells.

It s very difficult to detect these nanomaterials in the environment since the concentrations are so low and the particles so small. Now the partners in the NanoUmwelt project have developed a method that is capable of identifying even minute amounts of nanomaterials in environmental samples. Tiny dwarves keep our mattresses clean, repair damage to our teeth, stop eggs sticking to our pans, and extend the shelf life of our food. We are talking about nanomaterials    nano  comes from the Greek word for  dwarf . These particles are just a few billionths of a meter small, and they are used in a wide range of consumer products. However, up to now the impact of these materials on the environment has been largely unknown, and information is lacking on the concentrations and forms in which they are present there.  It s true that many laboratory studies have examined the effect of nanomaterials on human and animal cells. To date, though, it hasn t been possible to detect very small amounts in environmental samples,  says Dr. Yvonne Kohl from the Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering IBMT in Sulzbach. A millionth of a milligram per liter  That is precisely the objective of the NanoUmwelt project. The interdisciplinary project team is made up of eco- and human toxicologists, physicists, chemists and biologists, and they have just managed to take their first major step forward in achieving their goal: they have developed a method for testing a variety of environmental samples such as river water, animal tissue, or human urine and blood that can detect nanomaterials at a concentration level of nanogram per liter (ppb   parts per billion). That is equivalent to half a sugar cube in the volume of water contained in 1000 competition swimming pools. Using the new method, it is now possible to detect not just large amounts of nanomaterials in clear fluids, as was previously the case, but also very few particles in complex substance mixtures such as human blood or soil samples. The approach is based on field-flow fractionation (FFF), which can be used to separate complex heterogeneous mixtures of fluids and particles into their component parts   while simultaneously sorting the key components by size. This is achieved by the combination of a controlled flow of fluid and a physical separation field, which acts perpendicularly on the flowing suspension. For the detection process to work, environmental samples have to be appropriately processed. The team from Fraunhofer IBMT s Bioprocessing & Bioanalytics Department prepared river water, human urine, and fish tissue to be fit in the FFF device.  We prepare the samples with special enzymes. In this process, we have to make sure that the nanomaterials are not destroyed or changed. This allows us to detect the real amounts and forms of the nanomaterials in the environment,  explains Kohl. The scientists have special expertise when it comes to providing, processing and storing human tissue samples. Fraunhofer IBMT has been running the  German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB)   Human Samples  since January 2012 on behalf of Germany s Environment Agency (UBA). Each year the research institute collects blood and urine samples from 120 volunteers in four cities in Germany. Individual samples are a valuable tool for mapping the trends over time of human exposure to pollutants.  In addition, blood and urine samples have been donated for the NanoUmwelt project and put into cryostorage at Fraunhofer IBMT. We used these samples to develop our new detection method,  says Dr. Dominik Lermen, manager of the working group on Biomonitoring & Cryobanks at Fraunhofer IBMT. After approval by the UBA, some of the human samples in the ESB archive may also be examined using the new method. Developing new cell culture models Nanomaterials end up in the environment via different pathways, inter alia the sewage system. Human beings and animals presumably absorb them through biological barriers such as the lung or intestine. The project team is simulating these processes in petri dishes in order to understand how nanomaterials are transported across these barriers.  It s a very complex process involving an extremely wide range of cells and layers of tissue,  explains Kohl. The researchers replicate the processes in a way as realistic as possible. They do this by, for instance, measuring the electrical flows within the barriers to determine the functionality of these barriers   or by simulating lung-air interaction using clouds of artificial fog. In the first phase of the NanoUmwelt project, the IBMT team succeeded in developing several cell culture models for the transport of nanomaterials across biological barriers. IBMT worked together with the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, which used pluripotent stem cells to develop a model for investigating cardiotoxicity. Empa, the Swiss partner in the project, delivered a placental barrier model for studying the transport of nanomaterials between mother and child.   Next, the partners want to use their method to measure the concentrations of nanoparticles in a wide variety of environmental samples. They will then analyze the results obtained so as to be in a better position to assess the behavior of nanomaterials in the environment and their potential danger for humans, animals, and the environment.  Our next goal is to detect particles in even smaller quantities,  says Kohl. To achieve this, the scientists are planning to use special filters to remove distracting elements from the environmental samples, and they are looking forward to develop new processing techniques.","Published: May 3, 2016"

Other risk factors for bladder cancer, such as smoking and occupational exposures, did not explain the excess risk in this region. The study, by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire; the departments of health for Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; and the U.S. Geological Survey. Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for over half a century. The incidence of bladder cancer in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont has been about 20 percent higher than that in the United States overall. Rates are elevated among both men and women. A unique feature of this region is the high proportion of the population using private wells for their drinking water, which are not maintained by municipalities and are not subject to federal regulations. These wells may contain arsenic, generally at low to moderate levels. Previous studies have shown that consumption of water containing high concentrations of arsenic increases the risk of bladder cancer. There are two possible sources of arsenic in the well water in northern New England. Arsenic can occur naturally, releasing from rock deep in the earth, and arsenic-based pesticides that were used extensively on crops such as blueberries, apples, and potatoes in the 1920s through the 1950s.  Arsenic is an established cause of bladder cancer, largely based on observations from earlier studies in highly exposed populations,  said Debra Silverman, Sc.D., chief of the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, NCI, and senior author on the study.  However, emerging evidence suggests that low to moderate levels of exposure may also increase risk.  To explore the reasons for the higher rates of bladder cancer in northern New England, the researchers conducted a large study in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. They compared 1,213 people newly diagnosed with bladder cancer with 1,418 people without bladder cancer who lived in the same geographic areas as those who developed the disease. The researchers obtained information on known and suspected bladder cancer risk factors, including smoking, occupation, ancestry, use of wood-burning stoves, and consumption of various foods.  Although smoking and employment in high-risk occupations both showed their expected associations with bladder cancer risk in this population, they were similar to those found in other populations,  said Silverman.  This suggests that neither risk factor explains the excess occurrence of bladder cancer in northern New England.  Researchers estimated the total amount of arsenic each person had ingested through drinking water based on current levels and historical information. They found that increasing cumulative exposure was associated with an increasing risk of bladder cancer. When investigators focused on participants who had used private wells, they saw that people who drank the most water had almost twice the risk of those who drank the least. This association was stronger if dug wells had been used. Dug wells are shallow, less than 50 feet deep, and potentially susceptible to contamination from manmade sources. Most of the dug well use occurred a long time ago, during an era when arsenic concentrations in private well water were largely unknown. However, the risk was substantially higher if the dug well use began before 1960 (when application of arsenic-based pesticides was commonplace in this region) than if dug well use started later. The major limitation of the study was the inability to precisely measure arsenic exposure in the water consumed by people over their entire lifetime, which made it challenging to accurately quantify the contribution of arsenic exposure to the excess risk of bladder cancer. In particular, there were no known measurement data on arsenic levels in well water in the region prior to the 1960s, when arsenic-based pesticides were in widespread use. The likelihood of exposure to arsenic from dug wells has diminished in recent years because arsenic-based pesticides are no longer used. Also, dug well use is much less common now than in the past. However, possible current exposure to arsenic in drinking water through use of private wells drilled deeply into fractured bedrock is a potential public health concern. For reference, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established 10 micrograms per liter as the regulatory standard for arsenic in drinking water supplied by municipalities.  There are effective interventions to lower arsenic concentrations in water,  said Silverman.  New England has active public health education campaigns instructing residents to test their water supply and to install and maintain filters if levels are above the EPA threshold. But we should emphasize that smoking remains the most common and strongest risk factor for bladder cancer, and therefore smoking cessation is the best method for reducing bladder cancer risk.

The research team, led by scientists at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom and including representatives from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Colorado, identified more than 5,600 lipids   or fats   in blood platelets and gained new insights into how these cells respond to aspirin.  Aspirin is a widely used cardiovascular preventive drug and also has an emerging role in cancer treatment and prevention,  said Valerie O Donnell, Ph.D., Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University, and the study s lead author.  Understanding how people respond to aspirin is key in terms of knowing who will benefit from it.  The findings, published April 28 in Cell Metabolism, are the first comprehensive lipidomic profile of human platelets in response to stimulation and aspirin treatment.  Our research shows a new link between energy metabolism and inflammation, as well as giving early insights into the fundamentals of precision medicine regarding the variation of the lipidome among individuals,  said Victor Darley-Usmar, Ph.D., Endowed Professor of Mitochondrial Medicine and Pathology at UAB and a co-investigator on the study. Lipids play essential structural roles, act as nutrients, and control a broad range of physiological and pathophysiological events in cells, according to the researchers.  While several lipid families are well-characterized at the molecular level, the total diversity and number of unique lipids in cells, how they change during cellular activation, and how they differ in individuals is unknown,  said Darley-Usmar.  This hampers integration of lipidomics into systems biology, and addressing it will improve our fundamental understanding of lipid biology, help identify new drug targets for therapy and discover lipid biomarkers from disease cohorts.   This work led by Professor O Donnell is a technical tour de force, providing a wonderful resource for other biomedical researchers,  said Mike Murphy, Ph.D., programme leader, Mitochondrial Biology Unit at Cambridge University, U.K.  A particularly important aspect is the focus on platelets, which are readily available from patients  blood in diagnosis, prognosis or as a biomarker in assessing therapies. In addition to its future use, this work also demonstrated an unexpected link between mitochondrial fat metabolism and platelet activation during inflammation.   Given the importance of aspirin as both a cardioprotective and possible cancer therapeutic, a full understanding of how it regulates platelet lipids will be the focus of a follow-on study with a larger number of volunteers,  said Robert Murphy, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado, and a study co-investigator.  The stability of the global lipidome with age, diet and over time is unknown, and the influence of external factors such as epigenetic control of lipid metabolizing enzymes could be considerable.  The research was funded by the European Research Council and Wellcome Trust.","Published: May 3, 2016"

Scientists hope visualising cancer genomes in this way will one day lead to more effective, personalised cancer treatments. The largest-ever study to sequence the whole genomes of breast cancers has uncovered five new genes associated with the disease and 13 new mutational signatures that influence tumour development. The results of two papers published in Nature and Nature Communications also reveal what genetic variations exist in breast cancers and where they occur in the genome. Dr Serena Nik-Zainal of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute led analysis of 560 breast cancer genomes; 556 from women and four from men. This international collaboration included breast cancer patients from around the world, including the USA, Europe and Asia. The results reveal more about the causes of breast tumours and provide evidence that breast cancer genomes are highly individual. Each person s cancer genome is a complete historical account of the genetic changes that they have acquired throughout life. As a person develops from a fertilised egg into adulthood, the DNA in their cells gather genetic changes along the way. This is because human DNA is constantly being damaged by things in the environment or simply from wear and tear in the cell. These mutations form patterns, or mutational signatures, that we can detect and they give us clues about the causes of cancer. Dr Nik-Zainal s team hunted for mutations that encourage cancers to grow and looked for mutational signatures in each patient s tumour. They found that women who carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, and so have increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, had whole cancer genome profiles that were highly distinctive from each other and were also very different to other breast cancers. This discovery could be used to classify patients more accurately for treatment.  In the future, we d like to be able to profile individual cancer genomes so that we can identify the treatment most likely to be successful for a woman or man diagnosed with breast cancer. It is a step closer to personalised healthcare for cancer.  Dr Serena Nik-Zainal of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Exactly where mutations occur in breast cancer genomes is important too. Collaborator Dr Ewan Birney, from the European Bioinformatics Institute, used computational techniques to analyse the sequence of genetic information held in each of the sample genomes.  We know genetic changes and their position in the cancer genome influence how a person responds to a cancer therapy. For years we have been trying to figure out if parts of DNA that don t code for anything specific have a role in driving cancer development. This study both gave us the first large scale view of the rest of the genome, uncovering some new reasons why breast cancer arises, and gave us an unexpected way to characterize the types of mutations that happen in certain breast cancers.  Dr Ewan Birney, from the European Bioinformatics Institute  All cancers are due to mutations that occur in all of us in the DNA of our cells during the course of our lifetimes. Finding these mutations is crucial to understanding the causes of cancer and to developing improved therapies. This huge study, examining in great detail the many thousands of mutations present in each of the genomes of 560 cases brings us much closer to a complete description of the changes in DNA in breast cancer and thus to a comprehensive understanding of the causes of the disease and the opportunities for new treatments.

The discovery of these shared properties offer the opportunity to broaden our understanding of the biological basis of disease and identify new therapeutic targets,  saidYves A. Lussier, MD, FACMI, lead and senior corresponding author of the study and UAHS associate vice president for health sciences and director of the UAHS Center for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics (CB2). The researchers are striving to better understand the common genetic and biological backgrounds that make certain people susceptible to the same disease. They have developed a method to demonstrate how individual, disease-associated DNA variants share similar biological properties that provide a road map for disease origin. Over the last ten years, genetics researchers have conducted large studies, called Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), which analyze DNA variants across thousands of human genomes to identify those that are more frequent in people with a disease. However, the impact of many of these disease-associated variants on the function and regulation of genes remains elusive, making clinical interpretation difficult. A method to explore the biological impact of these variants and how they are linked to disease was developed through the collaboration of bioinformatics and systems biology researchers Dr. Lussier;Haiquan Li, PhD, research associate professor and director for translational bioinformatics, Department of Medicine, UA College of Medicine   Tucson; Ikbel Achour, PhD, director for precision health, CB2;Jason H. Moore, PhD, director, Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; and Joshua C. Denny, MD, MS, FACMI, associate professor of biomedical informatics and medicine, Vanderbilt University, along with their teams. In their new paper, the researchers demonstrate that DNA risk variants can affect biological activities such as gene expression and cellular machinery, which together provide a more comprehensive picture of disease biology. When DNA risk variants for a given disease were analyzed in combination, similar biological activities were discovered, suggesting that distinct risk variants can affect the same or shared biological functions and thus cause the same disease. More detailed analyses of variants linked to bladder cancer, Alzheimer s disease and rheumatoid arthritis showed that two variants can contribute to disease independently, but also interact genetically. Therefore, the precise combination of DNA variants of a patient may work to increase or decrease the relative risk of disease. The team of researchers also is pursuing the development of methods to unveil the biological incidence of  long-time overlooked  DNA variants with the aim to more precisely inform clinical decisions with treatments tailored to a patient s genetic and biological background. Since two of these research teams (Lussier s and Denny s) recently committed to the White House Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), this innovative study demonstrates how strategic collaboration is key to making precision medicine a reality, noted Dr. Lussier. The paper,  Integrative genomics analyses unveil downstream biological effectors of disease-specific polymorphisms buried in intergenic regions,  has been identified as one of the best 30 of the year in computational biology and bioinformatics, and will be presented as a  highlight of the year  at the 2016 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, the largest international conference of computational biology/bioinformatics, in July in Orlando, Fla.","Published: May 3, 2016"

Without that, it s like planning to fight a war against an enemy you ve never seen. Using a broad spectrum of analytical tools, scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have shown how sometimes small, often practically imperceptible, structural changes in a key breast cancer receptor are directly linked to regulating molecules and can produce predictable effects in curbing or accelerating cancer growth. This predictive statistical approach, published recently in the journal Molecular Systems Biology, moves science one step closer to the development of more effective structure-based drug design to treat the disease.  Our long-term goal,  said team leader Kendall Nettles, an associate professor at TSRI,  is to be able to predict proliferative or anti-proliferative activity of receptor molecule complexes by identifying structural changes that lead to specific outcomes. In many cases, we can identify structural features that could help guide more effective drug development.  To identify the root of estrogen receptor (ER ) cell signaling that drives breast cancer cell proliferation, Nettles and his colleagues synthesized more than 240 estrogen receptor binding molecules ( ligands ) that led the cancer to proliferate, using structural analysis to determine the basis for receptor activity. Many current drugs target signaling proteins like the estrogen receptor. For example, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex , AstraZeneca) blocks the estrogen receptor s proliferative effects of naturally occurring estrogen in breast cancer cells, but can increase the risk of uterine cancer. Research Associate Sathish Srinivasan, a co-first author of the study with Research Associate Jerome Nwachukwu, pointed out the new research suggests that certain structural changes might be made to the binding pocket to eliminate this negative side effect.  Drugs like tamoxifen can have different effects in different tissues because of structural changes often not discernable using traditional methods,  Srinivasan said.  Our approach reveals some mechanisms associated with tissue specificity and several predictive structural features."" To further test these signaling models, the team solved the atomic structure of some 76 different estrogen receptor-ligand complexes to better understand these responses.  We can predict some of these effects by measuring the distance between two specific carbon atoms of the estrogen receptor,  said Nwachukwu. Nettles concluded,  This is the first time we have been able to use these atomic structures to identify how very small changes from the ligands give different outcomes, leading us towards the goal of predicting which ligands are going to make the most effective treatments for breast cancer.

One of the best-supported theories to explain this peculiar public health pattern has been dubbed the hygiene hypothesis. The theory is based on the premise that exposure to pathogens early in life is actually beneficial to the education and development of the human immune system. - Exposure to bacteria may play a pivotal role in the immune system, and that we might be able to understand what that role is by studying the human microbiome, says Aleksandar Kostic, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Ramnik Xavier at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The work is the product of an extensive collaboration involving researchers at Aalto University, Broad Institute, University of Helsinki, the Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, and other organizations across the globe working together as part of the DIABIMMUNE Study Group. By looking at the gut microbiomes of infants from three different countries, the team uncovered evidence that not only supports the hygiene hypothesis, but also points to interactions among bacterial species that may account, at least in part, for the spike in immune disorders seen in western societies. Silent microbiomes The DIABIMMUNE Study Group recruited and began collecting monthly stool samples from infants in each of the three countries: Finland, Estonia and Russian Karelia. Along with the samples, from which they would identify and quantify the bacteria that made up the infants  gut microbiomes, they also collected lab tests and questionnaires about such topics as breastfeeding, diet, allergies, infections, and family history. They evaluated all of this data, which was collected from birth to age three from over 200 infants, to see whether connections might exist between disease incidence and what they found in the microbiome. By characterizing the microbial content of the stool samples, the team found a sharp distinction between the microbiomes of Finnish and Estonian infants and their Russian Karelian counterparts: the gut microbiomes of the Finnish and Estonian infants were dominated by Bacteroides species, while Russian Karelian infants had an overrepresentation of Bifidobacterium early in life and an overall greater variability in their microbiomes over the course of the three years that samples were collected. - We can only speculate why this difference in bacterial populations exists; what we could show was what implications that difference in populations might have, says Tommi Vatanen, a Doctoral candidate at the Aalto University and Broad who was a co-first author of the Cell study. LPS has been well-known for its ability to trigger the immune system that LPS from the bacteria E. coli is commonly used to stimulate immune cells in laboratory experiments. But, it turns out, not all LPS are created equal. When the researchers looked at LPS signaling in the Russian Karelian microbiome, they saw a familiar pattern: E. coli LPS led the charge, likely performing its usual role triggering the immune response. However, when the researchers looked at LPS signaling in the Finnish and Estonian microbiomes, they found that the LPS from the Bacteroides species ruled the roost. What s more, they discovered that the particular form of LPS found in Bacteroides fails to activate the immune system and even stifles the immune-activating LPS from the E. coli and other bacteria living in those communities. - We believe that E. coli, which lives in the infant gut in all three countries, might be one of the immune educating bacteria responsible for training the immune system early in life. But, we found that if you mix Bacteroides with E. coli it can actually inhibit the immune-activating properties of E. Coli, and we suspect this might have consequences on the development of the immune system, Vatanen explains. - In the Finnish and Estonian infants, where Bacteroides dominates, the gut microbiome is immunologically very silent, Kostic adds, and continues - We believe that, later on, this makes them more prone to strong inflammatory stimuli. The researchers suspect that the LPS immune activation by E. coli seen in the Russian Karelian infants is reflective of the relationship humans developed with microbiota over the course of human evolution. The prevalence and dominance of Bacteroides, in contrast, is a more recent phenomenon related in some way to improved sanitation and standard of living. The researchers say that they would next like to investigate how and why Bacteroides has come to dominate in the infant gut in these westernized countries. They also plan to expand their studies to include other geographic regions and hope to uncover additional mechanisms that help explain the connection between the microbiome and immune-related disease.","Published: May 3, 2016"

That may be fine for lab research, but it poses an unacceptable contamination risk for stem cells intended for transplant into human patients. In a new study, Brown University bioengineers have developed a synthetic bed that works about as well as the mouse cells, called fibroblasts, without any possibility of contamination.  The gold standard for making the best stem cells would be starting with embryonic stem cells and growing them on a mouse embryonic fibroblast layer,  said Diane Hoffman-Kim, associate professor of medical science and of engineering.  If we could understand the elements of that gold standard, then we could try to make an off-the-shelf product.  That potential product would be one that could advance stem cell therapies by taking mice out of the picture, said Hoffman-Kim, co-corresponding author with Eric Darling, also an associate professor of medical science and of engineering at Brown. The researchers, led by Hoffman-Kim s former doctoral student Cristina Lopez-Fagundo, describe their advance in the journal Acta Biomaterialia. It turns out the key elements of the mouse fibroblasts that they learned to mimic were the stiffness of the cells and the bumpiness of the bed they formed. By spreading a specially made material over the fibroblasts, the scientists created a rubbery mold. When they then used that to create beds with similar properties to a real one, they saw that that they could nurture and sustain comparable   though not identical   colonies of embryonic mouse stem cells on them.  This is not the gold standard, and we re not saying it is,  Lopez-Fagundo said,  But it definitely makes up for the disadvantages of culturing with mouse embryonic fibroblasts.  Measuring the mimic Experiments showed that the stem cell colonies nurtured on the synthetic beds were somewhat smaller in number at first but sometimes larger in area. By three weeks of culturing, both colony number and area were similar between the two. A third bed included as an experimental control, a surface with the optimal stiffness but no bumpiness, utterly failed to nurture the cells. The next set of experiments tested whether the mouse embryonic stem cell colonies reared on synthetic or gold-standard fibroblast beds would mature comparably well. The team was able to show that they could induce stem cells from either bed to differentiate into each of the three  germ layers,  which are precursors to tissue: the endoderm, which becomes internal body structures such as the gastrointestinal tract; the mesoderm, which becomes many organ systems, including the heart; and the ectoderm, which becomes the nervous system. More to come Hoffman-Kim and Lopez-Fagundo acknowledge they have more work to do before their advance can become useful for increasing stem cell production for clinical use. They ve begun to test the synthetic bed with non-embryonic human stem cells that have similar potential to become different tissues as embryonic ones. Demonstrating the technology with human cells is a crucial step. They also want to answer a more fundamental question: What is it about the stiffness of fibroblasts and the bumpiness of the layer they form that is so important in nurturing stem cell colonies? To learn that would be to reveal at least one of the many unknowns of stem cell biology.  Right now in the field we are still at a frontier in terms of culturing and using stem cells,  Hoffman-Kim said.  It s not fully resolved yet. ","Published: May 3, 2016"

Turvey is also a professor in UBC s Faculty of Medicine, and a pediatric immunologist, senior clinician scientist and director of clinical research at BC Children s Hospital.  This research will help us learn about the changes that we can make to a child s environment to reduce their susceptibility to the disease.  With this funding, Turvey and his colleagues will use data and samples from the CHILD Studyto examine how a child s environment interacts with the genome, a science known as epigenetics, to affect the development of asthma.

This research will build on recent findings out of UBC and at BC Children s Hospital that found babies with four strains of bacteria in their gut are less likely to develop asthma. Other UBC research has also found that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and to antibiotics early in life are linked to a child s asthma risk.

Like this, cell lysis is not needed and protein complexes are preserved during purification.  With his feet in both a proteomics lab and an interactomics lab, VIB/UGent professor Sven Eyckerman is well aware of the shortcomings of conventional approaches to analyze protein complexes. The lysis conditions required in mass spectrometry based strategies to break open cell membranes often affect protein-protein interactions.  The first step in a classical study on protein complexes essentially turns the highly organized cellular structure into a big messy soup , Eyckerman explains.  Inspired by virus biology, Eyckerman came up with a creative solution.  We used the natural process of HIV particle formation to our benefit by hacking a completely safe form of the virus to abduct intact protein machines from the cell.  It is well known that the HIV virus captures a number of host proteins during its particle formation. By fusing a bait protein to the HIV-1 GAG protein, interaction partners become trapped within virus-like particles that bud from mammalian cells. Standard proteomic approaches are used next to reveal the content of these particles. Fittingly, the team named the method  Virotrap . The Virotrap approach is exceptional as protein networks can be characterized under natural conditions. By trapping protein complexes in the protective environment of a virus-like shell, the intact complexes are preserved during the purification process. The researchers showed the method was suitable for detection of known binary interactions as well as mass spectrometry-based identification of novel protein partners.  Virotrap is a textbook example of bringing research teams with complementary expertise together. Cross-pollination with the labs of Jan Tavernier (VIB/UGent) and Kris Gevaert (VIB/UGent) enabled the development of this platform. Jan Tavernier:  Virotrap represents a new concept in co-complex analysis wherein complex stability is physically guaranteed by a protective, physical structure. It is complementary to the arsenal of existing interactomics methods, but also holds potential for other fields, like drug target characterization. We also developed a small molecule-variant of Virotrap that could successfully trap protein partners for small molecule baits.  Kris Gevaert:  Virotrap can also impact our understanding of disease pathways. We were actually surprised to see that this virus-based system could be used to study antiviral pathways, like Toll-like receptor signaling. Understanding these protein machines in their natural environment is essential if we want to modulate their activity in pathology. ","Published: May 3, 2016"

How our DNA is stored and packaged in the nucleus can be viewed as two different states: regions of the genome that are  open for business  and can be actively read, and regions that are locked away by being tightly packed and inaccessible to the factors that read DNA. The researchers looked in detail at the mysterious tightly packed portions of the genome, called constitutive heterochromatin. Previous research has shown that heterochromatin is maintained in an unusually open and uncompacted organisation in embryonic stem cells, which is different to all other cell types. It is thought that this rare form of genome architecture may contribute to keeping stem cells in an unspecialised state, still full of the potential to become any cell type in the body. Why heterochromatin is organised in this way in embryonic stem cells has previously been unknown.  As described in the journal Genes & Development, the researchers identified a new pathway controlling heterochromatin organisation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Unexpectedly, this pathway assigns new roles for several well-known stem cell factors. The research showed that the stem cell factors, Nanog and Sall1, bind to heterochromatin and help to maintain this portion of the genome in an open form. Embryonic stem cells lacking Nanog and Sall1 showed major defects in heterochromatin organisation, including the closure and compaction of the chromatin. These new findings uncover the first direct connection between stem cell factors and the control of genome architecture, and explains why stem cell heterochromatin is normally in an open and uncompacted form. Loss of heterochromatin regulation has potential consequences for the long-term genetic stability of stem cells, and the ability of stem cells to mature into specialised cell types. Dr Peter Rugg-Gunn, senior author on the research paper and research group leader at the Babraham Institute explained:  This unanticipated connection between stem cell factors and heterochromatin organisation is important because it tells us about how stem cells work. By tapping into this newly identified connection, we open up new avenues for more successful reprogramming of adult cells to a stem cell state, which is a priority for future regenerative medicine approaches.

Now, investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) have developed a promising method of identifying new antimicrobials that target these organisms. The research is published in April issue of the journal ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies. CRE are Gram-negative bacteria that frequently express a gene that codes for carbapenemase an enzyme that breaks down carbapenem and other antibiotics and that is located on  mobile genetic elements  called plasmids, which can jump from one bacterium to another. The two most common types of CRE are carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella species and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli. Patients who become infected with these bacteria have few antibiotic treatment options.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently classified these carbapenem-resistant organisms in their highest, most urgent antimicrobial resistance threat level,  said James Kirby, MD, Director of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at BIDMC and an Associate Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.  Unfortunately, often either no effective or only toxic antimicrobial options remain for CRE treatment. Moreover, CRE are particularly frightening as they are now increasing in prevalence across the United States and the world.  While there is a critical need for new antimicrobial agents against CRE and other emerging antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the number of new antibiotics that have been developed and approved has steadily decreased in recent decades. To identify new or existing drugs that can destroy multidrug-resistant CRE, Kirby and postdoctoral fellow Kenneth Smith, PhD examined approximately 10,000 compounds with known activity so called known bioactive molecules including most previously FDA-approved drugs, veterinary drugs and inhibitors of various cellular processes not currently used as therapeutics.  Through a process called high throughput screening, the investigators looked to see whether any of these compounds could either directly inhibit the growth of CRE or restore the effectiveness of carbapenem against these organisms.   From these screening experiments, 79 compounds were found to inhibit CRE. Of these, three had already been approved for human and veterinary use: azidothymidine (also known as AZT, a therapy for HIV infection), spectinomycin (a treatment for gonorrhea infection) and apramycin (a veterinary antimicrobial). When tested against a large number of CRE strains, the three compounds were broadly active against the strains.    These antimicrobials currently have other intended uses and are not currently considered as treatments for CRE, however our findings suggest they could potentially be repurposed for CRE treatment,  said Smith. Apramycin and spectinomycin are of particular interest because they have minimal side effects, making them potentially ideal new therapeutic options for CRE infection.  Smith added that while these drugs might be used by themselves to treat CRE infection, they could also be used as starting points for further drug development.  Specifically, these antibiotics could be structurally modified to further increase their activity and prevent resistance from developing against them,  he explained. The next step in this line of research is to examine the potency of the identified drugs in an animal model of CRE infection.  We are also using the same high throughput screening technology to investigate a collection of more than 200,000 completely novel compounds with as yet uncharacterized biological activity in the hopes of identifying new classes of compounds with potent activity against CRE and other multi-drug resistant pathogens,  Kirby said.

The group published their findings this month in npj Genomic Medicine. Drugs can have variable effects on people depending on small natural differences in the sequence of DNA between individuals. These genetic differences are called SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, and are variants in the DNA alphabet of A, T, C, and G molecules that occur naturally among individuals. Many such SNPs have been associated with disease risk, for instance showing that a person with an A at a given location in the DNA sequence has a higher risk of diabetes compared with someone with a G. However, these disease-related SNPs often reside in the so-called  dark matter  of the genome that does not directly code for genes, but does include switches that control gene expression. Over the last ten years, researchers have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) to map DNA variants across thousands of genomes from individuals to find which variants are more frequent in people with a certain disease. For such common, complex diseases as diabetes or cancer, GWAS have identified hundreds such variants. On the other hand, GWAS have found that many disease-associated variants do not alter the function of genes in an obvious way, making some variants difficult for immediate clinical interpretation. Senior author Jason H. Moore, PhD, the Edward Rose Professor of Informatics and director of the Institute for Biomedical Informatics and colleagues Yves A. Lussier, Haiquan Li, Ikbel Achour, and Joshua C. Denny have developed a computational method to explore the downstream effects of variants associated with risk to reveal possible mechanisms of disease.  Our results provide a  roadmap  of disease mechanisms emerging from GWAS to identify candidate therapeutic targets,  Moore said. In the current paper, the team demonstrated that variants associated with disease risk can affect such biological activities as gene expression and the function of proteins in cellular house-keeping machinery.  Taking this all together a more comprehensive picture of disease biology is emerging,  Moore said.  This picture   up to now   has been blurry, especially when variants occurred between genes.  The team used computational modelling of two million pairs of disease-associated SNPs drawn from three GWAS projects, as well as information from other genome databases that match a patient s individual genetic makeup to their outward symptoms. From this, they predicted 3,870 SNP pairs with a similar biological mechanism. These prioritized SNP pairs, with overlapping messenger RNA targets or similar functions, were more likely to be associated with the same disease than unrelated pathologies.","Published: May 3, 2016"

John Snow, widely regarded as the one of the first epidemiologists (and somewhat of a folk hero in scientific circles), conducted one of the first known epidemiologic investigations during a London cholera outbreak in 1854. He went door to door, mapping cases of illness, and ultimately identified a water pump at the center of the outbreak. These same fundamentals of so-called  shoe-leather epidemiology  are used every day by health departments, government agencies and research teams around the world to identify and track outbreaks. Thanks to improvements in the speed and cost of DNA analysis, these old methods are increasingly being paired with genomic technology. Today, genetic sequencing allows us to determine how an infection travels   even tracing it across continents   with incredible precision. The molecular clock   a stopwatch for infection Viruses and bacteria contain DNA and RNA, which means they can evolve. As viruses and bacteria make copies of themselves, their molecular material changes. This is because the enzyme that copies DNA and RNA makes random errors as the virus or bacteria replicates. This evolution is akin to the development of mammals over evolutionary history, but with an important difference. The lifespan of a bacterium or virus is short, and they replicate quickly in astonishing quantities. This means we can observe evolutionary change in as short a span as just a few hours or days. This constant change is called a molecular clock. Once an infection is transmitted to a new victim, starting a new branch on that infection s genetic tree, the clock starts anew and continues to tick until the victim s body defeats the infection or until the infection kills the victim. We can observe this change directly by sequencing infections in different people and comparing how similar or different they are. This is work that is done by my laboratory and many others around the world. We assume that infections with similar sequences come from the same location at the same time, giving clues into when an infection entered a particular area, or how an infection traveled from one group of people to another. For viruses with a very high mutation rate, the detective work can get more complicated. A single person s infection will evolve to the point where he or she has many different versions of the pathogen in the body, and only one copy, with one genetic version, may actually infect another person. Investigating these types of viruses requires the latest technology in whole-genome sequencing technology and bioinformatics, the computational analysis required to interpret large amounts of sequence data. Tracing outbreaks both old and new Genetic analysis has lead scientists to hypothesize that Zika probably entered Brazil during a 2014 international canoe competition, likely carried by a person from French Polynesia or another Pacific Island. Genetic analysis also pinpointed that cholera was introduced into Haiti by peacekeepers after the 2010 earthquake, linked through sequencing data. Tracing how an infection moves into and through a country or a group of people helps public health officials determine what interventions may work to prevent future spread. Genomics have even busted myths about disease, such as the oft-repeated story of Patient Zero, the man who purportedly introduced HIV into the United States in the 1980s. Molecular clock calculations have shown this scenario to be incorrect. It turns out HIV had been circulating in the United States since the late 1960s, over a decade before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified the first AIDS cases. One of my favorite examples of the power of genetic detective work is the studies of the measles virus before and after vaccination largely eliminated the disease in the United States. Before the measles vaccine was developed, the virus was common, spreading from person to person within the U.S. After the introduction of the vaccine in 1963, the virus largely disappeared, with the occasional resurgence in areas where vaccination rates are low. The genetics of the virus tell us that U.S. measles cases after 1963 are mostly due to people with infections traveling to the U.S. from other countries, rather than spreading from person to person within the U.S. When sequencing technology was first available, it was a long and expensive process that could clarify outbreaks only in hindsight. Now, it is inexpensive and fast enough to use while an outbreak is ongoing. During the measles outbreak that began at Disneyland in California in December 2014, the CDC was able to quickly determine that it started with a strain similar to measles cases in the Philippines, where measles outbreaks are more common. We can even use genomics on a case-by-case basis to tell whether one person infected another, because infections on either side of a transmission event will be more similar to each other than to unrelated samples. This technology has already been useful in untangling the spread of hospital-associated infections, which occur within notoriously complex webs of connections and risk factors. Whole-genome sequencing allows researchers to trace these infections as they move from one patient to another. Hopefully future developments will allow us to identify and interrupt these chains of transmission in real time. We still need old-fashioned shoe-leather epidemiology Even with all of the advances in sequencing over the past decade, our ability to conduct genetic investigations is only as good as our public health infrastructure. The most advanced technologies are useless without ongoing disease surveillance. A trained, funded and sustainable public health workforce must be in place to identify outbreaks early, collect samples and respond quickly to interrupt transmission. Molecular epidemiology works only to the extent that samples are collected for researchers to use to compare and contrast sequences. When outbreaks are not identified early, or when the right samples aren t collected, the investigation will be unable to find links between people in the outbreak and the source of the infection. We need both cutting-edge genetic technology and centuries-old epidemiologic methods to continue to work to stop the spread of infectious diseases.","Published: May 3, 2016"

A team of engineers at Washington University in St. Louis has found a sustainable way to boost the growth of a protein-rich bean by improving the way it absorbs much-needed nutrients. Ramesh Raliya, a research scientist, and Pratim Biswas, the Lucy & Stanley Lopata Professor and chair of the Department of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering, both in the School of Engineering & Applied Science, discovered a way to reduce the use of fertilizer made from rock phosphorus and still see improvements in the growth of food crops by using zinc oxide nanoparticles. The research was published April 7 in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Raliya said this is the first study to show how to mobilize native phosphorus in the soil using zinc oxide nanoparticles over the life cycle of the plant, from seed to harvest. Food crops need phosphorus to grow, and farmers are using more and more phosphorus-based fertilizer as they increase crops to feed a growing world population. However, the plants can only use about 42 percent of the phosphorus applied to the soil, so the rest runs off into the water streams, where it grows algae that pollutes our water sources. In addition, nearly 82 percent of the world s phosphorus is used as fertilizer, but it is a limited supply, Raliya says.  If farmers use the same amount of phosphorus as they re using now, the world s supply will be depleted in about 80 years,  Raliya said.  Now is the time for the world to learn how to use phosphorus in a more sustainable manner.  Raliya and his collaborators, including Jagadish Chandra Tarafdar at the Central Arid Zone Research Institute in Jodhpur, India, created zinc oxide nanoparticles from a fungus around the plant s root that helps the plant mobilize and take up the nutrients in the soil. Zinc also is an essential nutrient for plants because it interacts with three enzymes that mobilize the complex form of phosphorus in the soil into a form that plants can absorb.  Due to climate change, the daily temperature and rainfall amounts have changed,  Raliya said.  When they changed, the microflora in the soil are also changed, and once those are depleted, the soil phosphorus can t mobilize the phosphorus, so the farmer applies more. Our goal is to increase the activity of the enzymes by several-fold, so we can mobilize the native phosphorus several-fold.  When Raliya and the team applied the zinc nanoparticles to the leaves of the mung bean plant, it increased the uptake of the phosphorus by nearly 11 percent and the activity of the three enzymes by 84 percent to 108 percent. That leads to a lesser need to add phosphorus on the soil, Raliya said.  When the enzyme activity increases, you don t need to apply the external phosphorus, because it s already in the soil, but not in an available form for the plant to uptake,  he said.  When we apply these nanoparticles, it mobilizes the complex form of phosphorus to an available form.  The mung bean is a legume grown mainly in China, southeast Asia and India, where 60 percent of the population is vegetarian and relies on plant-based protein sources. The bean is adaptable to a variety of climate conditions and is very affordable for people to grow. Raliya said 45 percent of the worldwide phosphorus use for agriculture takes place in India and China. Much of the phosphorus supply in developing countries is imported from the United States and Morocco-based rock phosphate mines.  We hope that this method of using zinc oxide nanoparticles can be deployed in developing countries where farmers are using a lot of phosphorus,  Raliya said.  These countries are dependent on the U.S. to export phosphorus to them, but in the future, the U.S. may have to help supply food, as well. If this crop can grow in a more sustainable manner, it will be helpful for everyone.   This is a broader effort under way at the nexus of food, energy and water,  Biswas said.  Nanoparticle technology enabled by aerosol science helps develop innovative solutions to address this global challenge problem that we face today. ","Published: May 3, 2016"

The research lays the groundwork for one day being able to regenerate lost or damaged cells with pharmaceutical drugs. In two studies published in Science and Cell Stem Cell, the team of scientists, who were led by Gladstone senior investigator Sheng Ding, PhD, and are part of the Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone, used chemical cocktails to gradually coax skin cells to change into organ-specific stem cell-like cells and, ultimately, into heart or brain cells. This discovery offers a more efficient and reliable method to reprogram cells and avoids medical concerns surrounding genetic engineering.  This method brings us closer to being able to generate new cells at the site of injury in patients,  said Ding, the senior author on both studies.  Our hope is to one day treat diseases like heart failure or Parkinson s disease with drugs that help the heart and brain regenerate damaged areas from their own existing tissue cells. This process is much closer to the natural regeneration that happens in animals like newts and salamanders, which has long fascinated us.  Chemically Repaired Hearts Adult hearts have a very limited ability to generate new cells, so scientists have searched for a way to replace cells lost after a heart attack, such as transplanting adult heart cells or stem cells into the damaged heart. However, these efforts have been largely ineffective, as most transplanted adult cells do not survive or integrate properly into the heart, and few stem cells can be coaxed into becoming heart cells. An alternative approach pioneered by Deepak Srivastava, MD, director of cardiovascular and stem cell research at Gladstone, used genes to convert scar-forming cells in the heart of animals into new muscle that improved the function of the heart. A chemical reprogramming approach to do the same may offer an easier way to provide the cues that induce heart muscle to regenerate locally.  In the Science study, led by first author Nan Cao, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Ding's lab, the researchers used a cocktail of nine chemicals to change human skin cells into beating heart cells. By trial and error, they found the best combination of chemicals to begin the process by changing the cells into a state resembling multipotent stem cells, which can turn into many different types of cells in a particular organ. A second cocktail of chemicals and growth factors helped transition the cells to become heart muscle cells.  With this method, more than 97% of the cells began beating, a characteristic of fully developed, healthy heart cells. The cells also responded appropriately to hormones, and molecularly, they resembled heart muscle cells, not skin cells. What s more, when the cells were transplanted into a mouse heart early in the process, they developed into healthy-looking heart muscle cells within the organ.  The ultimate goal in treating heart failure is a robust, reliable way for the heart to create new muscle cells,  said Srivastava, co-senior author on the Science paper.  Reprogramming a patient s own cells could provide the safest and most efficient way to regenerate dying or diseased heart muscle.  Rejuvenating the Brain with Neural Stem Cells In the second study, authored by Gladstone postdoctoral scholar Mingliang Zhang, PhD, and published in Cell Stem Cell, the scientists created neural stem cells from mouse skin cells using a similar approach. The chemical cocktail again consisted of nine molecules, some of which overlapped with those used in the first study. Over ten days, the cocktail changed the identity of the cells, until all of the skin cell genes were turned off and the neural stem cell genes were gradually turned on. When transplanted into mice, the neural stem cells spontaneously developed into the three basic types of brain cells: neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. The neural stem cells were also able to self-replicate, making them ideal for treating neurodegenerative diseases or brain injury.  With their improved safety, these neural stem cells could one day be used for cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease,  said co-senior author Yadong Huang, MD, PhD, a senior investigator at Gladstone.  In the future, we could even imagine treating patients with a drug cocktail that acts on the brain or spinal cord, rejuvenating cells in the brain in real time. ","Published: May 3, 2016"

The Monash team led by Associate Professor Sureshkumar Balasubramanian made the discovery by applying a combination of genetic, molecular and computational biology experiments to the flowering plant Arabidopsis. Associate Professor Balasubramanian explained how two key basic cellular processes work together to reduce the levels of a protein that normally prevents flowering, allowing the plants to produce flowers in response to elevated temperature.  This is very exciting as our understanding of how these genetic mechanisms work together opens up whole new possibilities for us to be able to develop technology to control when plants flower under different temperatures. These mechanisms are present in all organisms, so we may be able to transfer this knowledge to crop plants, with very promising possibilities for agriculture,  Associate Professor Balasubramanian said. While Associate Professor Balasubramanian discovered the genetic basis of temperature-induced flowering ten years ago, only now, with the availability of new computational approaches, were the researchers able to discover this mechanism.  It will be interesting to investigate whether similar mechanisms operate in the control of other genes in response to environmental changes,  said ARC Post-doctoral researcher Sridevi Sureshkumar, the paper s first author.","Published: May 3, 2016"

Professors Derek Wilson (Chemistry), Sergey Krylov (Chemistry) and Chun Peng (Biology) have the bioanalytical and research expertise and together with Sanofi-Pasteur, Sciex, and Fluidigm Canada, they are launching the  Technology- Enhanced Biopharmaceuticals Development and Manufacturing  project, which will aim to improve tests for early-stage candidate drugs.  We will develop a platform to rapidly determine detailed information about biologic drug candidates, including the nature of these molecules and specifically how they interact with their targets,  explains Derek Wilson, director of the Centre for Research in Mass Spectrometry and lead of the project.  Creating such a platform will allow pharmaceutical companies to greatly accelerate and improve the quality of their drug discovery and development processes, making it easier to bring much needed drugs to market.  Wilson, Krylov and Peng are experts in the techniques required to carry out this project. The mass spectrometry and electrophoresis technologies that will provide the unique analytical backbone for the platform are products of Wilson s and Krylov s research programs. Peng will contribute her unique expertise in microRNAs to sub-projects related to vaccine development. From the industry perspective, Sanofi will share its drug development systems, Sciex will contribute its world-leading mass spectrometry instruments, and Fluidigm will offer their unique CyTOF technology.  The project will enhance York s research profile in biopharmaceuticals development and manufacturing and provide an exceptional, industry-linked training environment for graduate students and post-docs,  said Robert Hach , York s vice-president research & innovation.  In addition, the technology and training that will emerge from this collaboration will meet the needs of the growing Canadian biopharmaceuticals industry.  Biopharmaceuticals are drugs manufactured from biological sources and now represent the fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry. But there is a major bottleneck in their development. Due to technological limitations and the molecular complexity of biopharmaceuticals, important details such as what a drug-target complex looks like are usually not available. This makes it difficult for companies to decide whether or not to pursue further testing of candidate drugs and it slows down drug development.","Published: May 3, 2016"

Studying preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at St. Louis Children s Hospital, the researchers found that preemies whose daily diets were at least 50 percent breast milk had more brain tissue and cortical-surface area by their due dates than premature babies who consumed significantly less breast milk. See Also: Subtle but important memory function affected by preterm birth The researchers, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, present their findings May 3 at the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies, in Baltimore.  The brains of babies born before their due dates usually are not fully developed,  said senior investigator Cynthia Rogers, MD, an assistant professor of child psychiatry who treats patients at St. Louis Children s Hospital.  But breast milk has been shown to be helpful in other areas of development, so we looked to see what effect it might have on the brain. With MRI scans, we found that babies fed more breast milk had larger brain volumes. This is important because several other studies have shown a correlation between brain volume and cognitive development.  The study included 77 preterm infants. The researchers retrospectively looked to see how much breast milk those babies had received while being cared for in the NICU. Then, the researchers conducted brain scans on those infants at about the time each would have been born had the babies not arrived early. All of the babies were born at least 10 weeks early, with an average gestation of 26 weeks, or about 14 weeks premature. Because they are still developing, preemies typically have smaller brains than full-term infants. Depictions of the cortical-surface area of the brain at different points in gestation. Illustration credit: Eric Young  First author Erin Reynolds, a research technician in Rogers  laboratory, said in gauging the effects of breast milk on the babies  brains, the researchers didn t distinguish between milk that came from the babies  own mothers and breast milk donated by other women. Rather, they focused on the influence of breast milk in general. Learn More: Antidepressants during pregnancy linked to preterm birth  As the amount of breast milk increased, so did a baby s chances of having a larger cortical surface area,  Reynolds said.  The cortex is the part of the brain associated with cognition, so we assume that more cortex will help improve cognition as the babies grow and develop.  Preterm birth is a leading cause of neurologic problems in children and has been linked to psychiatric disorders later in childhood. Rogers and her team plan to follow the babies in the study through their first several years of life to see how they grow, focusing on their motor, cognitive and social development. As the babies get older, the researchers believe they will be able to determine the effects of early exposure to breast milk on later developmental outcomes.  We want to see whether this difference in brain size has an effect on any of those developmental milestones,  Rogers said.  Neonatologists already believe breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm infants. We wanted to see whether it was possible to detect the impact of breast milk on the brain this early in life and whether the benefits appeared quickly or developed over time.

Sheryl Smith, PhD, professor of physiology and pharmacology at SUNY Downstate, explained, ""Memories are formed at structures in the brain known as dendritic spines that communicate with other brain cells through synapses. The number of brain connections decreases by half after puberty, a finding shown in many brain areas and for many species, including humans and rodents."" See Also: Children with autism have extra synapses in brain This process is referred to as adolescent ""synaptic pruning"" and is thought to be important for normal learning in adulthood. Synaptic pruning is believed to remove unnecessary synaptic connections to make room for relevant new memories, but because it is disrupted in diseases such as autism and schizophrenia, there has recently been widespread interest in the subject. Dr. Smith continued, ""Our report is the first to identify the process which initiates synaptic pruning at puberty. Previous studies have shown that scavenging by the immune system cleans up the debris from these pruned connections, likely the final step in the pruning process. ""Working with a mouse model we have shown that, at puberty, there is an increase in inhibitory GABA receptors, which are targets for brain chemicals that quiet down nerve cells. We now report that these GABA receptors trigger synaptic pruning at puberty in the mouse hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory."" The report is published in eLife. Dr. Smith adds that by reducing brain activity, these GABA receptors also reduce levels of a protein in the dendritic spine, kalirin-7, which stabilizes the scaffolding in the spine to maintain its structure. Mice that do not have these receptors maintain the same high level of brain connections throughout adolescence. Learn More: New insights in pathological mechanism that causes dysfunctional synapses Dr. Smith points out that the mice with too many brain connections, which do not undergo synaptic pruning, are able to learn spatial locations, but are unable to re-learn new locations after the initial learning, suggesting that too many brain connections may limit learning potential. These findings may suggest new treatments targeting GABA receptors for ""normalizing"" synaptic pruning in diseases such as autism and schizophrenia, where synaptic pruning is abnormal. Research has suggested that children with autism may have an over-abundance of synapses in some parts of the brain. Other research suggests that prefrontal brain areas in persons with schizophrenia have fewer neural connections than the brains of those who do not have the condition.

The EUA authorizes qualified laboratories designated by Focus Diagnostics, Inc., and, in the United States, certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) to perform high complexity tests, to perform the Zika RT-PCR test. This test can potentially be performed at any CLIA high-complexity laboratory in the Quest Diagnostics network, which includes several dozen CLIA high-complexity labs in the United States, including in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. For now, only the company's Focus Diagnostics reference laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., which developed and validated the new test, will perform this test. International and U.S. health officials have confirmed Zika infection during pregnancy can cause fetal microcephaly and other birth defects, and warned that local outbreaks in the United States are possible. Symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). The CDC recommends RT-PCR testing during approximately the first seven days of symptoms onset for certain patients. A negative result does not preclude infection, and additional serological testing to evaluate the body's immune response to infection may be considered within 2-12 weeks after symptom onset. The CDC recommends testing for individuals with symptoms suggestive of Zika infection who have traveled within the last two weeks to an area with ongoing transmission; asymptomatic pregnant women with a history of residence in or travel to areas of active Zika infection; asymptomatic pregnant women whose male sexual partners have traveled to or lived in an area of active Zika infection; and infants born to mothers who live or traveled to areas with Zika virus transmission during their pregnancy, including both molecular and serologic testing of infants who are being evaluated for evidence of a congenital Zika virus infection. In addition, Quest Diagnostics plans to offer serological test services assuming FDA authorization of serological test kits for emergency use. The FDA EUA for the Zika RT-PCR test is the second EUA Focus Diagnostics has received for an emerging infectious disease diagnostic test. In 2009, the company was granted the first EUA for a commercial lab test for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic virus. Focus Diagnostics, Inc., includes reference laboratory and product manufacturing businesses. Quest expects to complete the sale of the product manufacturing business to Diasorin in the second quarter of 2016, but will continue to wholly own the Focus reference laboratory business that developed the Zika RT-PCR test as well as intellectual property related to the test.","Published: April 30, 2016"

The laboratory of Dr. Robert Amato is utilizing Fluxion s IsoFlux System to isolate, recover, and analyze rare circulating cancer cells (CTCs) at the molecular level. Ongoing access to cancer tissue represents one of the most significant challenges in characterizing cancer, and CTCs can alleviate this limitation by providing frequent, minimally-invasive access to cancer tissue via a blood draw. The high efficiency and high purity of CTCs recovered with IsoFlux system allows for the use of highly multiplexed analyses such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) for cancer mutational profiling. This  liquid biopsy  approach allows screening for a broad range of cancer biomarkers that will help guide treatment decisions using an emerging class of precision cancer therapies. The collaboration with Dr. Amato will initially focus on prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers. One of the world s leading experts in the treatment of genitourinary cancer, Dr. Amato, full professor and Director of the Division of Oncology at UT Health Medical School and the Chief of the Division of Oncology at the Memorial Hermann Cancer Center, stated.  We have already shown the ability to detect cancer in its early stages, and to measure tumor heterogeneity through single-cell analysis. The use of intact, live cells also offers the ability to measure gene and protein expression, and directly enables the use of mouse models for pharmacodynamic testing. Cancer is a dynamic disease, and the ability to track changes in each patient via a blood sample can allow actionable changes to be detected much earlier. One aim of the collaboration is to identify markers that can help stratify patients requiring more aggressive treatment from those that don t.

But exactly how that acidity affects brain function isn't well understood. In a paper published in Scientific Reports, University at Buffalo (UB) researchers have begun to unravel some of the puzzle. They found that an elusive brain receptor may play an important role in the death of neurons from neurological diseases. The UB researchers study a family of brain receptors that are critical to learning and memory, called NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. They found that one of these receptors called N3A functions through a different mechanism than all other NMDA receptors. See Also: Unprecedented 3-D view of important brain receptor ""We found that in contrast to all other NMDA receptors, acidity can reactivate dormant N3A receptors,"" said Gabriela K. Popescu, PhD, senior author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. ""This insight led us to hypothesize that N3A receptors are silent in normal conditions, which may explain why other researchers have failed to observe them previously."" Popescu and Kirstie A. Cummings, lead author and doctoral candidate in the UB Department of Biochemistry, found that when the N3A receptors were exposed to acidic conditions, as occurs in brain disorders such as stroke or epilepsy, they reactivate, causing neurons to become more sensitive to the neurotransmitter glutamate, which can, under certain circumstances, kill them. The research was done in cell culture with recombinant receptors. ""Given that acidity increases after a stroke or an epileptic seizure, reactivation of N3A receptors may be one reason why neurons die after these neurologic events,"" said Popescu. ""So finding ways to prevent acidification or the reactivation of N3A receptors may prevent brain damage from strokes or seizures, for example."" She added that N3A proteins appear to be more abundant in brains of people with schizophrenia. ""This is in line with our findings, since schizophrenia, a disease associated with high acidity in the brain, causes brains to shrink,"" she said. Popescu noted that the finding also sheds much needed light on the N3A receptors. ""Since their discovery more than 20 years ago, attempts to understand the roles of N3A receptors in the brain have been unsuccessful,"" she said. ""Because many labs have failed to record N3A activity from neurons, some researchers even began to doubt their relevance to brain activity."" Learn More: Detail of intact neuronal receptor offers blueprint for drug developers The new paper reveals that electrical currents passed by N3A receptors can excite cells in response to acidity, which makes them different from all other NMDA receptors. The researchers have identified the site on the receptor where acidity acts to reactivate these receptors, a different location from the site where acidity acts to inhibit all other NMDA receptors. ""This site is new and unique and thus can be used to make drugs that are very specific to the N3A receptor,"" said Popescu.

Scientists at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, have taken a step in that direction by building a ""semantic atlas"" that shows in vivid colors and multiple dimensions how the human brain organizes language. The atlas identifies brain areas that respond to words that have similar meanings. See Also: First language wires brain for later language-learning The findings, published in the journal Nature and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), are based on a brain imaging study that recorded neural activity while study volunteers listened to stories from ""The Moth Radio Hour."" They show that at least 1/3 of the brain's cerebral cortex including areas dedicated to high-level cognition is involved in language processing. Notably, the study found that different people share similar language maps. ""The similarity in semantic topography across different subjects is really surprising,"" said study lead author Alex Huth, a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at UC Berkeley. Detailed maps showing how the brain organizes different words by their meanings could eventually help give voice to those who cannot speak, such as people who have had a stroke, brain damage or motor neuron diseases such as ALS. While mind-reading technology remains far off on the horizon, charting language organization in the brain brings decoding inner dialogue a step closer to reality, the researchers said. ""This discovery paves the way for brain-machine interfaces that can interpret the meaning of what people want to express,"" Huth said. ""Imagine a brain-machine interface that doesn't just figure out what sounds you want to make, but what you want to say."" For example, clinicians could track the brain activity of patients who have difficulty communicating and then match that data to semantic language maps to determine what their patients are trying to express. Another potential application is a decoder that translates what you say into another language as you speak. Learn More: A dominant hemisphere for handedness and language? ""To be able to map out semantic representations at this level of detail is a stunning accomplishment,"" said Kenneth Whang, a program director in the NSF Information and Intelligent Systems division. ""In addition, they are showing how data-driven computational methods can help us understand the brain at the level of richness and complexity that we associate with human cognitive processes."" Huth and six other native English speakers participated in the experiment, which required volunteers to remain still inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner for hours at a time. Each study participant's brain blood flow was measured as they listened, with eyes closed and headphones on, to more than two hours of stories from The Moth Radio Hour, a public radio show in which people recount humorous and poignant autobiographical experiences. The participants' brain imaging data were then matched against time-coded, phonemic transcriptions of the stories. Phonemes are units of sound that distinguish one word from another. The researchers then fed that information into a word-embedding algorithm that scored words according to how closely they are related semantically. The results were converted into a thesaurus-like map that arranged words on images of the flattened cortices of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Words were grouped under various headings: visual, tactile, numeric, locational, abstract, temporal, professional, violent, communal, mental, emotional and social. Not surprisingly, the maps show that many areas of the human brain represent language that describes people and social relations, rather than abstract concepts. Don't Miss: Brain responses to speech predict early language outcomes in children with autism ""Our semantic models are good at predicting responses to language in several big swaths of cortex,"" Huth said.

Senior author Jack Gallant, a UC Berkeley neuroscientist, said that although the maps are broadly consistent across individuals, ""There are also substantial individual differences.

Using an incision originally designed for another purpose, surgeons can gain direct access to the nerves involved in some types of chronic temporal headache, according to the report by Dr. Ziv M. Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will ""lower the bar to adoption"" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition. See Also: Summer season springs cluster headaches into action In recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address ""trigger sites"" linked to certain headache patterns. Severe temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches. The technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients. Learn More: Severe headache in pregnant women: When to worry All patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI). As in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms. It's unclear why the three remaining patients didn't have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring. Don't Miss: Beware, asthma sufferers: Migraines may worsen Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected.

The level of salts in the brain plays a critical role in whether we are asleep or awake. This discovery may be of great importance to research on psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and convulsive fits from lack of sleep as well as post-anaesthetization confusion, according to Professor Maiken Nedergaard. Salts in our brain decide whether we are asleep or awake. For the first time, researchers have shown that the level of salts in our body and brain differ depending on whether we are asleep or awake. A new study from the University of Copenhagen reveals that by influencing the level of salts, it is possible to control a mouse's sleep-wake cycle. The research is published in the journal Science. See Also: Weekend catch-up sleep can reduce diabetes risk associated with sleep loss ""These salts play a much larger and much more decisive role than hitherto imagined. The discovery reveals a completely new layer of understanding of how the brain functions. First and foremost, we learn more about how sleep is controlled. It may, however, also open up for a better future understanding of why some people suffer convulsive fits when staying awake all through the night,"" says Professor Maiken Nedergaard from the Center for Basic and Translational Neuroscience at the University of Copenhagen. The researchers have used mice to test whether injecting salt into the brain enables control of the mouse's sleep-wake cycle independently of the so-called neuromodulators. Neuromodulators are compounds such as for example, adrenalin, which plays a decisive role in our waking up every morning. The study shows that adrenalin and other neuromodulators change the level of salts surrounding the neurons and that the salt balance then decides whether the neurons are sensitive to stimulation in the shape of a touch. When we are awake, the salt balance makes neurons highly sensitive to stimulation, as opposed to the salt balance in the brain during sleep, where the level of salts makes it harder to activate the neurons. Don't Miss: Brain damage caused by severe sleep apnea is reversible ""It's much simpler than previously believed in brain research. The research conducted used to focus only on the brain's neural activity as a means of mapping and analysing complicated processes such as being asleep or awake. Our study shows that the brain uses something as simple as changing the level of salts to control whether we are asleep or awake. This discovery reveals that studying only neurons in order to understand brain activity is not enough. We must include all the supportive cells, especially the so-called astrocytes, which regulate the level of salts in the brain. The brain is more than a group of neurons that function like a computer. The fact that the brain needs 7-8 hours of sleep to function well on a daily basis reveals that there's much more we need to understand, aside from neurocomputation,"" Professor Maiken Nedergaard concludes.

Cases associated with changes in each of the four genes were different from each other in terms of symptoms, intelligence level and other disease features. Unlike ""big data"" genetic studies, which have loosely linked hundreds of genetic changes to schizophrenia but cannot explain varying symptoms, the new study revealed distinct disease versions that may affect large slices of patients and enable precision treatment design, say the authors. See Also: Schizophrenia's strongest known genetic risk deconstructed ""A common fallacy is that schizophrenia can be treated as a single disease,"" says NYU Langone psychiatrist and lead study author Dolores Malaspina, MD. ""Our biologically driven study begins to answer longstanding questions in the field about why any two people diagnosed with schizophrenia may have drastically different symptoms. For the first time, we have defined four syndromes mechanistically. ""Perhaps as many as 30 percent of schizophrenic patients may now become candidates for more precise treatment based on the individual characteristics of these four genes, with the remaining cases becoming less mysterious as we pull these groups out of the mix,"" says Malaspina, the Anita Steckler and Joseph Steckler Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone. ""Our approach provides a new framework for finding influential genes across complex genetic diseases associated with paternal age, from schizophrenia to autism."" Patients with schizophrenia struggle to interpret reality, typically suffering from hallucinations, learning disabilities, emotional withdrawal and lack of motivation. In the current study, researchers analyzed 48 ethnically diverse patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, looking at symptom sets in patients found to have rare or previously unknown changes in the DNA code of the four genes that disrupted brain function. Don't Miss: Retinal changes may serve as measures of brain pathology in schizophrenia The four influential genes now tied by the study to specific conditions are all involved in the growth or regulation of nerve circuits. They included PTPRG, which encodes a protein that enables nerve cells to connect as they form nerve networks. Patients with rare changes in this gene experienced earlier onset of relatively severe psychosis, and had a history of learning disabilities. Despite the high intelligence in some, they showed cognitive deficits in working memory, the ""scratchpad"" where the brain stores and processes temporary memories. A second key gene, SLC39SA13, codes for a zinc transporter that helps nerve cells to ""decide"" whether or not nerve impulses are amplified of dampened. These cases showed widespread cognitive deficits, low educational attainment and the most severe deficits in emotion and motivation. A third influential gene was ARMS/KIDINS220, which codes for a protein that regulates the growth of nerve cells. Patients who had changed versions of this gene showed early promise, often attending college, but then experienced cognitive decline consistent with a degenerative disease. The last gene of interest was TGM5, which encodes a protein that stabilizes protein groups. Related proteins have been linked to age-related degenerative conditions like Huntington's disease. TGM5 cases had less severe symptoms, but were more often diagnosed with attention deficit disorder during childhood. ""Our results argue that new treatments should while addressing core psychoses also focus on processing speed in TGM5 cases, working memory in PTPRG, zinc augmentation in SLC39A13, and nerve cell protection in patients with ARMS/KIDINS220 mutations,"" says first study author Thorsten Kranz, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of NYU Langone neuroscientist Moses Chao, PhD. ""Treatments that do not work for all patients may be highly effective in some."" A study published last year by the same team lay the foundation for the current EBioMedicine publication by defining the framework for finding influential genes. This study examined the genetic code of affected patients with schizophrenia and their healthy parents to identify newly occurring (sporadic) mutations that disrupted the four influential signaling genes in 31 percent of these patients. Related: Rare genetic mutations occur more often in schizophrenia patients, researchers find In general, more than 70 percent of schizophrenia cases are sporadic versus familial so many patients have variants of influential genes that have occurred in them for the first time. Malaspina's team was the first to show in a 2001 paper that the most important source of these rare, sporadic changes was the paternal germline (father's sperm), with advanced paternal age explaining over a quarter of the population risk for schizophrenia in an Israeli cohort. Sperm cells divide and multiply 600 times by the time a father reaches age 50. DNA is copied with each round of cell divisions, and copy errors accumulate as a father ages. ""Our combined findings to date argue that newly occurring mutations introduced via the father's germline in sporadic cases, when compared to healthy parents, represent a powerful tool for defining precise versions of schizophrenia,"" says Malaspina.

The innovative technology revealed that astrocytes cells in the nervous system that do not conduct electrical signals and were traditionally viewed as merely supportive unexpectedly react to intense sensation. The new miniaturized microscope and related imaging methods, described by Salk Institute scientists in Nature Communications, offer unprecedented insight into nervous system function and could lead to novel pain treatments for spinal cord injuries, chronic itch and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). See Also: First look at how astrocytes function in humans The spinal cord is crucial for sensing and responding to the world. Sometimes it even works independently from the brain, such as when your hand recoils from a hot stove before the sensation has fully registered. But it is unknown exactly how the cells within the spinal cord encode these and other feelings from the skin or internal organs. Salk researchers (Kohei Sekiguchi, left, and Axel Nimmerjahn) reveal the world's first imaging data on spinal cellular activity during behavior, enabled by their innovative miniaturized microscopes. Credit: Salk Institute  In the new study, senior author Axel Nimmerjahn, an assistant professor in Salk's Waitt Advanced Biophotonics Center, and his team improved upon the miniaturized microscopes they first described back in 2008. The researchers' new version which features numerous hardware and software improvements enabled them to visualize changes in cellular activity in awake, roaming mice. ""For a long time, researchers have dreamed of being able to record cellular activity patterns in the spinal cord of an awake animal. On top of that, we can now do this in a freely behaving animal, which is very exciting,"" says first author Kohei Sekiguchi, a Salk researcher and PhD student at the University of California, San Diego. Most of the Salk team's previous work focused on deploying microscopes to observe the brains of living animals. The spinal cord, by contrast, presented a bigger challenge for several reasons. For example, unlike the brain, multiple, independently moving vertebrae surround the spinal cord. The spinal cord is also closer to pulsating organs (heart and lungs), which can hinder stable views of the cells within. However, by developing new microscopy and procedural and computational approaches, the team was able to overcome these challenges and capture the action of living cells in real time and during vigorous movements. In the new work, the group found that distinct stimuli such as light touch or pressure activate different subsets of spinal sensory neurons. They also found that certain features, like the intensity or duration of a given stimulus, are reflected in the activity of the neurons. Learn More: Study shows astrocytes hold keys to brain organization and disease To the team's surprise, astrocytes, traditionally thought to be passive support cells, also respond to stimuli (albeit differently than the neurons). Though the astrocytes cannot send electrical signals like neurons can, they generated their own chemical signals in a coordinated way during intense stimuli. Nimmerjahn is excited about this result because his group has a longstanding interest in understanding astrocytes and their roles in nervous system function and disease. These cells are increasingly appreciated as important players in how the nervous system develops and operates and could serve as promising new drug targets, he says. ""Not only can we now study normal sensory processing, but we can also look at disease contexts like spinal cord injury and how treatments actually affect the cells,"" says Nimmerjahn. The team is now working to simultaneously record touch or pain-related activity in the brain and spinal cord using additional iterations of the miniaturized microscopes, which allow them to monitor and manipulate multiple cell types at even higher resolutions.

Three Rice computational and applied mathematics students are refining a program to analyze magnetic relaxometry signals from iron-oxide nanoparticles that find and attach themselves to cancerous cells. Rice seniors Brian Ho, Rachel Hoffman and Eric Sung have developed a novel way to analyze data for cancer researchers who hope to use magnetic nanoparticles to locate signs of cancer that X-rays would never spot. All magnets (or materials prone to magnetism) have magnetic  moments,  like invisible needles that can move and react to magnetic fields, even if their physical hosts can t. These ghostly needles align when exposed to an external magnetic field; when the field is removed, they  relax  once again. Relaxometry measures this latter characteristic. It turns out the moments relax at a very different rate when they belong to nanoparticles that are bound to cancer cells. The students are working with Rice adviser B atrice Rivi re, the Noah G. Harding Chair and a professor of computational and applied mathematics, and doctors at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to develop computer programs that analyze  traces  of these moments as they relax. Albuquerque, N.M.,-based Senior Scientific, in collaboration with MD Anderson, is developing a commercial relaxometry platform for the early detection of cancer. The 25-nanometer superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles are enhanced with antibody proteins that target biomarker proteins produced by cancer cells, Sung said.  Once they bind to the cells, their range of motion is severely restricted, and this restricted movement is pretty important,  he said.  Once you apply an external magnetic field, the particles  dipoles will align to counteract the field. Once the dipoles face each other, then you have a magnetic field of essentially zero. But the interesting part to us is what comes after.  The students and the MD Anderson team are working to quantify this relaxation phase because it marks the location of cancer cells in lab samples and in mice. Unbound nanoparticles will randomly reorient themselves in less than a millisecond, but because antibody-associated nanoparticle complexes that are bound to cancer cells are restricted in their movement, their magnetic relaxation is a lot slower   up to a second, Sung said.  We re figuring out exactly what that means.  he said. The team noted today s best cancer detection methods only catch tumors with more than 10 million cancer cells. The new approach has the potential to detect tumors with as few as 20,000 cells. The students expect methods that rely on relaxometry will also be safer than current methods that expose patients to ionizing radiation. The students  software addresses two problems that can corrupt relaxometry data. One is that physical motion   like a patient s breathing   can displace the target signal and skew the results.  The other is what the students call  flux jumps,  a recording artifact that causes a wholesale shift in the data.  The flux jump has to do with the way it s measured,  Sung said.  But we ve figured out an algorithm to take care of both these things. And it looks pretty nice.  Hoffman said the Rice team brought new perspective to the problem recognized by MD Anderson s David Fuentes, an assistant professor in the Department of Imaging Physics, and his colleagues.  They were looking at it very theoretically, whereas we look at it more pragmatically,  she said.  We researched what we can do with this particular data, as opposed to trying to develop an algorithm that could be applied to any data set.   Indeed, the senior design team s contribution to motion correction and flux-jump detection will have a lasting impact and will be incorporated into future analysis pipelines,  Fuentes said. Ho said the Rice team s next step is to create a way to generate synthetic data traces to test the program.  Once we re able to put in some flux jumps and breathing spikes, we can quantify how good our algorithm is,  he said.","Published: April 29, 2016"

Using engineered tissue environments in various shapes and patterns, the study of skin cancer found that the more curved the cell cultures were, the more cancer cells at the edges displayed markers of stem cell characteristics   the key to spreading to other tissues. This has potential for furthering our understanding of cancer as well as developing personalized treatment plans. Led by Kristopher Kilian, a professor of materials science and engineering, and Timothy Fan, a professor of veterinary medicine, the researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Materials.    The most dangerous part of cancer is metastasis,  Kilian said.  Some cells that we call cancer stem cells adopt deadly characteristics where they can travel through the bloodstream to other tissue and form new tumors. There s a need for ways to find these cells and to study them, and importantly, to develop drugs that target them, because these cancer stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy drugs that target the main tumor. This causes recurrence: The cancer comes back.  Kilian s group specializes in tissue engineering to create models of tumors, in order to more accurately study cancer processes in a culture dish. In the new study, the researchers cultured mouse skin-cancer colonies on various 2-D and 3-D environments of different shapes and patterns to see if the tumor shape contributes to activation of cancer stem cells, and to see where in the tumor the stem cells appeared. They found that cancer stem cells seemed to appear in the highest numbers along the edges of the engineered tumor environments, particularly where there were corners and convex curves.  It was actually quite surprising,  Kilian said.  Normal stem cells prefer a soft, squishy, internal position. So for cancer, everyone had assumed that the cancer stem cells were in the middle of the tumor. We found that geometric constraints, like you would have where a tumor touches healthy tissue, seem to activate these cancer stem cells at the perimeter.  The researchers did a number of tests in their engineered environments to confirm tumor-spreading ability, such as genetic analysis. They also tested other cancer lines   human cervical, lung and prostate cancers   and found that they responded to the patterned tumor environments in the same way. Then Kilian s group teamed with Fan s group to test the skin-cancer stem cells in live mice, and found that the cells taken from the patterned environments were much more likely to cause tumors than cells taken from a conventional flat dish.  We found that many more mice developed tumors when given the cells that we had engineered to have these stem cell characteristics, and they had a much higher incidence of metastasis in the lungs,  Kilian said.  In a tumor, similarly, regions that develop these kinds of shapes may activate cells that can then escape and form more tumors. This may allow surgeons to look at the perimeter of a growing tumor and use the shape to guide their assessment of which regions could be more problematic   where they need to take out more tissue around the tumor and where they may not need to take as much.  Kilian hopes that the patterned, engineered tissue environments will give researchers a new way to find and culture cancer stem cells, which have been very elusive in conventional cultures   less than 1 percent of cells, he said. Beyond the fundamental science of finding and understanding these cancer-spreading cells, he also sees engineered tumor environments as having therapeutic applications in personalized medicine.  You can imagine a patient has a particular tumor. You could engineer that in a dish, and using the patient s own cells, you could develop a model of their specific tumor to test out drugs,  he said.  If you could take a patient s cells and within days have microtumors that you could use to screen all the available drugs, then an oncologist would be able to prescribe a treatment that s tailor-made for the patient that targets both the tumor cells and these elusive cancer stem cells that currently we can t see.  There s a lot more work to be done, but we re very excited about how a very simple materials property of a growing tumor might be a culprit of the disease spreading. We think it opens up a new avenue of investigation for drug development, guiding surgery, and understanding progression and spreading of cancer,  Kilian said.  Cancer is very complex, so putting it in context is key. If there is a microenvironment that provides the context for activating cells that can spread cancer, then that s important to know.  The American Cancer Society and the National Science Foundation supported this work. Kilian is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, the department of bioengineering and the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory at Illinois.","Published: April 29, 2016"

All previous work on cellular reprogramming required adding external genes to the cells, making this accomplishment an unprecedented feat. The research lays the groundwork for one day being able to regenerate lost or damaged cells with pharmaceutical drugs. In two studies published in Science and Cell Stem Cell, the team of scientists, who were led by Gladstone senior investigator Sheng Ding, PhD, and are part of the Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone, used chemical cocktails to gradually coax skin cells to change into organ-specific stem cell-like cells and, ultimately, into heart or brain cells. This discovery offers a more efficient and reliable method to reprogram cells and avoids medical concerns surrounding genetic engineering.  This method brings us closer to being able to generate new cells at the site of injury in patients,  said Ding, the senior author on both studies.  Our hope is to one day treat diseases like heart failure or Parkinson s disease with drugs that help the heart and brain regenerate damaged areas from their own existing tissue cells. This process is much closer to the natural regeneration that happens in animals like newts and salamanders, which has long fascinated us.  Chemically Repaired Hearts Adult hearts have a very limited ability to generate new cells, so scientists have searched for a way to replace cells lost after a heart attack, such as transplanting adult heart cells or stem cells into the damaged heart. However, these efforts have been largely ineffective, as most transplanted adult cells do not survive or integrate properly into the heart, and few stem cells can be coaxed into becoming heart cells. An alternative approach pioneered by Deepak Srivastava, MD, director of cardiovascular and stem cell research at Gladstone, used genes to convert scar-forming cells in the heart of animals into new muscle that improved the function of the heart. A chemical reprogramming approach to do the same may offer an easier way to provide the cues that induce heart muscle to regenerate locally.  In the Science study, led by first author Nan Cao, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Ding's lab, the researchers used a cocktail of nine chemicals to change human skin cells into beating heart cells. By trial and error, they found the best combination of chemicals to begin the process by changing the cells into a state resembling multipotent stem cells, which can turn into many different types of cells in a particular organ. A second cocktail of chemicals and growth factors helped transition the cells to become heart muscle cells.  With this method, more than 97% of the cells began beating, a characteristic of fully developed, healthy heart cells. The cells also responded appropriately to hormones, and molecularly, they resembled heart muscle cells, not skin cells. What s more, when the cells were transplanted into a mouse heart early in the process, they developed into healthy-looking heart muscle cells within the organ.  The ultimate goal in treating heart failure is a robust, reliable way for the heart to create new muscle cells,  said Srivastava, co-senior author on the Science paper.  Reprogramming a patient s own cells could provide the safest and most efficient way to regenerate dying or diseased heart muscle.  Rejuvenating the Brain with Neural Stem Cells In the second study, authored by Gladstone postdoctoral scholar Mingliang Zhang, PhD, and published in Cell Stem Cell, the scientists created neural stem cells from mouse skin cells using a similar approach. The chemical cocktail again consisted of nine molecules, some of which overlapped with those used in the first study. Over ten days, the cocktail changed the identity of the cells, until all of the skin cell genes were turned off and the neural stem cell genes were gradually turned on. When transplanted into mice, the neural stem cells spontaneously developed into the three basic types of brain cells: neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. The neural stem cells were also able to self-replicate, making them ideal for treating neurodegenerative diseases or brain injury.  With their improved safety, these neural stem cells could one day be used for cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease,  said co-senior author Yadong Huang, MD, PhD, a senior investigator at Gladstone.  In the future, we could even imagine treating patients with a drug cocktail that acts on the brain or spinal cord, rejuvenating cells in the brain in real time. ","Published: April 29, 2016"

University of Bonn researchers have discovered a new method to measure the activity of brown fat cells in humans and mice. The researchers showed that microRNA-92a can be used as an indirect measure for the activity of energy consuming brown fat cells. They showed that a small blood sample was sufficient.  People who want to lose weight often encounter boundaries: No matter what diet they try, the pounds won t drop. Being overweight and obese can have severe health consequences, and has shown to increase a person s chance of developing type-2-diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. Prof. Dr. Alexander Pfeifer, head of the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology of the University Bonn, has been investigating brown fat in mice for years. He has been trying to understand how to turn unfavored white fat cells into energy-consuming brown ones. Brown fat cells can  burn  excessive energy by producing heat instead of storing fat. Prof. Pfeifer s team has discovered multiple signaling cascades and possible drug targets in rodents that are responsible for the conversion from white-energy-storing to brown-energy-consuming fat cells. However, for these basic research findings to become human treatment, clinical trials are needed to discover which drug is most efficient in activating brown fat and has few or no side effects. These clinical trials are hampered because so far no method is on the market to measure the brown fat activity without health risk and expensive equipment. Brown fat cells release miR-92a into the circulation In collaboration with the University Maastricht (Netherlands), Turku (Finland) and the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, researchers in Prof. Pfeifer s group found an easy way to display brown fat activity: miR-92a. miRNAs are known to be responsible for the regulation of genes. The researchers showed for the first time that brown fat cells deliver these microRNAs into the blood by packaging into so-called exosomes, which  can be seen as little packages that are delivered by the brown fat cells through the circulation.  However, Prof. Pfeiffer said,  to whom the packages are delivered is yet unknown.  Many miRNAs were investigated during the investigation. miR-92a is present in human and mice   importantly   this microRNA is related to brown fat activity. Whenever miR-92a is low in circulation, people can burn a lot of energy with brown fat. To prove the connection in humans, scientists tested 41 participants from Finland and the Netherlands.  We found a significant relation between brown fat activity and miR-92a that needs to be proven in larger cohorts,  said co-first author Joschka Johannes Buyel, a PhD student in Prof. Pfeifer s lab. Measuring miR-92a would allow for a much more accurate measure of the brown fat activity. Biomarker might enable for efficacy testing of new pharmaceuticals  miR-92a seems to be a promising biomarker to test new drugs in the field of weight reduction or transition from white-to-brown fat in humans; this promising biomarker should be tested in larger cohorts  said Prof. Pfeifer. This new method might enable advances in obesity research and related fields.","Published: April 29, 2016"

The research showed that the sensitivity of the HPV test on first-void urine was similar to the sensitivity of the HPV test on a pap smear and a self-collected cervico-vaginal sample. The HPV types found in the three types of samples were highly similar. The results of the study was presented last week at the ECCMID 2016 Congress (European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases) in Amsterdam. Participation rates of women in cervical cancer screening could be increased by offering home-based self-sampling. Currently 1 in 4 women in Belgium and the Netherlands are not taking part in the screening programs. The recent results of Novosanis and DDL Diagnostic Laboratory show a similar sensitivity of the HPV test of a home-collected first-void urine sample using the Colli-Pee device, a pap smear taken by a healthcare worker and a self-collected cervico-vaginal sample. In the tested population, all serious precursor stages of cervical cancer (CIN3+ lesions) were detected in all three types of samples using an HPV test. There was no difference between the first-void urine samples taken in the morning and those taken later during the day. Annemiek Leeman, DDL Diagnostic Laboratory, commented:  HPV detection in morning and afternoon first-void urine samples seems feasible. Women were included in the Novosanis-DDL study upon an abnormal cervical swab. Sensitivity of the detection of HPV in women with pre-cancerous lesions who need follow-up proves to be similar to a physician-taken smear and to a brush-based self-collected sample. The use of Colli-Pee makes it easy to collect the relevant standardized first-void urine with urine preservative.   These first results are very important to Novosanis, since they show that an HPV test on a standardized first-void urine sample provides the same results as a pap smear taken by the healthcare worker. We hope to reach the women who are currently not participating in the screening programs by offering a non-invasive self-sampler.  says Vanessa Vankerckhoven, CEO Novosanis.","Published: April 29, 2016"

Scientists have long believed that inhaling toxic gases and particles from tobacco smoke causes inflammation of the small airways in the lungs, leading to the development of COPD. However, the theory doesn t explain why airway inflammation and disease progression continue even after the patient stops smoking. Now, a study led by Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) investigators finds that persistent inflammation in COPD may result from a defect in the immune system that allows airway bacteria to invade deeper into the lung. The research led by first author Bradley Richmond, M.D., instructor in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care, and senior authors Timothy Blackwell, M.D., and Vasiliy Polosukhin, M.D., Ph.D., was published online April 5 in Nature Communications. The investigators were interested in the function of the body s mucus membranes like those found in the nose and the lining of the lungs. Mucosal surfaces normally have an elaborate barrier that prevents bacteria from invading into deeper tissues. Having previously shown that patients with COPD often lack a key component of this barrier, called secretory immunoglobulin A (secretory IgA), the investigators studied mice lacking secretory IgA. While these mice appeared healthy at birth, as they aged they developed increased bacterial invasion, chronic inflammation and damage in the lungs similar to patients with COPD. These changes occurred without cigarette smoke or other exposures.  These findings suggest that, over time, changes in the airways resulting from cigarette smoke exposure make the lungs more susceptible to bacterial invasion. This may explain why inflammation persists in COPD even after patients stop smoking,  said Richmond. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug roflumilast halted lung damage in secretory IgA-deficient mice, suggesting a possible future therapy for patients with COPD and decreased secretory IgA in small airways.","Published: April 29, 2016"

The human genome contains about 20,000 protein-coding genes   less than 2 percent of the total   but 70 percent of the genome is made into non-gene-encoding RNA. Take triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype with poor clinical outcome, for example. Genomic studies of TNBC to solve for its tough-to-treat status have mainly focused on protein-coding genes and the function of non-coding genes is still largely unknown. Using a clinically guided genetic screening approach, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania identified LINP1, a lncRNA. This lncRNA is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer cells and regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and the activated cell surface protein, EGFR. LINP1 enhances the repair of DNA breaks by serving as a scaffold that links two other proteins in the repair machinery.   A BRCA1 mutation is associated with a higher risk for TNBC, which represents about 10 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases. TNBC test negative for both the estrogen and progesterone receptors and the cell surface receptor Her2, hence its name. Since hormones are not supporting growth, the cancer is unlikely to respond to hormonal therapies and medications that target HER2. Because of these limited therapeutic targets, many cancers, including TNBCs, are typically treated with surgery and a combination of radiation and chemotherapy that induce various types of DNA damage. However, many TNBC patients are resistant to these combination therapies. With support from the Basser Center for BRCA at Penn, the team was led by senior authors Lin Zhang, MD, the Harry Fields Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chi V. Dang, MD, PhD, director of the Abramson Cancer Center, and first author Youyou Zhang, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Obstetric and Gynecology. They published their findings this week in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. Recent studies, including publications from the Penn group, have identified lncRNAs with tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities in cancers. Building Bridges The two repair scaffold proteins, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs, that LINP1 links coordinate the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair molecules that fix double-strand breaks in DNA. Importantly, the team found that blocking LINP1 significantly increases sensitivity by the tumor cells to radiation therapy. The NHEJ pathway, which repairs double-strand breaks in DNA, is one of the major pathways in tumor cells that respond to radiation treatment and chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of the NHEJ pathway has been proposed by oncology researchers to synergize DNA-damaging therapies for better treatment outcomes for TNBCs.  Given the important role of LINP1 in the NHEJ pathway, our study indicates that this new class of cancer-driver gene -- the lncRNAs -- may serve as unique therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers in cancer,  Zhang said.  Collectively, our study provides new insight into the DNA damage repair pathway, long non-coding RNAs, and triple-negative breast cancer. ","Published: April 29, 2016"

Now, researchers are working to create ultrasensitive lab-on-a-chip devices to quickly measure glucose concentrations with the goal of developing device for early diagnosis and prevent of diabetes A team of researchers from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Zhejiang University in China report integrating fiber optic glucose sensors into a microfluidic chip to create portable, high-performance, low-cost devices for measuring glucose levels. In a paper published this week in the journal Biomedical Optics Express, from The Optical Society (OSA).  Today, photonic approaches are recognized as the most promising techniques for ultrasensitive sensing,  said Dr. A. Ping Zhang, associate professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  In particular, the synergistic integration of photonic sensing and microfluidics led to the state-of-the-art technology known as  optofluidics  for biological and chemical analysis.  One reason microfluidic chip technology is so appealing is that it provides a tiny platform to integrate sensors with functional components, such as microfluidic mixers, in order to achieve a lab-on-a-chip analysis system for fast and reliable results. While electrochemical glucose biosensors can be integrated into microfluidic channels to develop easy-to-handle, low-cost, and portable microfluidic chips, electroactive interference problems often appear in electrochemical sensors. But fiber optic sensors offer a solution to this issue, thanks to their immunity to electromagnetic interference. By combining a new fiber optic biosensor with a microfluidic chip, Zhang and colleagues created an interference-free optofluidic device for ultrasensitive detection of glucose levels. Their method involves  fabricating an optical fiber  long-period grating  (LPG) with a period of 390 microns within a small-diameter optical fiber with a cladding diameter of 80 microns,  he explained.  Such fiber optic devices induce strong co-directional mode coupling through a resonant scattering process. And the resulting central wavelength is very sensitive to changes of the refractive index (RI) of the surrounding media via the evanescent field of optical fiber cladding mode.  To transform the fiber optic RI sensor into a glucose sensor, the team selected glucose oxidase as a sensing material that would react with glucose in solution.  To support the sensing film and magnify RI change, a pH-responsive multilayer film of polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) is deposited on the side surface of the LPG sensor before immobilization of the sensing film,  Zhang noted. The PEI/PAA multilayer film  surveils the oxidation of glucose with the gluclose oxidase catalyst and responds to the reaction via swelling or contracting,  he added. Experimental results revealed that the new fiber optic sensor  is very sensitive on its own and can detect glucose oxidase concentrations as low as 1 nM (10-9molarity),  he said. But, after integration into the microfluidic chip, the sensor s performance was  remarkably further improved in terms of detection range and response time.  Also, notably,  no significant loss of biomolecular activity was observed during the experiments, which implies that our layer-by-layer self-assembly technique renders a robust electrostatic absorption of glucose oxidase within the sensing film,  Zhang said. The team s work  is a significant step toward developing optofluidic devices for the early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes,  he said. In terms of applications, the optofluidic device enables detection of glucose in solution   requiring only a tiny droplet of sweat.  This makes it an extremely appealing technology to develop for early diagnosis of diabetes via monitoring glucose content within sweat,  Zhang said. Their ultimate goal is to develop multifunctional  lab-on-a-chip  devices   through the integration of photonics, microfluidics, and functional materials onto a small chip.  Such a technology will enable a broad range of research and development in biomedical diagnostics, environmental monitoring and even aid drug discovery,  he noted.","Published: April 29, 2016"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-markers-influence-addiction-195782,Genetic Markers Influence Addiction Differences in vulnerability to cocaine addiction and relapse linked to both inherited traits and epigenetics  U M researchers find  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.Why does one person who tries cocaine get addicted, while another might use it and then leave it alone? Why do some people who kick a drug habit manage to stay clean, while others relapse? And why do some families seem more prone to addiction than others? The vulnerability of individuals to becoming ""hooked"" on drugs may involve specific genetic factors - both inherited and influenced by drug use. The road to answering these questions may have a lot to do with specific genetic factors that vary from individual to individual, a new study in rats suggests. Of course, an animal study can t explain all the factors that contribute to differences in addiction among humans. But the findings reveal new information about the roles played by both inherited traits and addiction-related changes in the brain. The study was just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a University of Michigan Medical School team. It s the first time scientists have shown in selectively bred animals that the propensity for addiction is linked to differences in expression of genes for specific molecules in a specific brain region. It s also the first demonstration that a DNA tag called an epigenetic marker can predispose an individual to addiction and relapse.   Pleasure receptor DNA differences The researchers looked in rats  brains for the genetic instructions needed to make a key  pleasure receptor , called D2, that allows brain cells to receive signals sent by the brain chemical dopamine   or cocaine. They found that more addiction-prone rats had lower levels of D2 instructions to begin with, compared with other rats, in an area of the brain known to play a major role in addiction. The addiction-prone rats also were more likely to carry a specific mark on their DNA called an epigenetic tag. This tag, called H3K9me3, kept their brain cells from reading the gene for D2 receptors. But after they became hooked on cocaine, the addiction-prone rats had the same levels of D2 as the less addiction-prone ones. And when the cocaine was taken away for a while, these rats were more likely to relapse to addictive behavior if they had started out with the epigenetic tag that kept their cells from reading the D2 gene. Meanwhile, a comparison group of rats didn t show signs of addiction, and didn t relapse following abstinence. The scientists found that these  addiction-resilient  rats started out with lower levels of instructions for making a different brain molecule also known to play a role in addiction, called FGF2. They were also more likely to carry an epigenetic mark that kept them from reading the FGF2 gene. And this might have helped protect them from becoming addicted.  Because we had access to these rats that were bred for certain traits, and were able to control for environmental factors, such as the amount of drug exposure, we could assess differences in the brain both before and after the rats became addicted,  says Shelly Flagel, Ph.D., lead author of the new study and an assistant professor of psychiatry at U-M.  By studying their gene expression and epigenetics, as well as their response to drug availability and drug-related cues, we can link these differences in the brain to addiction-like behaviors, such as relapse. This allows us to hone in on the biology of addiction even further.  And that kind of understanding could be a model to help the broader understanding of addiction in humans as well, Flagel says. The more that addiction is seen as having biological roots and origins in genetic traits that are inherited through families or amplified by drug taking, the better treatment options and public policy around drugs and drug users can be, she hopes. A tale of two rat breeds The findings come from studies of two special breeds of rats. Raised for dozens of generations in the lab of senior author Huda Akil, Ph.D., at the U-M Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute under carefully controlled conditions, the two breeds act as a way to study the effects of genetic and inherited traits on addiction-related behaviors. One breed, called bHR for bred high responders, tends to explore and seek novelty. The other, called bLR for bred low responders, does not. In fact, bLR rats often act anxious when presented with new situations, and prefer enclosed spaces even when they can see food in an open area. The two breeds allow scientists to study the impact of drug use and addiction on gene expression and epigenetics in the nucleus accumbens   the brain s  pleasure center , where response to drugs like cocaine occurs. Normally, the dopamine system in this area responds to naturally pleasant experiences and prompts us to pursue them again. It s as if the drug hijacks the system that fuels normal enjoyment or reward. And that can make the usual goal-driven motivated behavior that s driven by pleasure go awry. In the new study, the scientists first trained all the rats to expect to find cocaine in certain places, to poke their nose into a hole to get a controlled dose of it, and to expect it would be available when a certain light was shining. Even the anxious, timid bLR rats learned to take the drug. Although both groups of rats took the same amount of drug, the two breeds differed dramatically in how likely they were to seek out cocaine repeatedly. The bHR rats were much more likely to keep seeking cocaine, even when it was not available.   After a week without cocaine, bHR rats were more likely to  relapse  after getting an injection of cocaine. After a month with no cocaine, bHRs were much more likely than bLRs to start seeking it again when the light previously associated with cocaine delivery started coming on again. This is similar to what humans recovering from addiction often report: their craving for drugs returns when they see drug paraphernalia or return to a place where they once got or took drugs.  It is likely that the propensity to seek drugs and become addicted to them involves numerous genes. Moreover, factors beyond novelty-seeking including stress and depression can lead to substance use in some individuals,  says Akil. She, Flagel and their colleagues are now using broad-based genotyping to uncover other genes that contribute to various facets of drug abuse and addiction. These genetic findings will point to potential biomarkers and more targeted treatment strategies for substance use disorders.","Published: April 29, 2016"

But Northwestern Medicine scientists have solved that challenge by creating a glowing map of the very first cells to be infected with a HIV-like virus. Through an animal model, the scientists showed for the first time that HIV enters cells throughout the entire female reproductive tract from the labia to the ovary, not just the cervix, as previously thought.  It s a technical achievement that provides immediate insights into the earliest transmission events,  said lead investigator Thomas Hope, professor of cell and molecular biology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  Now we know which areas are vulnerable to HIV and can investigate why does the virus get in here and not everywhere else?  The HIV transmission study was recently published in Cell Host & Microbe.  If we are going to stop women from getting infected, we have to stop the very first cells from getting infected,  Hope said.  A week after the initial infection, there are hundreds of thousands of infected cells, and it s very difficult to stop. If you can stop it earlier, then you have a chance.  Any strategies to efficiently prevent HIV acquisition in women likely needs to protect the entire female reproductive tract, Hope said. Hope and colleagues removed the guts from the virus and inserted a gene from lightning bugs and another gene from a fluorescent protein to generate a reporter virus. Then they mixed the reporter virus with the real HIV-like virus. The glowing cells infected by the reporter revealed the site of infection with the real virus. The result: after being transmitted to the host, the real virus appeared in clusters of about 20 to 30 infected cells within 48 hours.  Without the new technology,  scientists would have to take a million little sections to see if they found evidence of the virus,  Hope said.  In the research, scientists used rhesus macaques and a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that is generally analogous to HIV. The discovery will help scientists design a more effective vaccine to protect women from HIV.   For a vaccine to be effective, you don t just need your arsenal of weapons but they need to be in the right place at the right time,  Hope said.  If you show up a day late or don t bring enough weapons, it s too late. Now we can see the chink in the armor of the virus. If you can attack it early instead of late, you can stop it.  Northwestern scientists discovered the primary target of transmission is the Th17 cell, a minority but important population of T cells in the first line of immune defense. It was previously known that they are depleted early in HIV and SIV infections. Within 48 hours of infection, scientists can see evidence of the battle between the virus and the Th17 cell.   We can see infected dead cells, infected cells being eaten by other cells to control them, and cells that kill themselves (apoptosis),  Hope said.  The virus is causing all those things, and it shows the battle between the virus and infected host begins immediately upon infection.  The article is titled:  Th17 Cells Are Preferentially Infected Very Early after Vaginal Transmission of SIV in Macaques. ","Published: April 29, 2016"

Tumors from patients with advanced NSCLC are routinely screened for the presence of EGFR mutations, with these mutations occurring in approximately 10 to 20 percent of NSCLC patients. The study is being conducted at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center under the direction of Giuseppe Giaccone, MD, PhD, Associate Director for Clinical Research for the MedStar Health Cancer Network's Washington Region and an internationally recognized expert in the field of lung cancer and developmental therapeutics. Biocept will monitor various clinically validated biomarkers in patients with lung cancer, including EGFR, MET, ALK and BRAF, using its proprietary circulating tumor cell (CTC) and cell free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dual platform technology. Data from the study is expected to further build and strengthen the clinical utility for Biocept's blood-based biomarker testing platforms.  Studying various forms of resistance mechanisms allows us to further expand upon and develop evidence supporting the utility of clinically actionable personalized treatment information for patients with metastatic lung cancer,  said Veena Singh, MD, Biocept's Senior Vice President and Senior Medical Director.  Treatment with currently approved targeted TKI therapies have known benefits for patients with various EGFR activating mutations; however, nearly all of these patients will eventually develop resistance to their therapies, which results in disease progression.   Our study is focusing on identifying active evolving resistance mechanisms through blood-based testing in order to monitor the mutations in the tumor and importantly identify real-time treatment options for these patients,  added Dr. Singh.  We are delighted to be collaborating on this study with highly respected Dr. Giaccone and a top-tier institution such as MedStar Georgetown.   Current standard of care is to use tumor biopsies by invasive surgical techniques or interventional radiology to both re-stratify patients with NSCLC when signs of progression are identified and to monitor these patients for key mechanisms of resistance,  said Dr. Giaccone.  These biopsies have a quantifiable rate of complications and risk. The ability to identify resistance mechanisms through blood-based liquid biopsy monitoring allows for detection and analysis without the need to obtain more tissue. ","Published: April 29, 2016"

Rova-T is a novel biomarker-specific therapy that is derived from cancer stem cells and targets delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) that is expressed in more than 80 percent of SCLC patient tumors and is not present in healthy tissue. Registrational trials for third-line small cell lung cancer are expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016. ""AbbVie is committed to continued innovation in oncology, a critical component of our long-term growth and an area of significant need to millions of patients worldwide,"" said Richard A. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer, AbbVie. ""The addition of Stemcentrx and its late-stage compound Rova-T provide AbbVie with a unique platform in solid tumor therapeutics and complement our leadership position in hematologic oncology. We believe the acquisition of Stemcentrx will strengthen and accelerate our ability to deliver innovative therapies that will have a remarkable impact on patients' lives."" In Phase 1/2 studies of relapsed SCLC patients who have previously failed one or more standard therapies, Rova-T demonstrated overall response rates of 44 percent in the patients identified with high expression of DLL3. The expression of DLL3 suggests Rova-T also may be useful across multiple tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, where DLL3 expression ranges from 50-80 percent. Rova-T combines a targeted antibody that delivers a cytotoxic agent directly to the DLL3-expressing cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells. Rova-T is under investigation as a third-line treatment in SCLC, where there is no currently approved therapy. Rova-T also has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Breakthrough Therapy designation. Additional data on Rova-T, including overall survival data, will be presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2016. Rova-T was recently selected to be included in the Best of ASCO Program, which presents scientific and educational highlights from the meeting. Approximately one percent of all data abstracts are selected for this program. Studies designed to select a Rova-T regimen for first-line registration will be starting soon. ""Rova-T is the first predictive biomarker-based therapy associated with drug efficacy in small cell lung cancer, and that is a big deal for this difficult disease,"" said Charles Rudin, M.D., Ph.D., chief, thoracic oncology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Beyond Rova-T, Stemcentrx has four novel compounds in clinical trials across several solid tumor indications including triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Stemcentrx has additional pre-clinical compounds advancing toward clinical trials in 2016 and a proprietary technology platform that leverages stem cell biology to identify and screen potential targets against live tumor tissue to more predictably advance discovery and development of new assets.  ""We are thrilled to be joining the AbbVie team and believe that, together, we can bring much-needed therapies to cancer patients,"" saidBrian Slingerland, founder and chief executive officer, Stemcentrx. ""We have worked for eight years exploring the origins of cancer and drivers of its recurrence and have discovered novel therapeutic targets to attack the most difficult-to-treat tumors. AbbVie, with its long-term commitment and expertise in drug development, will help us turn our scientific discoveries into a mainstay of cancer treatments."" AbbVie's clinical oncology pipeline is comprised of more than a dozen assets, with 5 programs in late-stage development, spanning nearly 200 clinical trials across more than 19 types of tumors.  AbbVie currently markets Imbruvica , a BTK-inhibitor approved to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and VenclextaTM, a BCL-2 inhibitor approved to treat CLL in patients with 17p deletion.","Published: April 29, 2016"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cell-transplant-treats-parkinsons-in-mice-190137,Cell Transplant Treats Parkinson s in Mice  A University of Wisconsin Madison neuroscientist has inserted a genetic switch into nerve cells so a patient can alter their activity by taking designer drugs that would not affect any other cell   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The cells in question are neurons and make the neurotransmitter dopamine, whose deficiency is the culprit in the widespread movement disorder Parkinson s disease. Dopamine is a brain chemical essential for coordinated movement. Dopamine replacement, a standard therapy for Parkinson s disease, usually loses its effect with time and, with the advent of stem cell technology, biomedical researchers have explored the notion of making dopamine-producing cells in the lab for transplant. And while doctors have tested dopamine cell transplants, the therapy often fails when the transplanted cells make either too much or too little of the essential neurotransmitter. In a recently published study  a professor of neuroscience at the UW Madison Waisman Center, created two related cell types. When they detect the designer drug, one type ramps up production of dopamine; the other chokes it off. Zhang and co-first authors Yuejun Chen and Man Xiong grew the specialized nerve cells from human embryonic stem cells, which are able to form any of the 220 cell types in the human body. Their behavioral tests, designed to show when the Parkinson s symptoms abated in the mice, confirmed that both the  up  and  down  switches performed as anticipated. The results suggest that it may one day be possible to resume dopamine neuron transplants to assist Parkinson s disease patients. But the ability to transplant cells that respond to regulatory drugs could have much wider application, says Zhang, who pioneered the transformation of embryonic stem cells into neural cells.  I m a neuro guy, and the Parkinson s disease model is very well established in mice   you can measure the outcome in their behavior. If the animal recovers, it must be due to the secretion of dopamine from the transplanted cell.  Mice with a model of Parkinson s disease received neural cells that could make dopamine. In the video above, the cells were activated with a designer drug, and the symptoms of Parkinson s disappeared. The ability to turn in both directions shows that the transplanted cells were providing a useful level of dopamine. In the second video, the mice turn only to the right, because they had received a drug that further activates transplanted cells. Both videos are three times normal speed.  Cells tend to have quite specific actions, and the ability to control them with benign drugs could find other uses, Zhang says. In diabetes, for example,  perhaps the beta cells that secrete insulin could be transplanted, and the patients could control insulin secretion with a designer drug.  The current advance was built with a new, highly precise form of  gene editing  called CRISPR. The new technique replaces the scattershot method of moving genes with something that resembles the  find and replace  command in a word processor that puts the insertion only at the desired location. Cell therapy was one of the most touted potential benefits of embryonic stem cells and the stem cells that were later derived from adult tissue (both technologies pioneered at UW Madison), but few applications have reached the clinic as the technology continues to be refined and made safer. Control is part of the problem, Zhang says:  If we are going to use cell therapy, we need to know what the transplanted cell will do. If its activity is not right, we may want to activate it, or we may need to slow or stop it.  Zhang considers the discovery one the most exciting in his substantial record of scientific firsts. The mouse study showed both abilities, says Zhang, who anticipates that cells will also be engineered to contain switches that work in both directions. Several major steps will be needed before the first clinical trial can be started. These include:   Proving the safety of the genetically engineered stem cells, and of the drugs used for control purposes.   Choosing transplants with maximum potential for natural, neural control of dopamine secretion.   Ensuring that the neurons reach the brain location where dopamine is needed to control movement.   Passing nonhuman primate studies.  We need to prove that this is not just a mouse phenomenon,  Zhang says,  that this really works to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease.  Such studies are already underway, he adds. Despite those hurdles, Zhang considers the discovery one the most exciting in his substantial record of scientific firsts. After the engineered cells are transplanted into the mouse brain, he says,  we can turn them on or off, up or down, using a designer drug that can only act on cells that express the designer receptor. The drug does not affect any host cell because they don t have that specialized receptor. It s a very clean system.  The study shows, for the first time with a human stem cell transplant, that because of this new technology of gene editing, you can remotely regulate the function of the transplanted cell, one that is reversible. If you take away the drug, it comes back. Many other conditions could benefit from this approach, Zhang says.  This is the first proof of principle, using Parkinson s disease as the model, but it may apply to many other diseases, and not just neurological diseases. ","Published: April 29, 2016"

Cyanide poisoning can cause nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, thirst, lethargy, nervousness, joint and muscle various aches and pains, and falling blood pressure. In extreme cases it is fatal. Studies indicate 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-off exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or  ARfD ) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose. Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370mg), without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers the amount would be 60mg which is about half of one small kernel. Apricot fruit is not affected Normal consumption of apricot fruit does not pose a health risk to consumers. The kernel is the seed from inside the apricot stone. It is obtained by cracking open and removing the hard stone shell and, therefore, has no contact with the fruit. Most raw apricot kernels sold in the EU are believed to be imported from outside the EU and marketed to consumers via the internet. Sellers promote them as a cancer-fighting food and some actively promote intakes of 10 and 60 kernels per day for the general population and cancer patients, respectively.  Evaluating the claimed benefits of raw apricot kernels for cancer treatment or any other use is outside EFSA s food safety remit and was, therefore, not part of this scientific opinion. EFSA consulted its partners in EU Member States to discuss this scientific opinion and previous assessments by national authorities (see report below). This risk assessment will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate EU food safety. They will decide if measures are needed to protect public health from consumption of raw apricot kernels.","Published: April 29, 2016"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/releasing-cancer-cells-for-better-analysis-207139,Releasing Cancer Cells for Better Analysis A new device developed at the University of Michigan could provide a non invasive way to monitor the progress of an advanced cancer treatment  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It can pick cancer cells out of a blood sample and let them go later, enabling further tests that can show whether the therapy is successfully ridding the patient of the most dangerous cancer cells. Cells released into the bloodstream by tumors could be used to monitor cancer treatment, but they are very difficult to capture, accounting for roughly one in a billion cells, says Sunitha Nagrath, U-M assistant professor of chemical engineering. Nagrath and her collaborators pioneered technologies for capturing these cells from blood samples. Their devices trapped the cells on chips made with graphene oxide, a single layer of carbon and oxygen atoms. But all analysis had to be done on the chip because the cells were firmly stuck. ""We could grow the cells on the chip or analyze them all together, but research has shown that cancer cells are not all the same,"" she said. ""Hence, it is important to study cells individually, and our new device makes this possible."" The stem cell theory of cancer holds that relapses occur because chemotherapy and radiation therapy are not very effective at killing cancer stem cells, which can make up as much as 10 percent of a tumor. As a result, the cancer stem cells left behind are able to regrow the tumor or spread to other areas of the body. New treatments in clinical trials attack the stem cells, but killing this smaller population does not immediately shrink the tumor. Doctors need a good way to monitor whether the cancer stem cells are on the decline. This may be possible through blood tests, but clinicians need to study captured cells individually, and that means removing them from the chip. ""How can we release the cell without damaging it that's the name of the game,"" said Jinsang Kim, U-M professor of materials science and engineering, who co-led the project with Nagrath. Kim works on design principles for creating chain-like molecules with particular capabilities, and his team devised a solution. His group developed a polymer that is solid at room temperature but falls apart at a temperature that can be set anywhere between about 40 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The polymer dissolves in water when it interacts with water molecules. At higher temperatures, heat breaks up the interactions, so the polymer doesn't dissolve. Apoorv Shanker, a graduate student in macromolecular science and engineering, set the polymer to dissolve at temperatures below 54 degrees. The team mixed the tiny cell-catching graphene oxide flakes into the polymer and built the chip into a device to guide the blood sample over it. ""It's very gentle for the cells,"" said Nagrath, contrasting the slight dip in temperature with other designs that rely on heating or enzyme-induced chemical reactions to release the cells. The device can capture and live-release up to 80 percent of the cancer cells in the initial blood sample. Then, the clinicians could collect the cells into a tissue-like sample for conventional analysis, which can reveal the proportion of captured cancer cells that are stem cells. Alternatively, they could identify single cells for more detailed study, such as full genetic sequencing or tests that identify which drugs would be most effective. ""Because the device is easy and cost-effective to make, large-scale clinical studies are possible,"" Kim said. The study was done in collaboration with the group of Max Wicha, U-M professor of oncology, and the group of Diane Simeone, professor of surgery and molecular & integrative physiology. It is described in the paper, ""Tunable Thermal-Sensitive Polymer-Graphene Oxide Composite for Efficient Capture and Release of Viable Circulating Tumor Cells,"" which recently appeared in Advanced Materials.","Published: April 29, 2016"
